Dino-Hunter Gunboat

I've a feeling this is a bit late, but there you go.

The corrected version of the Dino-Hunter (no actual changes, just added full
stats for the laser, etc.)

The Dino-Hunter Gunboat

Spire Areospace, the FLN's (Fulton League of Nations, Fulton, Canopus/2228)
premiere aero-space design bureau is pleased to be able to present the Dino-
Hunter Gunboat.

The Dino-Hunter is intended to be a small, and thus relatively cheap in-system
gunboat. The intention is to provide a powerful vessel capable of taking on
civilian and light military vessels and disabling them rapidly, but at a
fraction of the cost of larger SDBs such as the Fultons (see SARA0035 on the
BARD site). At MCr 318.62 (MCrimp 270.827) the Dino-Hunter may seem expensive,
but consider what you get - a gunboat encased in 12cm of Superdense armour,
capable of protecting major systems from any manned ex-Imperial or ex-Solomani
turret laser and critical systems from any known laser and PAWS up to 1.8GJ
discharge energy, a meson screen strong enough to defeat a 2GJ Meson gun found
on some pre-Collapse light combatants, and that's assuming she even hit! With
her masking, powerful jammer and over 400 decoys Dino-Hunter will be able to
avoid hostile fire entirely in many engagements. All this and she still carries
the firepower to rapidly disable ships many times its size.

The Dino-Hunter is equipped with both fuel scoops and a purification plant so
that it may refuel whist on patrol and extend its four month cruising duration
indefinately. For comfort on these extended patrols the crew's living quarters
and workstations are equipped with gravitic compensation, which also protects
them from the effects of evasive manoeuvring. With her 4G drives she is capable
of reaching orbit in 20 minutes from most planetary surfaces, and has fuel for
12.5 hours at maximum thrust - more than enough for any engagement. When she
goes into battle she'll use her two fire-directors to control up to eight
missiles at a time, fired from two barbettes, each carrying six standard 7m^3
missiles (and she carries 12 more in reserve). Alternatively she can direct
fire onto targets several light-seconds away from her twin 400MJ laser turrets.

We also offer the option of changing either or both of the Dino-Hunter's
standard missile barbettes for the 4m^3 light missile barbette (carries twelve
missiles and saves MCr0.0476 per barbette) or for the 10.5m^3 heavy missile
barbette (holds four, no price adjustment). Obviously the reserve missile load
will change accordingly. Spare barbettes, along with other parts and munitions
may be bought with vessels at discount.

Dino-Hunter's are available to members of the Republic of Keluin with the usual
subsidies, and to external system governments upon approval by the Department
of Extra-Republic Affairs. Training for crew and ground support staff is
available, as is simulation software and full-scale simulators if required.

As we here at Spire feel that the missiles normally used in the 7m^3 tube are a
bit anemic and don't really suit vessels like the Dino's we thought we'd offer
a more suitable munition - the Dino-Killer missile:
