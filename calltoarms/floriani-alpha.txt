Floriani Alpha-Class Gunboat
by  "Snapping Turtle" <meancooter@yahoo.com>
 
The Floriani Alpha-Class Gunboat  is part of a series of similar, yet
complementary 300 ton gunboats produced for the Floriani navy. These craft
are not intended to operate singly, but as part of an balanced task force.

As a class, these gunboats generally sacrifice weaponry and endurance to
high speed and heavy armor. This is consistent with the initial Floriani
design concept which was to use gunboats to break through opposing lines of
fighters in order to bring overwhelming force to bear on the escort vessels
of the enemy. They are strictly creatures of space, as they can only operate
from orbital facilities or larger carrier craft.

It is proposed that the Regency purchase several of these gunboat
flotillasin order to test their suitability use as system defense squadrons.
Initial evaluations indicate that the synergistic interaction of the
different variants which comprise such squadrons produces a defensive value
considerably exceeding their relative cost. Purchase of such foreign built
systems will also alleviate some of the strain on Regency shipyards in the
current (1140) crisis

The main armament of this craft is a forward-firing spinal particle
accelerator. It also has two missile barbettes mounted port and starboard
with six missiles each, a dorsally mounted 180Mj gravitically focussed laser
turret, and a ventrally mounted sandcaster turret
