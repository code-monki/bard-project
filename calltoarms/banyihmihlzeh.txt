 by Yves SIMON <yves.simon6@free.fr>


Here is my second ship for call to arms. This is a assault shuttle designed
to carry battle-dressed marines inside an enemy ship. I will also post the
TL-15 version. This ship is not designed to enter a atmosphere. So it should
not be working on it's own...

-----
Built by Nyolenambih Inc. in it's shipyards on Darrian (0627 Spinward
Marches), the Banyihmihlzeh is one of the most resistant and reliable ship
built by this company, designed to survive laser turret hits before
unloading its complement of 30 Battle-Dressed marines.

This ship is named after a small fish native from Zamine (0421 Spinward
Marches). This small Piranha like fish, kill it prey by latching on it and
injecting acidic juices.

Encased under 10cm of Bonded Super Dense plating, this ship is capable of
surviving a direct hit from a 140 Mj laser hit without any damages. It is
also fitted with an EMM Masker system and two 180,000 km EMS Jammers. Along
with it's 6G of accelleration and more than 60 G-Turns of reaction-mass,
this ensure that the ship will be able to close on it's opponent.

Once near its opponent (within 1km), the three Magnetic Grapples can be
fired on the ennemy and the ship towed against it's opponent hull. Once
withing 100 meters from the target, three 350 Mj Fusion Guns are used to
punch a hole in the hull.

For it's defense, the ship rely on a 180 Mj Laser Turret and a SandCaster
Turret. Most of ship's important systems have a backup: AEMS, PEMS, PEMS
antenna, etc. It was clear that the best possible sensors would be used in
this ship on the active side.

Unfortunatelly all those systems means that the crew accommodation can be
considered as cramped. Ship's crew have double-occupancy smal staterooms,
while the marines are accomodated in bunks. Although a sick bay and a medic
are included to treat casualties during and after boarding actions, crew
moral will certainly be low and should be rotated.

A downgraded TL:F version is also available to be built in other shipyards
in the regency.

The Grapples comes from the oct 15 post...
Magnetic Anchor: A magnet tipped grapple(s) that is shot from a boarding
vessel using compressed gas or
explosive charge. Boarding crews can either winch the ships together, or use
boarding cables to alight to
the offending ships hull.

Multiply the volume of the boarding ship by 0.02 to get the volume of the
grapple and its launch
apparatus. An anchor has a maximum range of 1km, and hitting a disabled
vessel is an average task with
energy weapons or field artillery skills. Against a accelerating vessel this
becomes a difficult task, and
formidable against a maneuvering vessel. The difficulty of this task is
reduced for every anchor
fitted, but seperate to hit rolls are needed for each anchor used. In BL it
takes one turn to grapple a
ship, and one more turn to board the craft. During the actual boarding
phase, the pilot must make an average
skill roll to maintain the vessels station.

As for penetrating the opponent hull, each of the fusion guns can punch
through 15cm of BSD armor and have 5 shots each...
