Floriani Beta-Class Gunboat
by "Snapping Turtle" <meancooter@yahoo.com>
 
The Floriani Beta-Class Gunboat is part of a series of similar, yet
complementary 300 ton gunboats produced for the Floriani navy. These craft
are not intended to operate singly, but as part of an balanced task force.

As a class, these gunboats generally sacrifice weaponry and endurance to
high speed and heavy armor. This is consistent with the initial Floriani
design concept which was to use gunboats to break through opposing lines of
fighters in order to bring overwhelming force to bear on the escort vessels
of the enemy. They are strictly creatures of space, as they can only operate
from orbital facilities or larger carrier craft.

It is proposed that the Regency purchase several of these gunboat
flotillasin order to test their suitability use as system defense squadrons.
Initial evaluations indicate that the synergistic interaction of the
different variants which comprise such squadrons produces a defensive value
considerably exceeding their relative cost. Purchase of such foreign built
systems will also alleviate some of the strain on Regency shipyards in the
current (1140) crisis

This is the electronic warfare variant which is used for command and control
of a mixed flotilla of 4-5 craft of this class. In accordance with its
picket functions, it has longer endurance than other vessels of this class.
It carries two gravitically focussed laser turrets mounted ventrally and
dorsally, and two missile barbettes mounted port and starboard (each with 6
missiles).
