Alston League Series 200 Gunboat
by Antony Farrell" <Skaran@bigpond.com>
 
Well I'm a dill, though probably too late now, the original design had the
wrong main weapon fitted! which resulted in a ship where although everything
fit the ship was grossly overweight, the following corrects this.

The Alston League, situated in the Banners Sector has just placed an order
for twelve of these boats to supplement the larger system defence boats in
the league navy. Built around a 400Mw laser lance and carrying two missile
barbettes the gunboat is able to take on a variety of targets, including
smaller warships.

These vessels are now offered for sale to customers, either built locally at
the Alston yards or licence built. Against the typical virus infected ship
they are a potent weapon. Built using an airframe hull the gunboats can also
be used in a ground attack role where the laser and missiles can be used to
good effect.

If there is a weakness in the design it is in the armour. In order to fit
the large laser many compromises had to be made, these being principally in
reduced armour. The lasers rate of fire of 200/30 minutes was also below
that originally specified.
