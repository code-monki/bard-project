Pihbhebaldelyo Class Patrol Cruiser
by Yves SIMON <yves.simon6@free.fr>

Nyolenambih Inc. is proud to present you it's most own refit of the
ubiquitous Patrol Cruiser. The Pihbhebaldelyo is an TL-15 upgrade of
this venerable ship.

It have more armor and fire power than the original design while keeping
the same performances (Jump 3, 4G). More, the ship have more available
re-mass the
before (40G-turns instead of only 30), meaning longer engagement and
better evasion possibilities.

The main armament consists in two spinal 750Mj lasers and two 150Mj
Laser turrets. The original missiles turrets have been replaced by two
sandcaster turrets to
help protect the ship against enemy fire. The protection is also assured
by eight centimeters of Bonded Super Dense armor plating instead of only
one and a half. The
ship is also protected against meson-based weaponry by a 5 MW meson
screen.

Compared to the original Imperial design, the ship only lose it's
30-dTons ship's boat hangar.

On the electronic side, the ship has all it's detection & communication
systems doubled, and possess two EMS jammers and an EM Masking system
making it
harder to detect and to hit.

The crew was not forgotten, as the ship can accomodate in dual occupancy
large staterooms (single occupancy small staterooms for officers) and
have a spare large
stateroom for recreation purpose (often fitted with video equipment).
