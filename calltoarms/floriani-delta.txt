Floriani Delta-Class Gunboat
by "Snapping Turtle" <meancooter@yahoo.com>
 
The Floriani D-Class Gunboat is part of a series of similar, yet
complementary 300 ton gunboats produced for the Floriani navy. These craft
are not intended to operate singly, but as part of an balanced task force.

As a class, these gunboats generally sacrifice weaponry and endurance to
high speed and heavy armor. This is consistent with the initial Floriani
design concept which was to use gunboats to break through opposing lines of
fighters in order to bring overwhelming force to bear on the escort vessels
of the enemy. They are strictly creatures of space, as they can only operate
from orbital facilities or larger carrier craft.

It is proposed that the Regency purchase several of these gunboat
flotillasin order to test their suitability use as system defense squadrons.
Initial evaluations indicate that the synergistic interaction of the
different variants which comprise such squadrons produces a defensive
valueconsiderably exceeding their relative cost. Purchase of such foreign
built systems will also alleviate some of the strain on Regency shipyards in
the current (1140) crisis

With its extra EW capability, twin forward-firing 750 mj
gravitically-focused spinal x-ray lasers and 50 ton missile bay (with six
launchers and 56 missiles) the Delta-class variant is probably the
best-balanced--and deadliest--craft of this class.
