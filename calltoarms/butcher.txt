  Butcher
  
  by Michael Koehne  

 
  Gushemege has a old Lancian tradition to distinct between Pulehov as
  the foreign army is called and Silkku as the peoples army is called.

  The fleets of the Distributed Republic of Rurevayn had been seen as
  Pulehov. Just an other foreign army, stepping in the shoes of Vilani,
  Solomani, and Imperial armies. But the DRR did'nt cover the complete
  Gushemege. Most areas had been visited by the Guild fleets, only.
  
  Brinn expansions in 1203 showed, that frontier areas are'nt save. 

  The cluster of receptor worlds of Kell, Fubanan and Aakmi offered
  an attractive target to the first Brinn expansion. The run of fender
  worlds from 2704 to 3202 formed the secondary Brinn objective in 1204,
  with ultimate exploitation to Kukhun in 1205 and its neighbouring
  receptor worlds.
  
  The Guild lost most trade in Tansa because of the genocidial war
  the Brinn are known for. Suddenly the Pulehov of the DRR became
  welcomed guests in any system. Call to arms is out for the Silkku.
