Trahiy'arl Planetary Defense Fighter 
by Norma Guye <ferrosmith@yahoo.com>
 
General Info: The Trahiy'arl is a common fighter in
the Aslan Hierate, used by poorer clans to defend
their holdings against attack. This version is
stripped of most of its Aslan weaponry, as Wyaroaer
takes advantage of the Regency's need for defensive
craft. As such it is intended to be fitted with
Regency TL-15 computers and powerplants. The original
Aslan version is a fat waddling toad barely capable of
3G, and carries a little more armor than the export
model. The Regency version retains the originals power
shortfall, but since the fighter is intended for long
range patrols, this is usually fixed by not running
the contra-grav or the AEMS with everything else. The
lack of space also requires hot-bunking by the crew on
extend long range patrols.

Another less than desirable tradeoff is the lack of a
modern decoy or ECM system, but space limitations
would not allow for it, and some of the more hirsute
Aslan clans prefer the direct approach over jamming
and diversion tactics. But the fighters 4.5 Cm of
bonded superdense is more than enough of a defense,
especially where squadrons of these fighters can
operate. During the Ihatei invasions, Denebian pilots
learned to not disregard this lethal fighter, noting
that "to sneeze it off is a waste of ones last
breath." The original model only mounted a single
laser lance, and the dual mounting seems to have been
an afterthought; otherwise the missle tubes are the
centerpiece of this class. In addition to the four
loaded missles, eight more are carried in the hold.

Trahiy'arl's most impressive feature is its long
endurance, as it is not overpowering enough to defeat
larger vessels in direct combat. Rather the Aslan
prefer to deploy them in pairs, sniping at enemy ships
and wearing down their defenses. Another more common
attack plan is simply to get as many of these fighters
as one can, and simply saturate and enemy's defenses
with as many missles as one can. Interestingly,
Ftuakh's deal doesn't include any missles (32.4 Mcr)
but then Wyaroaer wants to keep this sale as quiet as
possible, and selling ordinance may piss off some of
the more conservative males in Eakhitiyo, a clan not
known for its warmth towards the Regency anyway.
