Nggemehndelayrih Class Heavy Fighter TL 16
by Yves SIMON <yves.simon6@free.fr>
 
Built by Nyolenambih Inc. in it's shipyards on Darrian (0627 Spinward
Marches), the Nggemehndelayrih is one of the most recent heavy fighter type
produced in the Confederation.

This ship is named after a social flying insect similar to Terran Hornets.

The main weapon of this fighter is a 800 Mj laser lance capable of
penetrating over 50 centimeters of Bonded Super Dense plating. The secondary
weapons are six HEPlaR 0.5dT detonation laser missiles designed for long
distance attacks and two 23mm Gauss autocannons for atmospheric combat.

The fighter is well protected under 4 cm of BSD armor and is equiped of both
an EMM and a decoy dispenser. It is also fast (6 G) and has a good autonomy
(110 G-Turns)

The fighter is crewed by three persons, a pilot, a gunner and a engineer/ EW
specialist. The fighter can operate on long patrol, the crew resting in a
small stateroom.

A downgraded TL:F version will also be available soon to be built in other
shipyards in the regency.
