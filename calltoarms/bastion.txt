Bastion / Bulwark Planetoid Missile Platforms
by "Richard Perks" <richard@rjperks.freeserve.co.uk>
 
For all those TL 8 planets with moderate populations who can't afford those
nice TL15 Imperial standard warships (or the cheap vargr knock offs), and
have not got the starport or heavy infrastructure for building fancy
starship hulls; there are two designs to provide close in protection for the
system mainworld against commercial vampires.
The vessels are wholly TL8 construction for ease of maintenance and to
reduce balance of payments problems. They are designed to be placed in orbit
around the main world and to remain hidden pretending to be minor moons or
old belter mining sites until the unsuspecting vampire closes in to perform
planetary bombardment.

They are designed to operate in groups of three; 1 bastion command base and
2 bulwark missile bases - Total cost MCR 92.47693 approx half the cost of a
dragon class SDB but with twice the fire power.

They are based upon the planetoid hull rules devised by Rupert Boleyn and
listed on the BARD pages. Missiles where chosen as the main armament due to
the poor laser performance and lack of fusion PP at this TL.

The bastion will detect the vampire and handoff sensor locks to the more
heavy armed bulwarks via the laser coms.

Engineering Data:
Power Plant: 12MW Fuel Cell, Duration 1 day combat, 15 days standby
operation
Jump Performance: 0
Maneuver Gs: 0
G Hours: 0
Maint: 48

Electronics:
Computer: 3 x TL8 FIB
Commo: Radio 3,000km; 3 x laser com, 300,000km
Avionics: None
Sensors: Radar, 30,000km; High Resolution Thermal, 60,000km  (both fixed
arrays)
Armament: 2 standard TL8 Missile turrets each with 2 ready missiles (Loc
10/11 Arcs: all)
Accommodation:
Extended life support
Crew 7 (1 command, 3 elec, 2 gun, 1 medic)
Workstations: 4 bridge, 1 normal, 2 gunnery
Crew Accommodations: 2 small staterooms, 5 bunks, 5 low berths
Cargo: 7 cubic metres
Small craft: 1 x 8Dtn Docking ring + launch port. (no craft carried)
Airlocks 2:

Notes: No fuel scoops or plant. Fuel: 518.4kl HG Hyd. The ship has been
provided with a full bridge to allow ease of sensor lock handoffs to the
bulwarks via laser com.
The ship configuration is unsuitable for spin, so only the medic and 1 elec
operator are normally awake (and are rotated planetside every month to
prevent zero g effects building up), the remainder of the crew are frozen
and are awakened if a vampire is detected. The additional bunks are provided
for the crew (staterooms used by the medic and the elec - except when the
commander is awakened, when he gets bumped down to a bunk).
Full power operation is with the radar running full 12MW output, standby is
with everything else running but no radar. Standby days can be traded for
combat days at the ratio of 3 to 1.
The missile armament is for self defense or when sensor locks can not be
passed to the two escorting bulwarks.
