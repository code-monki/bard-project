Floriani Gamma-Class Gunboat
by "Snapping Turtle" <meancooter@yahoo.com>

The Floriani Gamma-Class Gunboat is part of a series of similar, yet
complementary 300 ton gunboats produced for the Floriani navy. These craft
are not intended to operate singly, but as part of an balanced task force.

As a class, these gunboats generally sacrifice weaponry and endurance to
high speed and heavy armor. This is consistent with the initial Floriani
design concept which was to use gunboats to break through opposing lines of
fighters in order to bring overwhelming force to bear on the escort vessels
of the enemy. They are strictly creatures of space, as they can only operate
from orbital facilities or larger carrier craft

It is proposed that the Regency purchase several of these gunboat flotillas
in order to test their suitability use as system defense squadrons. Initial
evaluations indicate that the synergistic interaction of the different
variants which comprise such squadrons produces a defensive value
considerably exceeding their relative cost. Purchase of such foreign built
systems will also alleviate some of the strain on Regency shipyards in the
current (1140) crisis

The Gamma version is one of the few craft of its size in known space which
sports a meson gun. While this forward-firing weapon is extremely light, it
is nonetheless effective against escort vessels or civilian craft not
equipped with meson screens. The missile barbettes to port and starboard
(stowing six 7m3 missiles each) are reserved for longer-ranged targets,
while the craft also boasts a highly effective dorsally-mounted manned
gravitic-focused laser and a ventral mount sandcaster turret.
