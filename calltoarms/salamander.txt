 
Salamander Gunboat
by Lewis Roberts
                          
The Salamander Gunboat was designed to answer the Regency's need for system
defense craft capable of dealing with attacking Vampire ships. The boat is
highly specialized for this mission and has little utility other than
combat. The boat was designed to maximize offensive punch. The boat is
designed to take up station and defend it from all comers.

The boat is armed with two custom built laser bays. Each laser bay has six
750 Mj non-grav focused laser cannons. This adds up to 9 gigajoules of
laser energy being pumped out. This is a fearsome ammount for such a small
craft. The cannon's range is fairly short due to the lack of gravitic
focusing. This is acceptable becuase the vessel was designed for combat
against attacking forces who must advance into the Salamander's range. Each
bay is controlled by a MFD on the bridge. In the event that one of the MFDs
is knocked out, the other MFD can link both bays and fire them on the same
target.

The Salamander does not ignore defense. The boat is armored with 19.6 cm of
bonded superdense for a total armor value of 550. This is enough to shrug
off the standard Tl-15 150 MJ laser turret and to reduce the standard TL-14
300 MJ laser barbette to a minor hit. In addition the boat mounts three
state of the art sandcasters and three point defense lasers. These lasers
can shoot down incoming missiles or engage attacking small craft. To make
it more difficult for enemy craft to lock on, the Salamander has
electromagnetic masking, decoys and a long range EMS jammer.

Due to the massive amounts of armor, the craft is extremly heavy and
requires oversized engines and a corresponding large amount of fuel.

The Salamander is a spherical craft. The bridge is located at the center of
the sphere. It is surrounded by crew quarters. The engine room is at the
back of the sphere. Fuel tanks are mounted on the inside of the hull and
provide additional buffer between the enemy and the crew. It is a fairly
utilitarian vessel, and the insides are rather uninspired. The staterooms
are a bit cramped and fairly ugly with exposed pipes and cables running
through most spaces.

     It's not a sleek star knight ridding off to do battle, but an ugly
     little knife fighter of a ship.
