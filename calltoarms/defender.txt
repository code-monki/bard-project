Defender SDB 
by "DED" <dedly@snet.net>
 
I don't know if this is better but I've made various modifications based on
suggestions that were made (thanks again). The armaments are a little more
lethal, defenses more practical, the ship costs less, and has a bit more
fuel.

TL-15 Defender Class System Defense Boat

The Defender Class SDB is a 300 ton gunboat designed to take on enemy ships
much larger than itself. Intended as the last line of defense against
invading vampire ships, the Defender is built around a 3.6 GJ Particle
Accelerator spinal mount capable of blasting holes in the toughest of
opponents. Complementing the particle accelerator are two 1000 MJ Laser
Barbettes (non-gravitically focused).

The creation of confusion among one's opponents is also an important weapon.
To that end, the Defender employs electronic countermeasures. The Defender
comes with a 30 MW EMS Jammer (effective range 10 hexes), 30 sensor decoys
(10 Laser, 10 AEMS, 10 PEMS), and EM Masking (4.2 MW).

If you're going to fight with the big boys, you've got to be able to take a
hit as well. For defense the ship's outer hull is constructed of bonded
superdense 3.57cm thick, giving the ship an armor rating of 100. There are
also 2 Sandcasters.

Being part of the last line of defense means that you have to be in position
at the time of attack or, at the very least, shortly thereafter. To that
end, the Defender is capable of 6 G's of thrust and has enough fuel for 81
G-Turns. The fusion plant is rated at 1300 MW.

The Defender requires a crew of 13 and has accommodations for such.

The Defender costs 210.9 MCr to build. We feel that this price is reasonable
considering the high end performance and firepower of the ship. It is a
worthwhile investment for any world in or along the frontier.
