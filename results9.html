 Dear Zubdia,       <P>

 I was thinking of our next hologame of TimeWars.  The next portion of our
 campaign is to assault the Iron Fortress of the Cyrellian Hegemony.  I think the
 best force to assault the fortress would be made up of mechanized infantry with
 a strong armored element and backed up by various support units. Do you have any
 suggestions on unit we should use?  As you know we have enough chronopoints to
 pull several battalions from any ancient history period between the
 Vilani-Terran Interstellar Wars to the empires of the Virus Age.  I would
 suggest we keep our units between TL-9 and TL-13.  Using higher TL troops will
 make victory easier, but will lower our rankings in the Timelord standings.
 Send me your suggestions. Together I am sure we shall stand upon the rubble of
 the Iron Fortress.
 <P>
 Yours in Victory,

 Okay, in other words design a Armored Personal Carrier, an armored tank-like
 vehicle and any support craft you feel like.  The support craft can be artillery
 units, point defense craft, scouting and recon units, transports, maintenance
 vehicles, engineering vehicles, or what ever else your imagination can come up
 with.  The armored vehicle is supposed to fill the classical tank role, but
 doesn't have to be an actual tank.  Anything that has a large weapon capable of
 destroying armored opponents and is able to withstand large amounts of hostile
 fire would be  viable.
 <P>
 The contest will vote for the best combined force, but since everyone will not
 have time to generate a APC and a Tank we will also vote for favorite Tank, APC,
 and support craft.

We had  12 entries for the 8th Nebula Contest and 3 people voted.<P>

The vote totals were:<BR>


 I only received three votes in the latest Nebula Contest.  With that few votes
 compared to number of entries, the voting doesn't have any statistical
 significance.  Everyone of the first place vote getters also got lower rankings
 and the winning entry didn't get any first place votes.  I normally see this
 sort behavior in the early votes, but after 5-6 votes or so it normally settles
 down to a clear winner.

 Receiving first place votes were the <I>Bushfire</I> MBT (1),  <I>Kviir</I> K-4 Support (1)
 and the <I>Raptor Tank</I> (1).  The <I>Sunfire</I> and <I>Moonbow</I> were pushed up by the fact
 that since I voted, they only received two votes each.

Well hopefully the next contest will have more votes.
