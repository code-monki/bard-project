<P>
<B>December 22nd</B> Pete Grey is still spewing forth planet writeups, (to the tune of 30 something) and those dominate the new pages.  They are for Foreven, Spinward Marches and the Trojan Reaches.  There are also writeups of several subsectors for Foreven.  They are all on the <A HREF="./bard/bardopal.html">OPAL</a> Page. The only other addition is Gideon Vos, a NPC on the <A HREF="./bard/barddani.html">DANI</a> page.<P>

<B>November 28th</B> I added a huge number (30+) of planet write ups to the <A HREF="./bard/bardopal.html">OPAL</a> section, most are by Pete Grey, who's been spewing forth great quantities of material, I haven't even been able to keep up with all his designs. I also added Eamon Watter's write up of Hinterworlds Hashi subsector. Pete has been writing worlds for the Spinward Marches, Foreven and Trojan Reaches.  There were a bit too many to put them in the NIS page, so I added these sectors to the OPAL section.  I removed all the planet write ups from the NIS page.  I might move the NPCs also, but I'll wait until I have some more to convert.  I do have a large number of Regency NPCs that Alvin Plummer posted to the TML years ago.  If I get time I'll post them.
The NIS pages got a write up of Regency Naval designations.
<P>
The other sections of the BARD pages were not forgotten.  The <A HREF="./bard/bardgail.html">GAIL</a> section got a writeup on the technological progression of time keeping devices , rules for self-contained ETC rounds and for using repulser/tractors as engine.  The <A HREF="./bard/bardsara.html">SARA</a> page received the <I>Eaaseakh</I> System Defense Boat, the <I>Feiwoi'</I> Gunship, the TNE conversion of the CT Tukera Long Liner  the <I>Samson</I> Class Clipper and its <I>Manoh</I> fuel pack.  The <A HREF="./bard/bardvera.html">VERA</a> page got the entries for the 10th Nebula Contest, Projector Battldress and the winner :Cougar Assualt Battldress.  It also got a selection of Laser Barbettes and Turrets

<P>
A couple people asked about downloading the entire BARD pages so I zipped it up (except for the Manifest Destiny Campaign PDFs in the NIS section.) and put it on the web at: <a href="http://www.mauigateway.net/~lewis/bard.zip">http:://www.mauigateway.net/~lewis/bard.zip</A>.  I'll make semi-regular updates to it.  I think this version doesn't have all the latest OPAL writeups.
<P>
<B>October 22nd</B> Well its been quite a while since I updated the BARD pages. I apologize for that, but life's been busy.  I bought a house.  Updates should follow a little more regularly after this.  In the CARI section I added several articles about the Zhodani Consulate, before and after the Collapse and also about the Forlorn, a minor human race.  In the GAIL section I added an article about Coalition contact procedures and Cloning.  In the OPAL section I added a writeup of Dethenes in the Old Expanses as well as library data for Beyond sector.  In the SARA section I added the
<I>Rossi Nante</I> Far Trader.  In the VERA section I added a TNE conversion of the Classic Traveller <I>Horronon</I> ATV as well as standard Imperial laser turrets and meson guns.  I started to put up the entries in the 10th Nebula Contest.  In the <a href="nis.html">Naval Intelligance Pages</A> I added up an article about the power vacuum behind the Claw.
<P>
<B>June 24th</B> I added a bunch of files today. The <I>Pixie Dust</I> got a real name of the <I>Shinai</I> thanks to Jon Goff.  (A shinai is the wooden sword used in kendo).  I added the Forlorn minor human race to the
<A HREF="./bard/bardcari.html">CARI</a> page.  I added two religions to the
<A HREF="./bard/barddani.html">DANI</a> page, the Word of God and an article about the Ismya Vilani.  There are four world writeups based on the Word of God in the
<A HREF="./bard/bardopal.html">OPAL</a> section:
Mission/Massilia, Aneth/Old Expanses, Montero/Old Expanses and Kestrel/Old Expanses.   I also added a writeup for Thorell/Aubaine/Old Expanses.  Alvin Plummer wrote up several articles about Madoc subsector in Diaspora, they don't quite fit the canon universe, but they are really well done.  Even though they are written for the Rebellion I put them up. I also converted Eamon Watter's collapsed Hinterworlds to HTML.  The first subsector is up and the second will go up soon.  <P>
I added the adventure "A Ghost from the Past" to the
<A HREF="./bard/bardmari.html">MARI</a> section,
and the A(P)-11 Assassination Robot  featured in the adventure was added to the
<A HREF="./bard/bardvera.html">VERA</a> page, along with an article about drugs.
I put up an alternative version of the <I>Lancer</I> destroyer in the
<A HREF="./bard/bardsara.html">SARA</a> section.
Finally, I added Firelance Inc. to the
<A HREF="./bard/bardicis.html">ICIS</a> section.
<P>
<B>May 14th</B> I added the history of the Aslan to the
<A HREF="./bard/bardcari.html">CARI</a> page. I added Sydney Spacely and Max to the crew of the <I>Pixie Dust</I>.  In case you aren't on the TNE mailing list, we are trying to detail the crew of a pirate ship.  The name Pixie Dust is only a placeholder until someone comes up with a more interesting name.  The crew can be set in any campaign setting in 1200, if a certain crew member does not fit in a given campaign, it can simply be dropped.  For instance a renegade Hiver would be dropped for a Regency campaign.  If you are interested send me your contribution.  <P>
In the
<A HREF="./bard/bardvera.html">VERA</a>
section I added the <I>Juggernaut</I> Grav Tank, the <I>Alpha</I> and <I>Miracle</I> mines and the VMEV mine delivery system. Keeping in that trend, I added the <I>Jacobite</I> Minelayer to the
<A HREF="./bard/bardsara.html">SARA</a> section.  The
 <A HREF="./bard/bardgail.html">GAIL</a> section
 got rules for Planetoid hulls for use with <cite>Fire, Fusion & Steel</cite>
 <P>


<B>April 29th</B> The BARD pages are now an affiliate of <A href="http://www.downport.com">Downport.com</A>.  They were kind enough to provide web hosting.  I needed to get the pages of my grad school account and I thought this would add visibility to the pages.  Downport also hosts several other Traveller pages, so check them out.  Patrice Lemire sent in was inspired by some of the recent CIN articles and wrote up world descriptions for several new members of the RC in Oriflamme Subsector.  Broken Empath let me know some of the links in the VERA section were messed up, and I fixed them.  Also in
VERA I added the <I>Cheetah</I> APC.  I found out that the Jabberwock article in the CARI section had been overwritten by another page, and I put it back.  I also added an article about the Janx, an engimatic alien race in Zhodani space.
 .
<P>

<B>April 10</B> Dedly converted the 1120/1200 UWPs for Diaspora Sector to HTML and they now appear on the
<A HREF="./bard/bardopal.html">OPAL</a> page.
In addition there is a write up of the planet Keipes, and some possible developments there.  I also found some useful information about Galines and made a short write up of it.
Several new NPCs appear on the
<A HREF="./bard/barddani.html">DANI</a> page
: Demosthenes Maximilian Donohue, Whisper, the crew of the RCS <I>Hornet</I>,
Eibedo Oleido, Vega Zorn, the Vampire Lord Ship and its cohort in crime, Dr Manfred Strauss.  Also appearing are two religions
the Society for True Humanity and the  Aragishge Drandirdiikun.  The TNE mailing list has also started to detail a pirate ship and its crew.  A draft write up of the ship and its Captain O'Doyle is also on the DANI section.  The ship is supposed to be general enough that it can fit into any campaign, while the various NPCs can be from a particular setting.  If they are unsuited to a given campaign, they can be dropped.  Feel free to submit your own crew members. (The <I>Pixie Dust</I> is only a placeholder until a more interesting name can be chosen for the ship.)
<P>
On the
<A HREF="./bard/bardcari.html">CARI</a> page
I added an article about Smaetal Swarms and Ship's Cats. Several new CIN articles appear in the
 <A HREF="./bard/bardgail.html">GAIL</a> section
An adventure idea called "Surprise" and Operation: Turncoat appear in the
<A HREF="./bard/bardmari.html">MARI</a> section. The
<A HREF="./bard/bardsara.html">SARA</a> section
gets the <I>Sudniidbaa</I> Assault Carrier, its <I>Yolanda</I> Troop Transport, the <I>Patriot</I> Light Cruiser and the <I>Jayasuriya</I> Gunship. Finally the
<A HREF="./bard/bardvera.html">VERA</a>
gets the Schloobie and several new mines.


<P>
<B>March 19</B> I finished all the 9th Nebula Contest entries and they are all on the
<A HREF="./bard/bardvera.html">VERA</a>. Also there is the <I>Horrible-Skittery-Spider-Thing</I>, the
<I>Checker</I> Automated Transport, the  Coalition Reconnaissance Satellite and a collection of handguns from Jon Goff.
In the <A HREF="./bard/bardsara.html">SARA</a> section I added
the <I>Sudniidbaa</I> Assault Carrier and the <I>Pathfinder</I> Multimission Scout which was part of the 8th Nebula Contest.
The  <A HREF="./bard/bardgail.html">GAIL</a> section got a new set of rules for combat damage by Rupert Boleyn and several
new CIN articles.  I put up a world write up about Tama in So Skire subsector in the <A HREF="./bard/bardopal.html">OPAL</a>
section.  There are also a few web pages where I found minor typos and the like.  <P>


<B>March 6 2000</B>  Well its been quite a while since I updated the web page.  I apologize for that.  I have a fair sized
backlog of material to be put up.  I'll try to make weekly updates.  This week I put up the remaining starships from the
8th Nebula contest in the <A HREF="./bard/bardsara.html">SARA</a> section  along with two transports ships.
I started put up the entries for the 9th Nebula Contest in the <A HREF="./bard/bardvera.html">VERA</a> section
along with the Reformation Coalition standard mortar.
In the <A HREF="./bard/bardgail.html">GAIL</a> section I put up rules for player Fame and
recognition.  In the <A HREF="./bard/barddani.html">DANI</a> section I put up descriptions of Count Iqbal Haji and
Arywan Owen the "daughter" of Aybee Wan Owen from the old Traveller's Digest from DGP.  I also fixed up a few things
including the web page for the mailing list.  This includes using the current email address rather than a year old one.
That should prove to be more useful. :) I also upgraded the FAQ.
Hopefully next week I'll have the entries for the 9th Nebula Contest finished along with several robots.
<P>

<B>October 18th</B> I put up the announcement for the 9th Nebula Contest.  Its to build an assortment of armored vehicles.  I also put up the announcement for the results of the 8th Contest.  Nick Bradbeer's <I>Rhino Hunter</I> Scout won.  I'll post the rest of the entries soon. <P>

<B>October 3rd:</B> Lots of stuff got added today.  With help from Dedly I got several items from Chris Griffen's defunct website the Domain of Deneb.  The gravitics weapons and the Pretorian Guard CommandoWear from his website are now on the
<A HREF="./bard/bardvera.html">VERA</a> page. He had a sector write up for Old Expanses which is now on the
<A HREF="./bard/bardopal.html">OPAL</a> page.  Chris also started a campaign set in 1212 in Corridor sector; he wrote up a campaign sourcebook and details of Corridor sector.  These files are located in the
<a href="nis.html">Naval Intelligence Briefing Room</A>.
Dedly is posting most of the rest of the Domain of Deneb at his
<a href="http://members.aol.com/dedly/traveller/index.html">website</A>.
<P>
In addition to Chris Griffen's material I also recieved the Oriflamme Calvary Vehicle from Idiot/Savant and the 7cm L75 ETC Autocannon that is used in that vehicle and several other Oriflamme vehicles. I also received a write up of the Guild planet Jump From Patrice Lemire.  None of these items appeared on the TNE mailing list, so they should be new to most people.
<P>
Speaking of the TNE list, it has been quite active and the fruits of that activity appear mostly on the
<A HREF="./bard/bardvera.html">VERA</a> page.  There are over twenty new designs there. There is also a write up of the Auroran Defense Forces in the
<A HREF="./bard/bardopal.html">OPAL</a> section.

<P>I have also done some cleanup and touch up: I renumbered the entries in the
<A HREF="./bard/bardopal.html">OPAL</a> section, and linked the sectors to the sector listings.  I also cleaned up the links on the <A HREF="./bard/bardperi.html">PERI</a> page. In the <A HREF="./bard/bardvera.html">VERA</a> and
<A HREF="./bard/bardsara.html">SARA</a>sections I am trying to label the items with the planet of origin.  I am only partially through this.  I am trying to go through the VERA and SARA entries and make sure that they are all done with the same style.  I have noticed that some of the entries use a different table style, and I want to give everything a uniform look.
<P>
The results from the 8th Nebula contest are in and Nick Bradbeer's Rhino Hunter won, but I haven't written up the announcement or most of entries. Hopefully I'll get a chance to do it this week.<P>

<B>September 4th:</B> I didn't quite get it right yesterday when I said Idiot/Savant sent me new designs.  They were actually revised/corrected version of the other helicopters he had submitted before.  So I have replaced the
older versions with the new version.  He also did send along two new helicopters.  As he put it, "Most are the sort of thing adventurers are likely to use when their airraft breaks down, or else make good opposition in the
hands of TEDs."  <P>

<B>September 3rd:</B> I posted the announcement for the 8th Nebula Contest.  I added Colonel Cori Stern to the
<A HREF="./bard/barddani.html">DANI</a> section, a write up on Air/Space traffic control to the
<A HREF="./bard/bardgail.html">GAIL</a> section, a new company called Virusbusters to the
<A HREF="./bard/bardicis.html">ICIS</a> section,  a write up on the Guild world Jump to the
<A HREF="./bard/bardopal.html">OPAL</a> section, the <I>Fury</I> Battle Rider and its tender the <I>Nightlord</I> to the
<A HREF="./bard/bardsara.html">SARA</a> section and Oriflamme Light Assualt Armor and SmartPaint to the
<A HREF="./bard/bardvera.html">VERA</a> section.  Just as I was about to put this batch up, Idiot/Savant sent me several
new helicopter designs, which have been added to the <A HREF="./bard/bardvera.html">VERA</a> Section. I also added
a link to the Korinall Cluster webpage by Nick Bradbeer on the <A HREF="./bard/bardperi.html">PERI.</a>

<P>
<B>August 18th:</B> I posted the results of the 7th Nebula Contest<P>

<B>August 8th:</B> I posted the entries for the Pilot Nebula Contest. They are on the <A HREF="./bard/barddani.html">DANI</a> page in the Starship Crew section.  I also put up the <I>Fer-de-Lance</I> Escort Destroyer in the <A HREF="./bard/bardsara.html">SARA</a> section.
<P>
<B>July 7th:</B> I posted the three entries for the design an engineer Nebula Contest. They are in the <A HREF="./bard/barddani.html">DANI</a> section in the Starship Crew Section.  I also added two crew members that I had converted to HTML over a year ago, but didn't connect to the DANI page.<P>

<B>June 25th:</b> The rules for the <a href="nebula.html">6th Nebula Contest</A> are up. I finally got around to adding my write up on uplifted Jabberwocks to <A HREF="./bard/bardcari.html">CARI</a>
I added the Knights of St. George to  <A HREF="./bard/barddani.html">DANI</a>. I also added an example knight: Sir Rachelle Muller and an example Jabberwock: Crpl Rafton Clark. A write up for Oriflamme was added to the <A HREF="./bard/bardopal.html">OPAL</a>. I am also rearranging the OPAL section. Right now I have rearranged it, but I haven't changed any of the file numbers, so the numbers on the OPAL page do not match the actual file numbers.<P>

<B>June 19th:</B> As a change of pace I added rules for Vampires to the <A HREF="./bard/bardcari.html">CARI</a> section. They aren't really a minor race, but I didn't have anyplace better for them.  In the <A HREF="./bard/bardgail.html">GAIL</a> section I added several new skills by Harold Hale and an article about Imperial swords, many of which will be found in the Wilds and some will survive in the RC. In the <A HREF="./bard/bardhana.html">HANA</a> section I added several articles about the Solomani invasion of Alpha Crucis and the Old Expanses. The <A HREF="./bard/bardopal.html">OPAL</a>section got an article about RC monetary policy and write ups of Baldur/Old Expanses and Iiselu/Diaspora. In the <A HREF="./bard/bardsara.html">SARA</a> section I updated all the Hiver and Ithklur ships that TravlerTNE wrote up.  I also added the Extended Duration Survey Pod for the <I>Belladonna</I> Clipper. Finally the <A HREF="./bard/bardvera.html">VERA</a> section got three new planes, a pistol for SolSec agents and the <I>Gladiator Grav Tank</I>. Several of the articles I added were taken from emails on the TNE mailing list and were not written as articles originally. I thought they were interesting and I tried to put them in a format that fit the BARD pages.
<P>


<b>May 16th:</B> I just found a bunch of designs that were sent into the TNE mailing list, but I hadn't
added to the BARD pages so I have started converting them over. I added 14 Gauss Guns,  the GLRA-13 Grenade Launcher, the Hand
Cannon, the TL-5 Light Passenger/Cargo Plane, the Rannian Grav Tank and Grav Sled, the Solomani
GrPz-IV Grav Tank and the Rh 33 Mag Mass Driver for the GrPz-IV all to the <A HREF="./bard/bardvera.html">VERA</a> section.
I also added the Psionic Anagathics rules to the <A HREF="./bard/bardgail.html">GAIL</a> section, and the history of the
Battle of Ganesh and a view of the Collapse to the <A HREF="./bard/bardhana.html">HANA</a> section. The <A HREF="./bard/bardopal.html">OPAL</a> section got a write up of the physical
properites of the RC worlds.  I also fixed mistakes in
various writeups that I saw.  Well there is still a fair bit to convert over, but it will have to wait for a while.<P>


<b>May 7th:</B> I added the results from the 5th Nebula Contest, and the first batch of entries from the
Contest to the VERA Section. I also added the <I>Cyclops</I> Deep space probe, <I>Hell Hound</I> Security Bot and a write up of
high tech camping furniture to
<A HREF="./bard/bardvera.html">VERA</a>.  Places for several of the Nebula robots and several other robots were created,
but the write ups have not been finished yet.
I added Red Hoffmayer a murderous Oriflamme Technarch to the
<A HREF="./bard/barddani.html">DANI</a> section.  I also updated my version of the <I>Leviathan</I> Assualt Transport
to <A HREF="./bard/bardsara.html">SARA</a>. My previous
version was done with Thruster Plates and SSDS rules.
There are also a couple of new  CIN articles in CIN package 7 in the <A HREF="./bard/bardgail.html">GAIL</a>  section.
<P>

<B>April 2nd:</B> I added the <I>Belladona</I> Exploratory Clipper to the
<A HREF="./bard/bardsara.html">SARA</a>  section.  Patrice sent in New Era details of the worlds of the Khavle
Accordment a Hard Times era nation in Diaspora Sector.
These are in the <A HREF="./bard/bardopal.html">OPAL</a> section along with an alternative description
of Schotz in Sko Skire Subsector of the Old Expanses. There is also
a CIN article about Schotz in CIN package 7 in the <A HREF="./bard/bardgail.html">GAIL</a>  section.
In <A HREF="./bard/bardvera.html">VERA</a>  the Laser Blade, a solar powered Laser Pistol and self powered
Gauss weapons were added.
<P>

I was trying to revise the organization of some of the BARD pages
subpages. First
up is the VERA Page (focusing on equipment). Originally it only had two
divisions
equipment and vehicles.  I figured there needed to be more divisions so
I came
up with this tenative scheme.<P>
<uL>
<A HREF="http://www.mauigateway.net/~lewis/vera2.html">New Scheme</a>
</UL>
<P>

Let me know if there is anyway to improve on it. Tomorrow I'll be posting the entries to the Nebula Contest on Robots.<P>

<B>March 17th:</B> I haven't done anything to the BARD pages in a while
mainly because I haven't received anything to put up.  I did update
the address for the Confederation of Nightrim in the PERI pages. Derek
has updated and expanded these pages, so check them out.<P>
<B>Febuary 6th</B> I copied the Alpha Crucis world write ups that Idiot/Savant wrote up
for the 2.4 release of Galactic into the OPAL section.
I also posted the Transstar Board of Directors to the DANI section.  I
was also informed that the NIS pages were down, and I have fixed that
so they should be up now.  That's all for now.<P>
<b>January 28th</B> Idiot/Savant sent me a write up on The RCS <i>Angkor
Wat</I> one of the heroes of the New Era. It is available on the SARA
section for your viewing pleasure.<P>
<B>January 23rd</B>: Well it looks like I won't be updating thinsg quite
as often as before, but when I do I'll update alot.  Today I just
uploaded the Grey Ghost Fighter Wing to the DANI section, a write up of
Secret Weapons of the Rebellion to the HANA section, write ups of Schotz
in Old Expanses, Pesuuzu, Hatfield, and Six Gun to OPAL.  Eamon informed
me that I had some of the UPPs wrong in the Ring Pact worlds; hopefully
they are fixed now.  I added a write up of the failed Pocket Empire the
Alliance of Stars to teh PERI section.  The VERA section got a listing
of new materials, suitable for use in FFS. The SARA section got the most
additions, with updates of the Archangel SDB, Serpent SPB, Galahad
monitors and the ATEF SDB, Admiral Battle Rider, Fulton SDB, the
1000-class SDB, the Aries Patrol Cruiser and the Cleon Battle Tender.
Well that is about it for today. :) <P>

<b>December 20th:</b> Over the last week I have added quite a few new
pages.  I added the Triceratops fighter, the Haven mobile starport,
the Eyeball series of probes, the Hiver DD-IVb Destroyer and the Hiver
Tschudi battle rider to the
<a HREF="./bard/bardsara.html">SARA</a>  section.  I added two articles on
Solomani missiles, and conversions of the AN-94 and G11 assault rifles
to the <a HREF="./bard/bardvera.html">VERA</a>
section. To the <a HREF="./bard/bardopal.html">OPAL</a> section
I added a write up of the
Vampire fleet stationed in the Mitchell system, including the Dawn
League scout Helos.  There is also a short write up of the Enkidu boneyard.
Two representatives to the Assembly are in the <a HREF="./bard/barddani.html">DANI</a> section.
<P>
I found that there was a problem with the link from each web page to the
main BARD pages. I have fixed the problem with all but the VERA, OPAL and
SARA sections. Of course these pages have the most entries to change. :)
I'll fix them in the next week or so.

<P>

<B>December 9th:</b> Well I am finally moved into my new house, and I
have
had some time to start editing the BARD pages again.  First up is the
Ring Pact, a Pocket Empire in the Hinterworlds.  The description of the
Pact is in the PERI section, and the world write ups are in the OPAL
section.  I hope to once again begin periodic updates of the BARD pages,
and soon I'll post some Hiver ships.<P>
<b>October 16th</b> The pages were down for a while, as a Hacker
hit our site and took out our server. Also around the same time
we changed web servers and the new version of the software
didn't like how I did the referencing, but I fixed all of that
and everything should be working.  Pleas let me know if there is
anyting wrong.  <p>
You probably have noticed that nothing has been added to the Pages
in quite a while, that was becasue I was finishing up my Ph.D.
Well it is done know and I start a new job, so I should have
more free time.  Until I get an ISP, I don't know if I'll be
able to update the pages, but I'll be working on things at home, and
when I do get a chance to update things, expect a bunch of things
all at once.<p>

<b>August 2nd:</b> I added the Equalizer MMG to the VERA section.<p>
<b>August 1st:</b> I added several things today. I added the
20-mm Rotary Autocannon to
<a HREF="./bard/bardvera.html">VERA</a>. I added the <i>Eyeball</i>
series of probes to <a HREF="./bard/bardsara.html">SARA</a>.
The adventure Shadowbox, to <a HREF="./bard/bardmari.html">MARI</a>.
Jordan O'Brien, the Director of OBD, was added to <a HREF="./bard/barddani.html">DANI</a>,
while teh OBD was added to the Transstar section on the
<a HREF="./bard/bardicis.html">ICIS</a> page.<p>



<b>July 29th:</b> I actually put something up that was new! I
added the Saturn Class Military Transport to the SARA page.
Hopefully more new material will be forthcoming shortly. <p>

<b>July 16th:</b> E.D. Quibell pointed out that the link for the
TNE-RCES mailing list FAQ was incorrect, and I corrected that.
I am still working on my disseratation, and free time is in
small supply, soon I'll be done and wil update this pages. I promise!
<p>
<b>June 24th:</b> The BARD pages went down for a few days after
the hard drive where they were stored crashed. I brought back
a copy from the last backup tape. Since I haven't updated them
lately, there shouldn't be anything missing, but let me know
if there is.<p>

<b>April 30th:</b> I fixed up the Empire of Solee writeups that
I had messed up the other day.  These are in the PERI section.
So now all three of the pages are present.  I also
started converting the Ring Pact, the Hiver stepping stone
in the Hinterworlds.<p>

<b>April 28th:</b> I added two new corporations to ICIS, and
I added a Tactical circular on Grav belts to the
last CIN report.<p>

<b>April 17th:</b> I got the rest of the Nebula entries up.
I put Enrico Zaldus and Lt. Cmmdr. Ulianov on the DANI page,
but I put Isnardrin and DZ21Q on the MARI page, because it
seemed more like a one shot adventure than a repeatable NPC
encounter.<p>

<b>April 10th</b> I added two NPCs that were submitted to the Nebula
Contest, to the DANI page.<p>
<b>March 27th:</b> I added the Zaldus Corporation to the
<A HREF="./bard/bardicis.html">ICIS</a>, and I rearanged the
<A HREF="./bard/barddani.html">DANI</a> section.  Eventually
when I get some free time (HA!) I'll do a rearrange many of
the sections. Several of the pages have too many items
on one page, so I'll break it down into sub pages. For instnace
in the OPAL page, I'll have each of the subsections on a
separate page.

<p> I also added the Jgd-Il-Jagd to

<b>March 20th:</b> I added the  Thaggeshi, Answerin, Irhadre and
Cafadi to the <A HREF="./bard/bardcari.html">CARI</a> section on

convert to HTML, rather than tables like in starships. :)

the <A HREF="./bard/bardcari.html">CARI</a> section.

section I added the  <i>Hecate</i> SDB and its Jump Pod, the  <i>Lancer</i> and
 <i>Fusilier</i> Destroyers and the  <i>Vixen</i> and  <i>Amazonia</i> Scouts.

had these other ships sitting on my disk drive at home, and finally got a chance
to post them.<p>

 In the <A HREF="./bard/bardvera.html">VERA</a> section I added the
<i>Black Talon</i>, <i>Ranger</i> and <i>Paladin</i> Battledress, a 15-mm Autocannon and the
<i>Hornet</i> UCAV. I added a new bunch of CIN articles in
<A HREF="./bard/bardgail.html">GAIL</a>. These are all in
Package 8. I also added three new careers for the Confederation of Nightrim,
even those they are written for the Confederation of Nightrim, they are usable
in other settings. Personally I am going to use the Force Recon Marines in

SARA section.<p>

now be corrected.

These include the Nebula contest entries. Actually I forgot the Cross of Iron at home, but
I'll get that up tomorrow.  There are also several new SDBs and the Orrimot Logistics Ship.
<p>
<b>November 22nd:</b> Its been a while since I updated the BARD pages,
the main reason for this is that I have started writing my
Ph.D. dissertation.  I am keeping a copy of everything that I
get or see on the TNE-RCES mailing list, and it will eventually
make its way to the BARD pages.  Today I added two articles by
the late Eric Bould, covering Medals and Awards of the RC in the
<A HREF="./bard/bardgail.html">GAIL</a> section, and the Chruch Manichean from Baldur in the

Prospector's Buggy from <cite>Beltstrike</b>. It is in the
<A HREF="./bard/bardvera.html">VERA</a>.  While adding this, I noticed
that I had screwed up the previous three vehicles, so that they couldn't
be linked to, but I have fixed it.
<p>

<b>August 22th:</b> I posted the background for the
second <A HREF="nebula.html"><b>Nebula Design Contest</b></a>. This

a better place to put them, I have been putting them in

<p>
