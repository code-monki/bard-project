The first Nebula contest was to build a small merchant ship capable
of surviving in the Wilds. Six designs were received:<br>
<li> <A HREF="./bard/sara/sara7015.html"><i>Athenian</i> </a>Class Trader
                   by <A HREF="credits.html#Watters">Eamon Watters</a>

It looks like the next design contest will be to design a Regency Vampire Hunter ship.
It will probably start in the second week of August.

Here is a small intro paragraph to explain the story behind the Wilds
Trader.  I used the idea in Guilded Lilly of the RC buying old ships for new ones.
<p>

The RC has decided to institute a program of buying older highly worn
vessels from Free Traders, and replacing them with a new ship, which
can be maintained much easier and with Coalition supplied parts.
The benefits to the Coalition are that there will be a demand for
Coalition spare parts, the Free Traders will have to come to Coalition
space for repairs and annual maintenance.  The Free Traders will also
provide a means of communication between the Coalition and the Wilds.
This will start a base for further expansion of the RC. The RC will
also be able to salvage what ever remaining high tech parts these ships
have. It will also provide numerous jobs in the RC, and help spark
starport upgrades on worlds with only a B or C starport.  
<p>

The benefits to the Free Traders are that their ship will be much newer
and easier to maintain, there will be less down time, which will
increase profits.  They will have a steady supply of spare parts, as
opposed to the current situation of scrounging to find new parts at
every planet and starport.  While the Free Traders will have to come to
Coalition space to get the spare parts and maintenance, this will allow
them to purchase high tech merchandise that is unavailable in the Wilds,
further increasing profits. 
<p>

The RCSA feels that the standard Jayhawk Far Trader is unsuitable for
this task, for several reasons and is soliciting designs for a new Wilds
Trader.    The new ship can be built at any of the Coalition's shipyards,
at any associated Tech Level,  Jump Drives from Aubaine will have to be used  
and are available at the standard price.    At this time the RCSA
doesn't want to impose restrictions on the design of the ship.  It feels
that starship architects best know how to design ships, but it
encourages companies to interview Free Traders to get a feel for what
they want in a ship. 
<p>

The winning design, will be chosen by a panel of experts.  They will
judge the ship on affordability, survivability, profitability and general
usefulness.  Designs should be sent to the RCSA headquarters on Aubaine
by 14/VII/1202.  <p>
