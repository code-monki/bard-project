<B>September 29th, 2002</B> I didn't covert much this time, mainly because I was writing new material myself.  These include several RC military units: Shenandoah Snipers, RCES Khurguudir, and Marine Speeder Talon One.  Also added to the DANI pages were an example Sniper: "Blue Pearl", Solee Admiral Von Kessel, the Corvine Raiders, Church of the Chosen Ones, the Galanglic Thrice-Reformed Catholic Church, the Souk, Oysteroum Oytrip, and the Iron Butterflies. I converted Pete's Regency Wilds Overview, an article about creating religions in  Traveller, corporate write up of Black Dawn LLC. In the HANA section, there is an article about the rise and fall of the Solee Empire.   Richard Perk submitted a new adventure entitled, "CSB-11718".  In the OPAL section there are several new worlds in Diaspora subsector and an article about Jumpstart Caches in Corridor sector.
<P>

<B>August 11, 2002</B> A variety of new pages today.  I fixed up several mistakes in various pages.  The GAIL section has a list of the ships of the RQS and some new CIN articles. The HANA section, one of our less frequently updated pages, received an article about the Imperial Guard and one projection of the RC expansion into Khulum subsector. The MARI section has the third installment of Richard Perks' epic across the Old Expanses as well as Operation Nightingale.  The OPAL section has several worlds in the Solee hegemony as well as several dead worlds in Diaspora. The SARA section has more ships by Peter Grey.  I am still concentrating on ships that PCs would be more likely to encounter.  The million ton dreadnaughts are still to come.  The DANI section has a write up of the Galanagic Catholic Church.<P>



<B>June 8, 2002</B> I concentrated on starships this update.  Since I have so many starships backlogged, I concentrated on ships that would be most useful for campaigns.  This included merchant ships, scout ships and other unique craft.  The mega-dreadnaughts will have to wait a while.  I think the next set of ships will focus on fighters.  In addition to starships, In the OPAL section, I have uploaded Dunmag in Deneb sector, system defense forces for Kruyter and Oriflamme in the Reformation Coalition.   In a rare addition to the ICIS section, I added Jumping-Jack-Flash-Interstellar Salvage & Mercantile, Ltd.  The VERA section received three Submachine guns and several vehicles from Derek Stanley's Nightrim campaign. <P>

<B>May 12, 2002</B> I think I have finished off Pete Gray's writeups for Deneb.  If I find any missing worlds, I'll update them.  I added a write up of Welzer, in the Old Expanses. I concentrated on starships this time, converting all of the Antony Farrell's Solomani Confederation ships as well as two Solomani ships by Pete Gray.  I renamed the four Oriflamme ships to better reflect the naming scheme in RCEG. I also added the MARTI tracked vehicle to the VERA section.  Finally I added the Rose Brotherhood to the DANI section.  A short update, but at least its less than a month since the last update.
<P>
<B>April 18, 2002</B>     I have finished uploading the various entries into the Call to Arms contest, these can all be found on the <A HREF="./bard/bardsara.html">SARA</A> page.  Also there is the Type 1062 Landing Boat and the Aganar Light Cruiser. The <a HREF="./bard/bardgail.html">GAIL</A> section received write ups of Project Valhalla, the Regency Fleet list and part two of the Deneb Last Lexicon.  The CIN section received numerous updates from Liam Devlin.  The <A HREF="./bard/bardmari.html">MARI</A> section received the first two parts (A Walk in the Park and the Eye of the Beast) of a epic adventure across the Old Expanses.   The <A HREF="./bard/bardopal.html">OPAL</a> section once again received the most updates, most of these are Pete Gray's write ups for Deneb.  I thought I had finished them off, but I found an email about the Unusual Worlds of Deneb.  They will be up next time.  Also included are several write ups in Old Expanses, by Richard Perks, the author of the adventures mentioned above and by Liam Devlin.
 I have a huge backlog of stuff to convert, especially ships with the fleet Call to Arms contest.  It will take a while to get them all up.
<P>
<B>February 22, 2002</B> Once again its been a while since the last update.  This time we have worlds in Deneb sector by Pete Gray and  worlds in Old Expanses by Richard Perks. In the <A HREF="./bard/bardvera.html">VERA</a> section several vehicles were added along with two cannons. Pete Gray started a "Call to Arms" Competition for starship design.  The <I>Salamander</I> Gunship is on the <A HREF="./bard/bardsara.html">SARA</A> page along with several assualt shuttles and the n Pihbhebaldelyo Patrol Cruiser .  More entries will follow.  Finally the <A HREF="./bard/barddani.html">DANI</A> got several new NPCs by Alvin Plummer in the Regency section, while Matti O'Conner was added to the Neutral Parties section.  In other news, Paul Walker the original creator of the BARD pages has returned to Traveller and will help convert some of the backlog of submissions to HTML.
<P>

<B>July 26th</B> Pete Gray continues to produce world write ups.  Most of the new worlds are in Deneb, but there are two new Trojan Reaches worlds.  Pete is not the only one writing worlds.  Richard Perks submitted a write up of the Edge and I wrote up Exage; both are in the Old Expanses. In addition to the new worlds, I reorganized the <A HREF="./bard/bardopal.html">OPAL</a> section.  Now each sector is a separate page. I think this will make it easier to navigate.<P>

In the <A HREF="./bard/bardvera.html">VERA</a> section there are several new civilian automobiles and an interdiction satellite.  The <A HREF="./bard/bardsara.html">SARA</A> page has the <I>Star</I> Armoured Merchant,   Imperial <I>Leviathan</I> Merchant Cruiser,  Oberlindes Cargo Carrier and the <I>Furlong</I> Fleet Courier.
<P>

<B>July 9th</B> Its another big update.  I believe I have finished off all the material Pete Gray has sent into the mailing list.  This includes a number of worlds in the Trojan Reaches, the UWP updates for Spinward Marches, Troy and the Reft.  There is also his stats for Foreven in <A HREF="./bard/bardopal.html">OPAL</a> and various library data entries in
<A HREF="./bard/bardgail.html">GAIL</a>.  Also in <A HREF="./bard/bardgail.html">GAIL</a> is a chart of habitable temperature zones for planets.  In the <A HREF="./bard/bardvera.html">VERA</a> section there are several updates to vehicles that Pete wrote and a fusion pistol by Antti.  <A HREF="./bard/bardsara.html">SARA</A> has corrections to the <I>Gargoyle</I> Battle Rider and the <I>Zdebr</I> Freighter.  In the <a HREF="./bard/barddani.html">DANI</A> section there is a write up of the Vargr Pack, and D'Yan, an insane Vargr in the Neutral Party section.  I created a Regency NPC section and I have started to convert several NPCs that Alvin Plummer submitted to the TML many years ago.  I also moved the NPCs from the NIS page, and in fact the NIS page has been totally merged with the BARD pages and it no longer exists.  Finally I updated the web page about the mailing list to give directions for the new mailing list.
<P>

<B>June 26th</B> As you can see, its been quite a while since the last update.  I guess I took a break from Traveller, but I am back in the swing of things now.  Once again Pete Grey contributed many of the new pages.  He wrote up worlds in Deneb, Foreven, Reft, and the  Trojan Reaches.  Dedly posted a world in Corridor and another in the Riftspan Reaches.   A lost file from the Manifest destiny campaign surfaced and it provides 1212 UWPs for Deneb. Pete also wrote up several smaller worlds in the Spinward Marches, ideally they each would have their own page, but in order to get everything converted I put them all on the same page. These all appear in the <A HREF="./bard/bardopal.html">OPAL</a> Section.
<P>
In the <A HREF="./bard/bardvera.html">VERA</a> Section there are many new vehicles, including the first wet navy vessel, the first blimp and several hovercraft.  Along with several library data write ups for the Regency by Pete, there are also rules for wet navy vessels and new psionic skills  in the <A HREF="./bard/bardgail.html">GAIL</a> section.  The <A HREF="./bard/bardsara.html">SARA</A> section has many new starships including many Zhodani and Aslan ships.  The <a HREF="./bard/bardcari.html">CARI</A> section has TNE conversions of the Bwaps and the Githiaskio along with a listing of the Zhodani Fleet in the Spinward area of the Imperium.
<P>
Still left to convert is the rest of Foreven Sector UWPs, Pete's explanation for UWP changes in the Regency and some weapons.  I will probably get rid of the NIS page and consolidate everything on the BARD pages.  This will mean adding Regency NPCs to DANI, and I have an entire file of NPCs that I never converted.

<P>

<B>January 29th</B>  Another update and Pete Grey still dominates the new writeups.  There are almost 80 new writeups.
Most of them are planets set in Foreven, Spinward Marches and the Trojan Reaches, as always they are in the <A HREF="./bard/bardopal.html">OPAL</a> Section.  There is also a write up of the worlds of
the Sitah Region in the Old Expanses by yours truly.  In addition Pete Grey has spewed out a number of Aslan and other ships in the <A HREF="./bard/bardsara.html">SARA</a> section.  There is also the <I>Pellew</I> Corvette and a new version of the <I>Manzikert</I> Destroyer, I had mistakenly deleted the old version.
