Originally the Nebula contests were simply design contests, but we have branched out to NPCs. The last contest was a hard core gearhead contest.  There is currently no contest in progress.  If you have a suggestion for one, just email me.<P>

<h3>Contest Rules</h3>

<li>Submissions should be sent to me by November 1st. Then I'll send  it out to the list and people will have a week to vote.

<li>The votes should be based on which is your favorite submission.

<LI> Voting will be done by the members of the TNE mailing lists.
(I guess if anyone else sends in a ballot I'll count that too.<p>

<li> Submissions should be sent to me in ASCII format. I can handle other formats, but
its too much work.

<li> If you have any questions or suggestions for future contests drop me a message.
