	<UL>  Governor Justin Muurgan Muurgan  was elected Governor  of <A HREF="lewis.html">Lewis</A>,by the  settlers that reside there.  For further information onthe Governor's history see the RICE Paper  on the planet Lewis.<BR><BR>Governor Muurgan is 105 years old.  Even though he is ancient,his body is in rather good condition.  He prides himself on walking two miles everyday.  He does this even when travelling on astarship.  This often annoys the crew, as he tends to like tostroll around engineering bays.  He has a closely cropped  thinning white hair, and a very dark complexion.<BR><BR>The Governor is often travelling to meet with supporters, or togather more supporters.  He meets with  small groups of people,here and there.  He only addresses large crowds, on those worldswhere  the  cause  of Lewis is a popular one.  On these worlds heoften attends fundraisers, and other gala events.  He is ofteninvited to parties where he is a minor celebrity.<BR><BR>The Governor is a driven by the idea of freedom for his people.He will do  almost anything to get them free. He realizes thatmost of the people who invite him to parties, or come to hisspeeches, are more interested in his celebrity than his cause.But if they donate money, they help the cause, even if theydon't believe in it as much as he does.<p>
