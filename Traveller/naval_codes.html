This is an updated version of the old High Guard
system of ship classification.  The Regency Navy
overhauled the old system in 1176 as part of its
reorganisation, simplifying the codes to eliminate
confusion, and in most cases assigning a single class
to each code. As in old Imperial practice, the first
class code denotes primary membership, modified by an
optional qualifier.

<P>
Current practice on codes "armored" and "gunned" is
for their application to merchant ships or auxiliaries
serving with the RN or RQS.  These codes are no longer
applied to military line ships, as they are
superfluous and unneeded.  The qualifier "Imperial",
while still present on some older classes, was no
longer applied after 1176, and only classes built
before the Collapse are entitled to bear it anymore.
Non-Assigned qualifiers are intended for future use.
"Heavy" and "Imperial" have been replaced with the
terms "Hunter" and "Intruder" following the 1169 White
Paper on Regency naval strategies.
<P>
Small craft codes are special and are handled under a
"parenthetical" method.
<P>
Regency Naval Definitions:  The Regency Navy
recognises four categories around which it organises
its forces.  These four categories are: Combat, Combat
Support, Logistical Support and Military Spacelift.
Each category is further broken down into seperate
subcategories reflecting specific roles in the
overriding main category. And those subcategories are
lastly divided into different rates, and the rates
into classes.
<P>
The Combat category is divided into four
subcategories: Hunter, Intruder, Protector and Scout.
These are not firm Solomonic divisions, but merely
design objectives built within a ship.  There is
considerable overlap, particularly between the Hunter
and Intruder roles.
<P>
1. Hunter: refers to ships that fill both the
strategic defense role. Hunters are usually designed
to protect against Intruders, deflecting or destroying
encroaching enemy fleets away from bases and vital
internal worlds.
<P>
In Regency service, ships with the term "Hunter" as a
qualifier usually mount the heaviest armor possible,
the largest spinal mount or spinal rosette possible,
and have a jump range of 3-4.
<P>
2. Intruder: Ships designed for the strategic offense
role, specifically the seizure or destruction of enemy
bases and worlds.
<P>
In Regency service, ships with the term "Intruder" as
a qualifier usually  mount a number of parallel
mounts, carry considerable supporting small craft, and
have a jump range of 4-5.
<P>
3. Protector: Ships designed for the tactical and
operational defensive roles.  These are ships designed
and tasked to protect space commerce, and to protect
specific tactical or strategic supporting facilities
within a system or base.
<P>
Protectors are limited to rates D through G, have a
jump range of 3-4, optional spinal mounts, and some
limited form of offensive ability.
<P>
4. Scouts. Also known as the Scout/Screen role. These
ships are information gatherers or contact units
tasked to provide early warning and continuing
realtime intel to the Main Battle Fleet (MBF).
<P>
Scouts are limited to rates D through G and S, and
must have minimum 3G and J-2.
<P>
Regency Combat Classes and Rates:  Regency designation
of naval craft are divided according to their combat
role, and further subdivided by subcategories or
chronological order.  The TL of the vessel is adjoined
to this, and finally a letter denoting the numerical
progression of that class and rate. For example a
BB-13C is a Battleship, TL13, and the third class of
such ship in active duty at that TL recognised by the
Regency/Imperium. Note emphasis on "active duty",
which means that ships are often reclassified as other
vessels are decommissioned or transferred. The code
(PC) is used to indicate a post-collapse design.
<P>
Please note: This system of classification applies
only to the Regency Space Forces, not to Regency
Planetary or Subsector Navys, which often have their
own overlapping or non-standard classifications, often
confusing and contradictory. These codes also do not
apply to the navies of surrounding Spinward States,
though a few, notably the Corellian League, the
Protectorate and the Avalar Consulate, use a close
facsimile of this system.
<P>
A: SUPERHEAVY SHIPS.  Craft that exceed battleship
displacement craft.  Mostly experimental or limited
production.
<P>
AH, AI- Leviathan. 2,000,000+ tons. The
"superbattleship" idea brought back to life.  The
advent of icing technology allowed the Regency to
build a limited number of these ships beginning in the
1160s, and most are limited, because of their expense,
to experimental roles and defending the Regency
national and sector capitols.
<P>
AV, AT- "Behemoth". Unknown ship class described in
the RASAC archives leaked in 1201. Apparently a
massive tender or carrier class vessel with combining
frontline battle ability with carried escort and
screening ships. It is unknown why this vessel was in
the RASAC files, but there is rampant speculation that
the navy was looking into the possibility of using
Puppeteer strain Viruses similar to the Khishki's to
man a small task force sized naval unit.
<P>
B. BATTLESHIPS: Defined as the heaviest primary
combatant in the battleline.
<P>
BB- Battleship. 150,000-1,000,000 tons.  The Regency
retains the Imperial practice of classing reserve and
lower tech dreadnoughts as BBs.
<P>
BC- Battlecruiser. 100,000-250,000 tons.  Replaces the
code BL (Light Battleship), a reflection of the short
lifespan of these ships in traditional battleship
roles. BCs are the most common Regency battleship
rate, making up approximately 40 percent of all
battleships "afloat".
<P>
BH,BI- Dreadnought. 700,000-2,000,000 tons. BI
(Imperial Battleship) was replaced with Battleship
Intruder, while BH (Heavy Battleship) was replaced
with Battleship Hunter. Originally the Imperium rated
ships above 3Gs as BI, and those below as BH.  All
classes built since 1133 are above 3Gs and are now
classed purely as BH or BI depending upon their
primary armament and jump range, which creates no
small amount of confusion, even with the new system,
and are termed (PC).
<P>
C. CRUISERS: Most common heavy battleline, raiding and
escort unit.
<P>
CC, CF- Fleet Cruiser. 30,000-80,000 tons. Primary
cruiser classes.
<P>
CH, CI- Heavy Cruiser. 80,000-150,000 tons.  See
"Dreadnought" above for details, as the same situation
applies. Min Jump 3.
<P>
CL- Light Cruiser. 15,000-30,000 tons.
<P>
CR- Raiding Cruiser. 10,000-150,000 tons.  Currently a
disused category.  The last CR, the CR-15B, was
rerated as the CP-15E in 1181.
<P>
CS: Strike Cruiser. 25,000-75,000 tons. Min Jump 4.
<P>
CT: Assualt Cruiser. Craft purpose built for Marine
SaultRons. Current classes are the CT-15A (Al-Khafji
class) and CT-15B(PC) (Garrison Class).
<P>
D. DESTROYERS: Main raiding and screening units, and
most common line units.
<P>
DD, DF: Fleet Destroyer. 8,000 to 20,000 tons.  Most
common fleet line rate.  Min J-3, 4-G.
<P>
DH, DI: Heavy Destroyer, Destroyer Hunter/Intruder.
20,000 to 35,000 tons. Min Jump 3, 4-G.

DM: Missle Destroyer: Any destroyer that mounts
missles as its primary armament.  Currently a disused
category in Regency service.

DR: Raiding Destroyer. 10,000 to 20,000 tons. Min 4-G.
Classes recognised: DR-15A (Mandragora Class), DR-15B
(Beltane Class).
<P>
DS: Strike Destroyer. 5,000 to 15,000 tons. Min Jump
4.
Spinal Mount required.  The Manzikert (DS-15B) is a
good example of this class.
<P>
E. ESCORTS: Ships assigned to the Protector role, and
designed to protect shipping and vital facilities
against enemy raiders.  Generally more than 3-G, and
min jump 2.  Many are former line ships rerated and
modified.
<P>
EB: Battle Escort. Large 20,000+ ton escorts, usually
mercantile cruisers assigned to the Ready Reserve
during peacetime, that have a dual military-civil
capacity.  Most EBs continue their dual role in
wartime, often acting as the main central defenders of
a convoy in case of an attack.
<P>
EC: Close Escort. Small, 1,000 to 3,000 ton hulls
designed to blend in with escorted ships and convoys.
The Chrysanthemum was rerated as the EC-15C in 1176.
<P>
ED: Destroyer Escort.  The most common pre-collapse
escort rate.  5,000 to 10,000 tons displacement.
<P>
EE: Generic Escort. Rate is rarely used.
<P>
EF: Fleet Escort. 10,000 to 20,000 tons. Often
obsolescent cruisers and destroyers given new
armaments and powerplants and downgraded to escort
roles.  A good, if oversizd, example of this is the
former Azhanti High Lightning Intruder Class (IF-14A)
which is currently the EF-15D.
<P>
EL: Light Escort. 800 to 2000 tons.  Fast and long
ranged. Examples of this class include the Mosquito-E
and the original Fer-De-Lance classes.
<P>
EN: Special Escort.  This solely refers to the
venerable Tekkatir class escort.  The Tekkatir was
designed specifically to escort and support Imperial
special forces and Ranger units.  Most of these
vessels are assigned to the joint Special Operations
Command.
<P>
F. FRIGATES: Frigates partially fulfill the
Screener/Scout role identified in the 1169 White
Paper. Along with Escorts, Gunboats and Scouts,
Frigates form the vanguard of the MBF, providing
intelligence, and diverting or otherwise occupying
enemy scouting and perimeter vessels.  While rarely
equipped with spinal mounts, most frigates are 5-G and
up, are heavily armed with unmanned laser turrets and
barbettes, and are beginning to mount more and more
small craft and RPVs to support their roles.
<P>
FF: Fleet Frigate.
<P>
FH, FI: Battle Frigate. A destroyer or light cruiser
modified for the Vanguard role.
<P>
FL: Light Frigate. This class includes the variant
Mosquito-F.
<P>
FM: Missle Frigate. Frigates are more likely to be
involved in close quarter delaying and contact
battles, where missles really come in their own.  FMs
include the Yataghan (FM-15E) class. All members of
this classification rely upon missles for their
primary armament.
<P>
FP: Patrol Frigate.  This class includes the 400 ton
Lauritson class (FP-15A).
<P>
FS: Strike Frigate. Frigate class intended for deep
penetration strike raids and commerce raiding. 1500 to
5000 tons displacement, min. J-4.
<P>

G. GUNSHIPS: Light battle or security ships of less
than 3000 tons displacement.  never intended to be in
MBF actions.  Usually used for the Security/Screening
and light Escort roles.
<P>
(Author's note: I know that, in order to suspend
disbelief, and create the impetus for really cool
running space battles, as well as make military craft
accessible to players, the powers that be decided to
populate the Traveller universe with these kinds of
craft. In actuality, small warships like these will be
uncommon within line service.  Or used as a utility
craft aboard a much larger warship, kind of like being
an armed cutter or lifeboat.)
<P>
GF: Fleet Gunship. 300 to 1000 tons.
<P>
GG: Heavy Gunship. Gunboat of 1000+ to 3000 tons
displacement.
<P>
GL: Corvette. The Corvette, like the Sloop below, is
designed for multiple roles. These include policing,
rescue, piracy supression and Quarantine enforcement.
Unlike sloops, the Corvette's emphasis is on space
roles, and firepower projection, which is why few of
them possess ancillary small craft.  Includes the
Valor (GL-15A) missle corvette.
<P>
GP: Patrol Gunship. This class includes the classic
Patrol Cruiser (PG-15A) and the new Barekdoldin class
(PG-16A).  Commonly known in Regency service as "Pig
Boats." This group also includes the new Praetorian
"pursuit cruiser", a high-g TL15 updating of the
Gazelle Escort.
<P>
GS: Sloop.  Small escort or intruder vessel designed
for multiple roles. The Fiery (GS-14C), her TL16
daughter the Luminous Class, the Faith class cutter
(GS-15B), and the Gazelle (GS-14B) are rated as
Sloops.
<P>
GU: Multiuse Gunship.  Small gunship designed to
carried by a larger craft, acting as a large landing
craft, utility shuttle, boarding craft or BVR (Beyond
Visual Range) targeting and relaying.  Most are 100 to
400 tons displacement, and are usually carried aboard
rate A through D craft.
<P>
H. ASSAULT SHIPS: Craft designed for the carriage,
delivery and support of ground or ships troops to an
objective.  Most H class ships are from 400 to 25,000
tons, able to deploy a large force of troops on an
unprepared surface or water, or grapple and remain
attached to any existing spacecraft.
<P>
HA: Armored Assualt. 400 to 2000 tons displacement.
JDs are not required.  HA's are boarding assualt
ships, designed to pursue, overtake and grapple with
another ships.  Rare in Antebellum times, these craft
have an important role in an age of Viral infected
spacecraft. Most of these ships are armored to take a
point blank hit from 450 MJ unmanned laser barbettes.
<P>
HB: Battle Assualt.  These are usually first wave
assualt ships designed for the dropping of assualt
infantry and Marine Units. Their emphasis is on
support of infantry units, and have a large small
craft stable. Few are more than 10,000 tons
displacement.
<P>
HT: Assualt Transport. The large assualt ships
designed to directly land a taskforce on a planet.
Can carry, at minimum, a reinforced armored infantry
battalion and its supporting elements.  Older HTs are
often rerated as Ro-Ros in strategic spacelift roles.
<P>
S. SCOUTS. Craft designed specifically for the
Scouting/Screening role. Range from the traditional
Suleiman class Scout, to large Scout Cruisers.
<P>
SC: Scout Cruisers. Large, 5000+ ton ships designed
for force recon, or support of intel gathering
operations. Many are capable of directly carrying
smaller scout ships, SOF shipping and remote drone
vessels.  Many are equipped with spinal mounts.
<P>
SF: Fleet Scout. A scout ship attached to primary MBF.
Usually 800 to 2000 tons displacement.
<P>
SJ: Fast Scout. A scout ship of 4G+ performance.
<P>
SK: Scout Courier. A scout ship designed for light
scouting and communication relay duties. Includes the
classic Suleiman (SK-15) class.
<P>
SS: Strike Scout. Scout ship designed for TD and SOF
operations.
<P>
T. TENDERS. Though technically not a line unit, the
tender's carried strike force gives it its offensive
punch, and is an indespensable part of its assigned
task force.  A tender is any ship that carries more
than two vessels of more than 100 tons displacement.
Most Tenders and their Riders are currently deployed
in the Hunter role, often to interdict strategic gas
giants in or near the Regency frontier to stem
unauthorised refueling, or to ambush Vampire fleets.
<P>
TB: Battle Tender. Minimum 100,000 tons displacement.
Ship designed to carry line ships in excess of 10,000
tons displacement.  Most Regency ships have a minimum
J-4, 200,000 to 400,000 tons displacement, and carry 3
to 5 20,000 to 30,000 ton Battle Riders.
<P>
TS: Strike Tender. Smaller (<100,000 Tons) ship
designed to carry smaller 500 to 10,000 ton riders
into battle. Most common Tender in the Marches prior
to the Fifth Frontier War.  Unlike TB, TS is often
designed to act in support of its carried task force.
<P>
V. CARRIERS. Military craft designed to carry, support
armed small craft that constitute a major part of its
function and firepower.  Since this definition covers
a good deal of ground, it includes so called
"demi-carriers", cruisers and destroyers converted to
carrying a large number of fighters and small SDBs.
Most carriers, unlike Tenders above, carry substantial
firepower and armor for self-defense.
<P>
VC: Cruiser Carrier. Cruiser converted to carry a
large force of small craft. This includes many older
Azhanti High Lightning class ships.
<P>
VD: Destroyer Carrier. Also known as a Pocket or
Demi-Carrier. A 5000+ ton destroyer converted to
carrying several fighters.
<P>
VF: Fleet Carrier. Carrier of more than 100,000 tons.
<P>
VS: Strike Carrier. Carrier of less than 100,000 tons.
Both the VF and VS have been downgraded since the
Regency has adopted the Zhodani method of building
smaller multipurpose carriers based upon cruiser and
destroyer hulls.<P>
