<UL><B>Notes:</B>
Hans has been written up in Traveller:The New Era stats, but can be used
in any era.  He has been enhanced by unknown means, and can see in the dark. 
Treat this as IR vision.  He his skin has armor value 1, even though it
appears like perfectly normal human skin.<BR><BR>

<UL><B>History:</B> 
Who am I? The name on my ID says Hans Pritcher. The face matches mine.
I have no memories except in my nightmares.  In them it is very cold and 
there is no gravity. Each one reveals more of my identity. Even though they
terrorize me, I find myself wanting them so that I can end this wakeful death.
When I am awake all I know are two names and faces. Bj Eyzaguirre and Ammel 
Brodrig.  The first to deliver a message to, the second to kill. Of course I
can't remember what the message is. <BR><BR>

I know that I am somehow enhanced. I can see in the dark, others can not.
I have been unscathed by bullets that penetrate others. I know that I am 
somehow more/less than human.  I feel nothing except in the flashbacks. <BR><BR>

Pritcher is an enigma even to himself.  He thinks he might be some sort of
artifical construct, android, cyborg, or bio-construct he doesn't know, and 
deep down he doesn't really want to know.  While he tries to figure out the
question of his existance, he has taken up a job working as a corporate trouble
shooter. With the emphasis on shooting.  After killing a man on the job, he relized
that he had killed before, and fairly often. Another piece of the puzzle.  <BR><BR>

<UL><B>Appearence:</B>
Pritcher is of average height and build. He has dark hair, and he wears it
slicked back. His face hardly ever shows any emotion, and he often wears
sunglasses to hide what he is looking at. He tends to wear long coats, to
better hide the numerous handguns he tends to carry. <BR><BR>
