--- Administrative commands for the tne-rces list ---

I can handle administrative requests automatically. Please
DO NOT SEND THEM TO THE LIST ADDRESS! If you do, I will not
see them and other subscribers will be annoyed. Instead, send
your message to the correct command address:

   <tne-rces-subscribe@tower.ml.org>

   <tne-rces-unsubscribe@tower.ml.org>

Send mail to the following for info and FAQ for this list:

Similar addresses exist for the digest list:

To get messages 123 through 145 (a maximum of 100 per request), mail:
   <tne-rces-get.123_145@tower.ml.org>

To receive all messages with the same subject as message 12345,
send an empty message to:
   <tne-rces-thread.12345@tower.ml.org>

The messages do not really need to be empty, but I will ignore
their content. Only the ADDRESS you send to is important.

You can start a subscription for an alternate address,
for example "john@host.domain", just add a hyphen and your
address (with '=' instead of '@') after the command word:
<tne-rces-subscribe-john=host.domain@tower.ml.org>

To stop subscription for this address, mail:
<tne-rces-unsubscribe-john=host.domain@tower.ml.org>

In both cases, I'll send a confirmation message to that address. When
you receive it, simply reply to it to complete your subscription.

If despite following these instructions, you do not get the
desired results, please contact my owner at
tne-rces-owner@tower.ml.org. Please be patient, my owner is a
lot slower than I am ;-)
