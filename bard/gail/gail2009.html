<h1>Deneb Library Data: Wildside</h1>

<P>
The following library data covers the Regency's
coreward Deneb Frontier, from Pretoria to coreward
Namidshur. It includes historical data concerning the
end of the Civil War period, the war of the
Quarantine, and life on several Frontier worlds.
<P>
<B>Ashes, Battle of:</B>  Last futile military campaign by
the Assemblage of 1116, that took place in 1133-1135.
The bloody standoff between the Domain of Deneb and
the Assemblage had left Deneb's coreward subsectors
shattered, and by the time of the Collapse an uneasy
stalemate prevailed between the two warring sides.
Through emissaries, Norris secured a ceasefire in 1131
that temporarily ended the fighting and permitting a
reshuffling of fleet elements to trailing. The
following year the new Regency ceded occupied worlds
to their Vargr warlords, and incorporated them into
its protective custody.  Intimidated by the bold
Regency actions but happy with the recognition of
their claims, several corsair lords transferred their
allegiance, even if reluctantly, from the Assemblage
to the Regency.
<P>
Assemblage leader Arruna Kosghaele Zal acquiesced to
these developments publicly, but inwardly refused to
accept the frustration of his ambitions. Zal quietly
mustered as many military and corsair units he could
afford, and assembled them into a fleet at
Ongon/Dhukhaegz (Tuglikki 0737) in 1133. The fleet
entered the Regency at El D'Nah/Pretoria (Deneb 0502)
and quickly overpowered the light RQS contingent
guarding the system. The fleet then made its way down
the Borderline, overrunning the Regency naval base at
Kirklend/Pretoria. Most 61st Fleet units in the region
had been drawn away by the Abandonment further to
trailing, and the remaining squadrons, while
technologically superior, were vastly outnumbered.
Zal's forces paused briefly at Kirklend, sending out
light raider units throughout Pretoria and Lamas to
disrupt communications. His strategy was to soften up
the 194th Fleet by scattering its units in pursuit of
these light units, and then charging into the
subsector at the head of his heavy units.
Unfortunately for Zal, notice of the tragic results of
the Sword World Landgrab did not reach him in time.
Instead his heavy units waited at Kirklend throughout
1134 while the Regency mustered reinforcements at
Pretoria. In 1135 Zal and his troops finally moved
down towards the Safe, only to be intercepted by these
reinforcements at Ash (Deneb 0504). In the resulting
battle the disbelieving Zal refused to acknowledge
that he had miscalculated, and committed to a battle
that destroyed nearly ninety percent of his forces.
Zal and his three eldest children were killed in the
subsequent melee.  The remainder of the Assemblage
fleet attempted another invasion of the Regency later
in the year, this time through Lamas Subsector, but
were crushed for good at Lome (Deneb 1306).
<P>
While the outcome of the battle was never in doubt
after Zal's failure to exploit his earlier gains, the
victory was an important morale booster for the
fledgling Regency forces, and were immortalised as the
the Battle of Ashes. Zal himself has become an
Ozymandias-like figure in Regency media and historical
depiction, a despot who wagered the fate of his entire
nation on a single bet, and lost everything. After the
Battle of Ashes, surviving Vargr states reaffirmed
their loyalty to the Spinward States Accords, and
subsequently corsair raiding of the Regency almost
ceased entirely.
<P>
<B>Assemblage of 1116:</B> Oppurtunistic state founded in
1116 upon recieving notification of Strephon's
assassination. The state was founded by the popular
dictator of Ngorsraek (Tuglikki 1937), Arruna
Kosghaele Zal. Through not able to defeat the Domain
of Deneb fleet en masse, a joint mustering of
independent corsairs and planetary navies inflicted
major damage upon many Denebian worlds in subsectors
adjacent to the Assemblage, and caused major
evacuations even before the arrival of Virus.  The
worst of this damage came in the coreward extents of
Lamas and Pretoria subsectors, and many of the
casualties were civilians killed in raids on commerce
and ground installations.
<P>
So great was the hatred of Regency citizens and local
military cadres for the Assemblage, that in the wake
of the Battle of Ashes no surrender of any Assemblage
affiliated units was ever accepted. Instead nearly
every unit that attempted encountered was massacred,
with no special distinction made between legitimate
units or corsairs. Many Assemblage civilians were also
massacred by enraged planetary militias on worlds
where Vargr forces did not have an advantage or
control.
<P>
A significant portion of the Assemblage's forces
already present in the DoD's outer marches managed to
stave off further assualts, and regrouped surviving
stragglers. So poisonous is the relationship between
locals and these holdouts that the Regency must manage
strong naval patrols in coreward Deneb for the purpose
of buffering the two communities.  Information coming
through Gehenna has indicated that several worlds in
the former Assemblage are on the verge of making a
recovery from Virus, and this has further inflamed
tensions in the coreward Frontier.
<P>
<B>Borlund Abandonment:</B> The massive demographic collapse
of Borlund/Lamas (Deneb 1406) in the wake of the
Abandonment.  Borlund's high population was the result
of insane Imperial development policies that turned
this marginal world into a major manufacturer of
Pre-Stellar level goods for export into the Vargr
Extents. With the release of Virus, and the prior
demise of its markets due to Vargr raiding, the world
had become a major liability to the Regency, who
placed it into the Frontier. Between 1132 and the
present, Borelund has lost some 50 billion of its
people. Only half of this number has been due to
offworld emigration, as the movement of so many people
was simply impossible even with the utilization of
troop transports.
<P>
Instead the world's younger citizens were induced to
emigrate by the planetary government and their elders,
leaving behind an aging population that has diminished
through natural death. Borlund is now a world of
graying elderly people, supported largely by the
remittances they recieve from their descendants living
elsewhere in the Regency. The local industries have
largely ground to a halt, and most jobs are filled
either by simple automation systems, virus resistant
robots, or by offworld guest workers, many of whom are
Vargr immigrants. The presence of the latter
necessitates a major RQS contingent as a deterrence to
Pack activities on this vulnerable world.  Borlund is
generally not thought of by people in the Safe as a
world worth visiting, a sad casualty of necessity.
<P>
<B>Countinghouse:</B> High security storage facility located
in a cave complex on Karst/Namidshur (Deneb 1814). It
is located  offshore in an old salt mine, and its
location makes it nearly inaccessible to the surface.
The facility is owned by the Karst government, and run
by a public corporation. The extent and layout of the
facility are classified, but it is rumored to be
extremely large. Nearly everything imaginable has been
stored in its depths at one time or another. The
facility administrators do not discriminate between
its customers, and its clientele ranges from the
Regency government storing important documents to
retirees hoping to preserve family heirlooms. A nearby
private C-class starport is the sole means of outside
access, as no roads lead to the facility, and the
Karst COAAC interdicts the local airspace.  The
facility itself is sealed from the mainland by flooded
access tunnels, and only submersible vehicles operated
by the Countinghouse administration are permitted to
enter its confines at any time.
<P>
<B>Fleets, Regency Frontier:</B>
<P>
<LI>1. <B>55th Fleet (Roughriders):</B>  Deneb Sector "Swing
Fleet" headquartered at Marnie's World/Sabine. The
55th is most famous for its timely arrival in Pretoria
subsector during the Battle of Ashes. Its forces
reinforced the overstretched 194th and 61st fleets in
their battle against invading forces of the Assemblage
of 1116, and the combined force crushed the invaders
decisively.  The ragged, improvised manner in which
the 55th made its way to the battlefront, and the
expert way it regrouped and turned out for battle,
earned it its name.
<P>
<LI>2. <B>61st Fleet (Ericson's Rocs):</B> Fleet responsible for
defense of RQD 3. Headquartered at Uramid/Antra. Fleet
name comes from its early Collapse period commander,
Admiral Arabella von Ericson, a Fifth Frontier War
veteran and hero. Ericson commanded a starmerc
organisation of the same name during the Civil War
period, that was inducted into the 61st and became a
nucleus of resistance against Virus intrusion from the
Vargr Extents. The fleets length of continous service
is one of the longest in the Regency, having faced
Vargr during the entire Civil War period, and then
fighting a mixture of Vargr corsairs and Vampire
Fleets during the Dreamtime.  And because of the
variety of enemies it has had to face, its casualty
rate is the highest in the Regency Navy.
<P>
<LI>3. <B>125th Fleet (Karmic Yeomanry):</B> Namidshur subsector
Fleet. Headquatered at Shinorasus/Namidshur. The 125th
backs up the 183rd in the Frontier, and its forces
have been called upon many times to assist their
neighbors in fighting Vampire incursions.  Namidshur
was a largely backwater subsector previous to the
Civil War and Virus, and its infrastructure and local
institutions were less than able in absorbing large
numbers of Human and Vargr refugees. The 125th has
played a major role in providing shelter and security
for both refugees and their adopted homeworlds,
creating a strong bond between local civilian
communities and the fleets personnel. In return for
this strong support, 125th units are often fanatical
in their defense of local worlds against pirates and
Vampire Ships.
<P>
<LI>4. <B>183rd Fleet (Gatekeepers):</B> Fleet responsible for
defense of RQD 4. Headquartered at Usani/Usani. No
other fleet has seen as much action or combat than the
183rd.  With a wide area of responsibility facing the
main body of the former Imperium and much of the Vargr
Extents, the fleet is subjected to frequent Vampire
incursions. At the peak of the Quarantine War, fleet
units were averaging two or three battles a week
against against ships ranging from errant small craft
to infected former Imperial Dreadnoughts.  Now battles
may occur once or twice a year for most line units,
but the fleet remains a cherry posting for ambitious
and aggressive naval personnel. Demand for Frontier
duty is high enough normally, but the 183rd's G-4
office only has enough billets for about 1 out of
every 10 applications it receives, and its selectivity
makes the fleet one of the most skilled and elite in
the Regency.
<P>
<LI>5. <B>194th Fleet (Iron Guard):</B> Pretoria subsector fleet.
The 194th is less of a battle unit than an internal
peacekeeper. Pretoria has a long history of political
friction, most famously the Rachelean Revolts.
Previous to the Civil War, fleet units were in control
of the subsector capitol itself in the Revolts wake,
and were instrumental in calming and reconciling the
Vilani majority of the subsector with Solomani or
Mixed immigrants.  This experience was highly useful
in the face of large Vargr refugee flows that flooded
the subsector in the period of 1136-1148.  While the
Vargr have proven more difficult to deal with than the
Vilani, the 194th's large number of Civil Affairs
units and long experience in low intensity policing
have kept open warfare from breaking out between
struggling factions and Pack Dens.
<P>
<LI>6. <B>315th Fleet (First to Fight):</B> Lamas subsector
fleet. Headquartered at Lamas/Lamas. Previously known
as the 1st Fleet during the Fifth Frontier War, before
postwar reorganisation cost it its designation, though
it lives on in the fleets nickname. Though in theory
the 315th defends the small sliver of Lamas that is
included in the Safe, in practice its units are
frequently rotated out to the Frontier for exercises
or missions in support of the 61st. Occasionally some
of its units have been assigned to the 183rd, and many
of its squadrons have Wildside combat experience. It
has an unhealthy hatred of Vargr criminal and corsair
elements, and its units have been unnecessarily harsh
in their prosecution of these groups.
<P>
<B>Haggard Station:</B> Forward RISS scout base found on
Haggard/Antra (Deneb 2409). The scout base was one of
the few in the Third Imperium to be constructed
completely underground, as it was originally an
underground containment facility used by the
Exploratory Office for samples it had found during its
wanderings. When the Collapse hit, the base was
abandoned by the Regency, and its personnel were
evacuated safeside. After the Rape of Trin, however,
an RQS survey team discovered that the base was
virtually intact, despite several attempted Vampire
intrusions. With the Regency reexpanding its
surveillance net back into trailing Deneb,
intelligence gathering and liason with local free
traders were seen as very important, and the base was
reoccupied in 1141.
<P>
Haggard Station is less a military outpost than a
trade and contact station, though a full battalion of
marines defend it full time. Most people Passing
through the Frontier use the world as a transit point,
and a number of free traders come here to trade useful
salvage or information with the scouts for needed
manufactured goods or maintenance. Scouts and
Quarantine personnel use its secure containment
facilities to examine either salvage reclaimed in the
wilds, or to test captured or recovered technology for
Virus infection.  It is fitted with medical clinics
and schools that attract free trader patronage, and
many trader collectives take advantage of the
incentives offered by base security.
<P>
<B>Ingram Services:</B> Regency's largest private security
firm. Ingram is a wholly owned subsidiary of JAX/TCP,
the Regency branch of Thanber Consolidated Properties.
Ingram provides security guards both living and
cybernetic, passive and active security systems, and
security consultation for a number of public,
commercial and private clients across the Regency. The
company was once a wholly owned branch of Tukera Lines
Vemene intelligence agency, but was spun off to TCP in
the 1120s. The company once included many of Tukera's
armed patrol and military ships, but these were
requistioned by the Regency in 1132. In the last fifty
years its services have expanded to include
bodyguards, escort and courier services, and even runs
private prisons for subsector and planetary
governments.
<P>
<B>Passing:</B> Colloquial term for people who travel
regularly through the Quarantine between the Safe and
the Wilds. As difficult as it may sound to inhabitants
of the Safe, it is only illegal to make an unregulated
or uninspected crossing of the Frontier from the
Wilds. No ship or person may cross into the Regency
Safe without subjecting themselves to inspection by
the Quarantine Service.
<P>
But there is no law to prevent commercial or
diplomatic contact across the Frontier. A multitude of
technical and economic reasons exist to prevent either
from developing on a large scale, but it does
infrequently occur, especially with Free Trader
Collectives friendly to the Regency. In the early
years of the Quarantine people who actually took their
chances outside of the Safe were considered to be
suicidal, but nowadays when it happens it garners more
curiosity than disgust. RQS and military regulations
prevent personnel and ships from indulging in this
trade, and Free Traders are guaranteed a monopoly on
what commerce does exist. Most of this is a kind of
beads and trinkets trade, or exists mostly at the
official level with Traders passing along valuable
salvage in exchange for ship maintenance and high
value manufactured goods. Even more significant is the
passage of persons, mostly children of Free Traders
and even a few local warlords dispatched to the Safe
for education and rearing, many of whom return to the
Wilds and often agitate for the opening of the
Frontier as adults.
<P>
<B>Pretorian Way:</B> J-1 route linking 16 worlds from
Lewis/Aramis to Gyrfal/Lamas.  The Way was of marginal
importance in the antebellum period, as few of its
worlds were that important. Since the Collapse the
rebirth of Pretoria, the flowering of Urnas, and the
growth of the Quarantine have made it a high capacity
route. Many of its worlds possess substantial Vargr
populations, and several are fait accompli. Conflicts
between Vargr Pack factions, and tensions between
human and Vargr communities tend to drag down local
commerce at times. (Pete's Note:</B> This was omitted from
the earlier Astrography Data.)
<P>
<B>Rachelean Revolts:</B> The bloody race riots that tore
apart Pretoria/Pretoria and several neighboring worlds
during the early 1000s. The rioters were mostly
Vilani, rebelling against the Pro-Solomani practices
of the sector duke, whose family had long repressed
them and outlawed Vilani culture and language. These
riots culminated in the creation of the Rachele
Society, and the destruction of the scout base, and
subsequent killing of 26,000 civilians, on nearby Saki
(Deneb 0306)
<P>
Pretoria, along with many other worlds in Deneb, was
heavily settled by Vilani in the first century of the
Third Imperium. Later colonisation waves of Solomani
and mixed blood humans eventually assimilated into
these communities, and the racial distinction faded
away on most worlds. But on Pretoria the Vilani were
able to preserve their cultural heritage almost
intact, as their urban communities were tightly
organised around small neighborhood sized collectives.
This led to some tension with immigrating Solomani,
but in nearly every case these were assimilated into
Pretorian culture without much trouble.
<P>
But in the wake of Arbellatra Alkhalikoii's ascension,
a number of troublesome Solomani nobles were relocated
or exiled by the new Empress to the far frontiers of
the empire for a variety of reasons. And to Pretoria
she assigned a former Daibei sector noble family, of
pureblooded Solomani descent, known as the
Carles-Davies. It was to have disastrous consequences.
The Carles-Davies were sympathetic to the Solomani
movement, and their forced relocation to Pretoria had
the effect of hardening their fervor. In their new
position as Duke of Pretoria, they cracked down hard
on "Vilani intransigence."  The Vilani language was
banned in favor or Anglic, Vilani merchants and
businesses were subject to harassment and onerous laws
and regulations, and the authority of the neighborhood
councils were curtailed in favor of a bureaucratic
government that favored the Duke or Duchess.  The
advent of the Psionic Suppressions were used as an
excuse to practically ban all forms of Vilani cultural
and political expression, and Pretoria became a police
state patrolled by the Carles-Davies huscarles' and
hated Uniformity Police.
<P>
Because of this pressure, traditional education and
authority had to go underground. Educators formed
secret shadow academies where students were taught the
Vilani language and culture, in small dormitories and
cloistered classrooms. Attempts to ferret out these
"school-rings" with random searches and expedient mass
arrests further radicalised the population, and many
school-rings became training grounds for terrorists
and resistance cells. One ring produced Zidi Rachele,
an extreme Vilani supremacist who called for the
extermination of non-Vilani races in favor of a
racially pure "Fourth Imperium."  Despite the obvious
insanity of his message, the fact that many local
Pretorians sided with his and his terrorist society
was an indication of how desperate the population had
become.
<P>
The revolt coincided with the end of the Solomani Rim
War, and in its wake an Imperial intervention seized
Pretoria, and the Carles-Davies were liquidated by the
newly appointed Sector Duke.  Pretoria was subject to
a hundred and sixty years of military occupation,
which was only ended by the Representational Reforms.
<P>
<B>Syr Darya Crisis of 1156:</B> Viral invasion of Syr
Darya/Antra in 1156. A very large fleet of mixed
Imperial and Vargr military ships, controlled by a
pair of Alliance Builder strain Viruses, penetrated
the Regency frontier shortly after Holiday, and seized
Syr Darya in a lightning attack. The fleet grounded a
massive 100,000 ton bulk carrier they had somehow
managed to secure, and began to dismantle it and the
large base facilities it was carrying, burying the
pieces in a large underground warren near the
downport. The first Regency counterattack was beaten
back with heavy losses, and it took a full planetary
invasion, complete with large ground force
contingents, before the Vampires were defeated and the
world was reclaimed. The attack weakened the Frontier
border enough to permit another Vampire Hive to invade
Antra, in what is now known as the War of the Antra
Pocket.
<P>
<B>United Followers of Augurgh:</B> Former Vargr interstellar
state located in the lower trailing-rimward corner of
Tuglikki sector. Augurgh was a very charismatic Vargr
of vision, who convinced millions of Vargr of the
merits of his vision for a technological paradise.
Unfortunately his state proved just as susceptible to
the Oekhsos tirades of the antebellum period, and a
number of associated corsair bands invaded parts of
Deneb sector in 1116. Augurgh was not as Anti-Imperial
as his neighbors, but had to play the game or face
attack from other "spacewolves." Augurgh died a
premature death under suspicious circumstances in
1138, and his followers were snuffed out by Virus in
1143.<P>

<B>War, The Antra Pocket:</B> "Insurgency" war fought over
several worlds of RQD 3 between the Regency and a
large coalition of Puppeteer viruses in the period of
1160-1165. Three Puppeteer fleets took over the world
of Tuedhikhuez/Antra (Deneb 1905) in 1159, and began
infiltrating the Regency Frontier near Dunant/Antra
(Deneb 1806). This was accomplished through the
audacious use of Vargr guerillas formerly associated
with a God Virus that had been taken over by one of
the fleets. The guerillas were supported by well
balanced units of warships that took up position at
strategic locations in a system. Under the protective
screen of orbital firepower, the guerillas seized
strategic and easily defended targets, in many cases
abandoned or partially abandoned communities in the
outbacks of several Frontier worlds.
<P>
Because Regency forces in the Frontier were organised
to repel massed fleet units, and not more mobile
raiders, the response of its fleets were initially
clumsy and hamhanded. The raiders would attack small
targets, induce the less mobile Regency forces to
counterattack, and then would melt away after
inflicting heavy losses. The viral strategy was rather
simple:</B> to wear down the Frontier defenses through
attrition until its forces could effect a full
breakthrough. A break in the fighting in 1162 gave
Regency forces the time to reorganise the local 61st
Fleet into smaller task forces, and shift from a
reactive defense posture to actively seeking out the
main Virus Hive and its base. Defense squadrons
contained further attacks, and dedicated Pathfinder
units tracked the retreating Virus fleets into the
Wilds. Finally in 1165 the 61st, reinforced by the
315th and 55th Fleets, cornered and destroyed the main
hive at Tuedhikhuez. The patient tactics of the Antra
viruses signalled a shift in Viral organisation and
sophistication, and reinforced the reorganisation of
Regency naval doctrine.
<P>
<B>Wilderness Ranger Corps:</B> The conservation and
wilderness policing arm of the Ministry of the
Interior. They were formerly a part of the Imperial
Ministry of Conservation, and were merged with the
Ministry of Colonisation to help form the new agency.
The WRC is the main policing service encountered in
Regency reserves, colonial worlds, and wilderness
preserves.  The Rangers are the primary police force,
outside of the major communities, on Marastan/Glisten
for example. Rangers are also entrusted with the
protection, preservation and operation of the
Regency's various Ancient sites since 1133. Since the
Abandonment, most worlds in the coreward Frontier are
policed by selected units of Rangers in cooperation
with local RQS cadres. In many cases Rangers patrol
abandoned communities, preventing takeovers by Vargr
or Viral squatters.
