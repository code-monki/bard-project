<P>
 These rules are
 primarily transfered from <cite>High Guard</cite>, though the rock's density is a guess
 based on my science data book giving marble a density of 2600 kg/m^3.
 <P>


 Given that rock has a toughness of 0.2, and a density of 2500 kg/m^3 a
 Planetiod hull will have an AV of 15, and a Buffered Planetoid an AV of
 30 (assuming they're roughly sphereoid).
 <P>
 The internal structure of either type of Planetoid hull gives enough
 bracing for 5G, more than enough even allowing for some of the rock to
 be walls, etc and not really structural.
 <P>
 <cite>High Guard</cite> gives a tunnelling cost of MCr0.001 per DT, compared to FFS's
 MCr0.001 per 36 m^3 for meson deep site shafts. I'm using the HG costs,
 as IMO mining an asteriod so that it can be used as a ship is probably
 trickier than drilling deep meson sites. There is also a cost of
 MCr0.0001 per DT to move and set up the planetoid.
 <P>
 Thus we have:<P>

 <table border=0>
 <tr><TH>Hull Form <TH>          MVM <TH> Usl       <TH>     Sl  <TH> AF  <TH> LM <TH> AV<TH>  MaxG
<tr BGCOLOR=#BBBBBBBB><TD> Planetoid      <TD>     1  <TD>  MCr0.0009/DT  <TD> N/A <TD> N/A  <TD>1  <TD> 15 <TD> 1 (structure  for 5)</tr>
<tr> <TD>Buffered Planetoid <TD> 1  <TD>  MCr0.00075/DT <TD> N/A <TD>  N/A <TD> 1 <TD>  30<TD> 3 (structure  for 5)</tr>
 </table>
 <P>
 It would also seem reasonable that Planetoid hulls can't mount spinal
weapons, however paralell mounts should be OK.
