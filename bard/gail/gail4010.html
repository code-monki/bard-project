<B>Fishing (Explore--INT):</B> Ability to catch aquatic lifeforms, using hook
and line, traps, nets, harpoons, or other similar devices.  Unlike
"survival fishing" (an ability imparted by Survival skill), fisherman
have knowledge regarding how to catch specific breeds and types of
aquatic lifeforms to the exclusion of others, and have the ability to
land particularly large aquatic lifeforms (those over 250 kilograms)
such as swordfish or whales.<P>

   Catching fish (or an alien equivalent) over 250 kilograms with
adequate equipment is normally a Difficult task.  This increases to
Formidable without it.  Fabricating proper fishing equipment for large
aquatic lifeforms is an Average task, provided proper supplies are
available.  The referee should adjust the difficulty of these tasks
according to the size and orneriness of the aquatic lifeforms the
character is attempting to catch.<P>

<B>Gunsmith (Technician-AGL):</B> Ability to construct, modify, maintain and
repair small arms.  A gunsmith's experience and background includes a
working knowledge of currently available weapons, a historical knowledge
of other weapons, and an ability to find references which help in
handling otherwise unknown weapons.<P>

   The difficulty of Gunsmith tasks varies greatly with the task the
character is trying to accomplish, and what tools the character may or
may not have at hand.  Most normal tasks (fitting and sighting in a
telescopic sight, reloading CPR Firearm rounds) are Average with the
proper equipment.  Some tasks, like constructing an improvised CPR
Firearm (aka "zip gun") or making adjustments to the internal ignition
lasers on a plasma rifle are normally Average tasks, but become
Difficult, Uncertain tasks with potentially fatal results if not perform
the proper tools.  Identifying an unknown weapon is normally a Difficult
task, and can increase to Formidable if the character is forced to work
from poor quality photographs instead of actually being able to handle
the weapon.<P>

   In all cases, the referee should carefully evaluate what task the
player wants his character to perform, and advise against particularly
risky actions ("mounting that on your gauss pistol is probably not a
good idea").  <P>

<B>Scrounging (Explore-INT):</B> The character is skilled in finding relic
items such as spare parts, tools, vac suits, weapons, etc.  Scrounging
involves more than just randomly searching through ruins.  An individual
with this skill is familiar with the kinds of ruins to search for a
particular relic item and where within those ruins that item is most
likely to be found.  In the case of a previously contacted inhabited
world, the individual will have knowledge of the proper inhabitants to
contact regarding the availability of relics, local laws governing their
sale and possession, and be aware of specific areas on the planet where
relics are most likely to be found.  When a character attempts to
scrounge for a specific object, the referee determines difficulty based
on his or her opinion of the likelihood the object is where the
character is looking.  The higher a character's Scrounging skill, the
more likely he is to find useful things in unlikely places.<P>

<B>Writing (Social Science--INT):</B> Enables a character to present
insightful, entertaining reading materials, factual or fictitious.  If
used in combination with skills such as Computer or Mechanic, the
character has the ability to write technical manuals.  Print journalists
(those that write for newspapers or magazines as opposed to electronic
journalists which work on camera or in front of a microphone) would
likely have high levels of Writing skill, and can take it as a
substitute for the other skills listed in the Journalist career on page
47 of the TNE manual.<P>

<B>Security (Perception-INT):</B> The individual is knowledgeable in the area
of security procedures. This includes both physical security and
anti-terrorism security.  <P>

   Physical security reflects a familiarity with the proper use and
placement of a variety of physical security devices, including
mechanical and electronic locks, alarm systems, and a wide spectrum of
sensors, including infrared sensors and cameras.  While it is the job of
experts in this skill to prevent break-ins (usually by individuals with
Intrusion skill), their special knowledge can be of great assistance to
someone attempting defeat a physical security system.<P>

   Anti-terrorism security covers a broad spectrum of security
procedures designed to deter terrorism and other similar criminal
behavior.  These include the proper deployment and use of scanning
equipment (bomb and weapon detectors), "hands on" physical search
techniques, correct procedures for establishing security patrols and
escorts, check points, motorcades, and convoys.<P>
