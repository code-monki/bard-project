reported by Eric Bould<p>
Following a brief debate this morning, the RC Assembly overwhelmingly
voted to redesignate the RCN's currently building Lancer and
Fusilier-class warships as "frigates."  The reason for the change was
largely a desire on part of the majority of Assembly delegates to make a
clean break with Last Imperium traditions, and has been highlighted over
the last few weeks in the atmosphere of probably hostilities between the
RC and the still-mysterious Empire of Solee.  Opposition to the change
in nomenclature was restricted to a few scattered delegates, most of
whom were former serving navy personnel who felt such a change to be, in
the words of Aubani senior delegate Calvan Broadus, "silly,
inconsequential, and unconstructive in the face of present realities."
The new frigates will be sleek TL-12 warships in the 4000
displacement-ton range, and will be armed with a powerful suite of
offensive and defensive systems; as the Coalition's first purpose-built
fighting craft, they will constitute a completely new design, although
some observers have noted that their overall visual configuration bears
certain similarities to Imperial era battle riders of the
Gallant-class.  The first two vessels of their classes, Fusilier and
Lancer, are expected to be released to the RCN for shakedown sometime
later this month.<p>

reported by Eric Bould<p>

The Commodore, Reformation Coalition Exploratory Service, regrets to
annouce that Reformation Coalition Ship Thomas Paine (TailNo 10054) is
missing and presumed lost in routine operations within Aubaine
subsector.  Thomas Paine is a Scout Courier of the Carson-Class,
displacing 100tons, and carrying a crew of five.  She was refitted at
Aubaine, and was engaged in recovery operations along the spinward
frontier at the time of her loss.
RCES has been unable to confirm the reason for this ship's
disappearance, although some observers within the Service speculate taht
the vessel may have run afoul of Vampire encroachment off the Khulam
Main.  Search and rescue operations aimed at recovering the vessel's
crew are currently underway.<p>

reported by Eric Bould<P>

RC Space Forces and the Aubani Navy have been put on alert following
this morning's dramatic escape from Aubaine's Anchordrift Detention
Barracks.  Guards escorting former RCES Captain Anselm "Viper" Adair
were overpowered and stunned by masked and heavily-armed assailants
during a routine prisoner transfer between buildings of the mammoth
prison facility.  Moments later, the prison parimeter was penetrated by
an armed G-Carrier that landed to spirit the escaping party away. 
Attempts at pursuit by local law enforcement were frustrated when New
Antipode Police G-Cars came under anti-aircraft missile fire from
unknown positions in the neighborhood around the prison.  Although no
casualties have been reported, two police G-Cars were heavilly damaged,
and damages to the prison and surrounding neighborhood have been
estimated at Cr300,000.<p>
Adair is the former captian of the RCS <i>Trigger</i>, and was sentenced
to fifteen years of imprisonment for his role in the so-called
"<i>Trigger</i> Incident" following his court-martial in Aries.  Adair,
who remained unrepentant throughout his trial, claimed at his sentencing
to have been made into a "scapegoat" by "weak-kneed and weak-willed
federalist Boy Scouts," and vowed revenge on the court as "an instrument
of cowardice."<p>
The military precision and abundant weaponry displayed by Adair's
rescuers has law enforcement officials targeting their investigation on
certain independent relic salvagers and mercenaries resident on
Aubaine.  As <i>Trigger's</i> captain, Adair had extensive contacts
among the Free Lancer community, many members of which regarded his
conviction as a travesty of justice.  It is thought that Adair may
attempt to unobtrusively slip off-planet aboard one of the many
loosely-regulated tramp starships attending Auction.  In the meantime,
descriptions of Adair have been circulated to all relevant law
enforcement and military authorities, as well as all RC member worlds.

KEYWORDS: <B>ADMISSION BILL, ORIFLAMME, RC ASSEMBLY, TELDORA</B><br>
 reported by Eric Bould<p>
In a move bound to irritate Oriflammen sensibilities, and generate
further controversy, the local officials of the Government of Helios
today held a joint press conference with members of a delegation from
the planet Teldora in which it was announced that Helios would openly
sponsor that planet's bid for full Coalition membership.  Rumors of such
a move have been floating about RC political circles for several months,
but today's announcement seems to have taken both centerists and
federalists alike completely by surprise.<p>
The process of admission for new Coalition member worlds has become
mired in controversy over the last six months.  Attempts by leading
delegates from both federalist and centerist camps to introduce an
"Admission Bill" have bogged down in violently partisan arguments over
the criterion for membership.  Federalists have argued for a poliicy of
"quick and easy" admission, while centerists have proposed a more
complicated scheme based on economic and societal compatability;
furthermore, Oriflamme has proposed allowing certian "moderate"
Technically Elevated Dictatorships as new members, provided such regimes
make efforts to reform their governments along feudal technocratic lines
under RC supervision.  This prospect is extremely distasteful to most
federalists, and had drawn critism fomr certian members of the centerist
camp, notably Baldur and Fija.<p>
At the heart of any argument over admission standards lies the issue of
current federalist-centerist balance-of-power.  Politicians from both
camps fear that adoption of proposals generated from the other side will
lead to a decisive shift in the current power arrangement, leading to
dominance of one side or another, perhaps with fatal results for the
Coalition's fragile unity.  Opposition to this "Machiavellian" view of
Coalition politics had come loudest from RC Secretary General Lon
Maggart, and senior Nimban delegate Ged Eflin, both of whom have made
repeated and strenuous calls for a "higher unity" in the face of greater
threats to the Coalition as a whole.<p>
It is thought by independent observers of RC politics that Helios'
advocacy of Teldora will function as a "throwing of the gauntlet" into
the face of the majority of delegates who have preferred to postpone
engaging the issue.  Speculations that Oriflamme would offer a quid pro
quo of Coalition membership for Teldora in exchange for the admission of
Nex must now be put on hold; it was thought that such a deal would be
worked out between Aubaine and Oriflamme as leading champions of their
respective blocs, particularly after Teldoran and Nexian officials were
observed attending a meeting on Lucifer with high-ranking Aubani and
Oriflammen politicians last Capricorn.  Privately, local Aubani and
Oriflammen representatives on this least-populated world of the
Coalition have been reported as "seething."<p>
Teldora and Nex are both independent worlds situated on the back face of
Oriflammen subsector.  Nex (1431/Oriflamme, X55476A-6) is a moderately
advanced agricultural planet located 4 parsecs from the Coalition
border.  The planet is currently ruled by a TED, albeit not a very harsh
and repressive one, Military Governor Haim Laszczansk.  Laszczansk has
made friendly overtures to the Coalition, and has proposed intergration
into the RC, provided he is given suitable technical and educational
assistance to uplift his highly xenophobic and technophobic
population.<p>
Teldora (1437/Oriflamme, D5548AC-9, managed to survive the collapse
unusually well, mainly thanks to its strong native culture and
indepented spirit.  Its Civil Service Bureaucracy cooperated with early
Hiver recontact efforts within the Old Expances during the early 1190's,
but refused to join the Dawn League or Reformation Coalition out of fear
of losing it's planet's independence.  After Oriflamme's invasion of
Spencer, Teldora provided arms and training to Spencerian insurgents in
an attempt to curb what it saw as Oriflammen "Imperialism;" this has
caused a great deal of mistrust and tension to grow up between Teldora
and the rest of the RC, a situation which the Government of Teldora is
anxious to bring to an end.<p>

reported by Eric Bould.<P>

RCN forces, under the command of Captain Werner Lane, and designated as
Task Group 17, have advanced to this remote desert world of the Shenk
Rimward Main in preperation for as yet undisclosed operation against the
Soleean Empire.<p>
The Coalition thust into the Main comes at a time when numerous reports,
mostly second-hand accounts from the Free Trader Network, have come
pouring into RC Intelligence organizations regarding Soleean activity to
Coreward of this region.  Most suggest that the Soleeans are engaged in
a large-scale intelligence blitz attempting to locate the Coalition
homeworlds.  Although this has raised some alarm among the naval
planning staff, unofficial sources within RC Intelligence have termed
these activities as "amateurish and heavy-handed," and contemptuously
describe the Soleean technique as the "Have you seen Baggins?"
method.<p>
Tequila has been chosen for a staging area due to its centeral location
and status as a strong, if somewhat unusual, Coalition ally within the
Main.  Negotiations between the task force commander and planetary
oficials regarding Coalition presence within the system are currently
underway, but are expected to be resolved within the next few days.<p>

Tequila is ruled by the Archangel Hoshophet, a remnant Imperial who
emerged from cryogenic suspension to find himself acclaimed as a
demi-god by the planetary inhabitants.  Forced by circumstances to play
out the role of Messiah, and unwilling to allow the planet to revert to
the chaos and anarchy that prceded his "miraculous resurrection," the
Archangel decided to quietly steer his people towards a more progressive
social order.  Although expected to live and rule from an ostentatious
Archangel's Palace, Hoshophet wielded his authority to promote
educational, industrial, and social reform as integral to his "new
order."  Finally unmasked as a fake by an RCES undercover team last
year, Hoshophet decided to go into exile in the Coalition, but found his
people unwilling to part with him.  He currently retains both his
postion and his title, although local religious scriptures ahve been
reinterpreted somewhat to account for his mortality.<p>

reported by Eric Bould<P>

Following a somber farewell ceremony consisting mostly of members of the
press and a few visibly uncomfortable planetary officials, nearly three
hundred Garvey Society colonists boarded the freelance transport SS
<i>Minnow</i> for the first stage of their journey to an as yet
undisclosed colony location somewhere beyond Coalition Space.  The
ceremony which was held in a starport hanger amid downpouring rain,
lasted a bare ten minutes, and consisted mainly of a long diatribe
against Reformation Coalition society punctuate by a few cryptic
announcements regarding the movement's plans.<p>

As far as could be determined from the gist of spokesman Eugene Engili's
remarks, the colony is to be located somewhere Rimward of Coalition
Space, probably in the Alpha Leonis sector.  A suitable terrestrial
world
possibly populated by non-human sentients, referred to Enligi as "worth,
but undeveloped natives," had been located, and a prospective colony
site surveyed and cleared for arrival.  In related remarks, Engili
announced that he had been nominated as First Adminisrator and colony
leader.<p>

Outside observers of the Garvey Society have been unable to explain the
unexpected resources of this marginal fringe group, and their apparent
success in organizing such a lavishly equipped mission in such a short
time.  Examination by reporters of the ship's hold revealed a wealth of
expensive high-tech survival equipment and relic Imperial automated
fabrication units.  Interviews with departing colonists indicated an
enormous pride and satisfaction among the group in having procured these
relic devices through their own efforts; inquiries as to how the
colonial survey and transport were funded tended to receive more
ambiguous answers.<p>
"Perhaps it's just someone willing to spend good money to get rid of a
few nuts," sighed Shenandoah Rural Police Commissioner Angela Ling, as
the glow of <i>Minnow's</i> engine exhaust faded into the Shenandoahan
night.<p>

Condemning RC service dress as "pedestrian, depressing and hopelessly

would be submitting a series of new uniform changes to the Reformation
Coalition Assembly for ratification sometime shortly before the end of
the year.<p>

the controversial designer, "but we don't have to loose our good
taste."<p>

Proposed uniform changes include a shift away from the standard black,
blue, or green color schemes to soft pastels and what Serge called "a
deliciously decadent paisley pattern."  Additional proposals include the
creation of tartan fatigues for the Reformation Coalition Marine Corps,
new headgear, and what Serge termed as "accessories, accessories,
accessories!"<p>

The only current item of RC issue gear not on Serge's chopping block
consisted of the RCES black bodysleeve, which Serge referred to as "a
camp masterpiece," and a "provocatively, subersively, erotic."  The
designer added, however, "that it might perhap look a bit better with a
cowl."<p>

Following today's sudden announcement of their deployment, members of

an undisclosed location somewhere on Oriflamme, presumably to board

of the brigade's departure suggests the previous existence of a well

mysterious drills conducted by the brigade over the past two months.<p>

Unconfirmed reports by planetary officials suggest that a large number
of starships are already in orbit and are standing by as a part of the
operation.  These unofficial sources were unable to confirm whether
these starships consist of transports, or are part of a larger combined

KEYWORDS: <B>BOOTSTRAP, DLS HORUS, MARAX, RCES, SOLEE</B><br>reported by Eric Bould<P>

Nearly six months after the successful DLS <i>Horus</i> rescue mission,
RCES has begun a series of large scale bootstrap operations on this
world at the edge of the AO.  These operations are aimed at both
improving the living conditions of the local populace and providing a
safe port for forward RC operations in both the Thoezennt and Shenk
subsectors.<p>

Given the growing hostilities between the Coalition and Solee, Marax is
seen as being ideally situated to provide a Coreward point of entry to
the Shenk Subsector.  Work is currently underway to upgrade Marax's
starport from its current D rating to the more capable C rating
Coalition Warships may require for in-field repairs during the up coming
Soleean Conflict.<p>
 
With the death of Marax's ruler, Ushugaam II, and the destruction of
most of the planets political and military leadership during the rescue
mission, members of local resistance organizations together with a
number of covert RC operatives quickly seized control of key
installations and set up a provisional government to deal with the
crisis situation.  This newly formed government expressed an immediate
desire to enter into negotiations with the RC for technical assistance
and eventual admission into the Coalition.  Though it took more than
three months for a Coalition Contact Team to arrive on Marax they were
sufficiently impressed with the level of social reforms instituted by
the new government to endorse Marax's application for technical
assistance in exchange for Coalition control of Azura Downport for the
duration of Soleean hostilities.<p>

BASE</B><br>reported by Eric Bould<P>

Coalition forces are preparing to depart Egg following their successful
raid on the secret Guild base located in the remote fringes of the
system's asteroid belt.  The operation, code-named Operation Tart, was
initiated several weeks ago following the receipt of intelligence by RC
Space Forces describing the Guild base and providing detailed
information on its location and defensive systems.  The hastily formed
Task Force Tart, was dispatched from Trybec under the command of
Commander Pat "Who Me?" Ritter, and consisted of RCS
<i>Thunderchild</i>, RCS <i>Ridgerunner</i>, and RCS <i>Tetley</i>.<p>

"It was Dog-pile on the Guild Day," commented Commander Ritter, the task
force CO.<p>

Coalition forces used the system's dense asteroid field as cover to
close into visual distance of the modified Imperial-era space station
used by the Guild as a repair and fueling depot.  A close assault by RC
Marines on the station itself was timed with a simultaneous strike by
the task force's lasers that downed the station's life support system,
and sent panicked Guildsmen scrambling into vac suits as Coalition
assault troops blasted their way into the station's interior.  A Guild
patrol cruiser that attempted to detach itself from the station and
leave the area was summarily blasted by the task force, leaving it
little more than a smoldering hulk adrift in space.<p>

Coalition spokesmen have been extremely cagey regarding exactly what was
recovered from the station, but unofficial interviews with Coalition
Marines involved in the assault indicate that a large number of
prisoners were taken and that the station's command center was captured
intact.  In addition, an unusually high number of Hiver and Schalli
computer specialists assigned to the mission suggests that the Admiralty
expects a large intelligence payoff from the mission.  Privately,
intelligence officers attached to the task force are ecstatic, and one
characterized the raid as "the beginning of the end for the Guild as we
know it."<p>

The destruction of the Guild station at Egg is believed to be a serious
blow to Mercantile Guild operations within Khulam subsecter and further
Trailward.  Deprived of a safe haven to rest and refit, it is thought
that the Guild will have to scale back its current activities within the
region, perhaps pulling back to as-yet unknown facilities to Spinward. 
Although currently enmeshed in a potentially explosive situation
vis-�-vis Soleean expansion in Shenk subsector, military observers
predict that a major Coalition campaign against the Guild in Diaspora is
only a matter of time.<p><hr>

THOMAS PAINE</B><br>reported by Eric Bould<P>

In what RCES spokesmen have privately described as a "miracle," RCS
<i>Suleiman Victrix</i> arrived last night at RCES Yard Aubaine carrying
survivors of the missing Coalition starship <i>Thomas Paine</i>. 
Current reports are still sketchy, and all personnel involved are still
being held for extensive debriefing, but unofficial RCES sources have
disclosed rough details of what appears to have been an extraordinary
odyssey on the part of the missing crew.<p>

<i>Thomas Paine</i> apparently fell victim to a PDM on Nicosia and was
forced to make an emergency landing in an outback region near the
Northern terminus of the Australian Empire.  Though their ship was
destroyed in the decent the crew of the <i>Thomas Paine</i> managed to
escape relatively unscathed, and after going-to-ground for a few weeks
they began gathering intelligence on the operations, organization and
general sophistication of the Australian Empire's military forces.<p>

After several weeks of intelligence gathering the crew was hunted down
and eventually captured by forces loyal to the Australian Emperor,
Nicholas Rufin.  In exchange for technical assistance Rufin turned the
crew over to the Mercantile Guild at-which-time they were to be
transported to an unknown Guild base.  This Guild vessel was
subsequently overwhelmed by forces belonging to Arturo I in the
Lefiguura system.  In need of fuel and repairs the DSE vessels including
the captured Guild vessel put down on Lefiguura when the Coalition
prisoners quickly escaped.<p>

The crew of the <i>Thomas Paine</i> their numbers reduced by the
treatment they had suffered at the hands of the Guild once again
went-to-ground and quickly became embroiled in local Lefiguuran
politics.  After a number of weeks worth of cloak-and-dagger
maneuverings reached they eventually came to an amicable settlement with
local ruler Elinore Bonatiates.  The crew eventually made their way to
the Lefiguuran mainland where a number of weeks later they managed to
link up with a passing Free Trader, who returned them to Coalition
Space.<p>

The survivors include Kayla "Voodoo" Shadow-walker, Dr. Tavril "Grumble"
Habeus, and Hive Federation Advisor Elvis.  All three are decorated and
experienced RCES veterans.  The other two <i>Thomas Paine</i>
crewmembers, Grell "Stonewall" Charest and Noble "Birdman" Ortiz, are
reported to have been killed in action.<p>
