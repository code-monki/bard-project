<b>Aika-Namon:</b> Cartel created out of the merger of Aika
Mining and Namon Systems in 1134. Headquarted on
Efate. The company is unusually aggressive, in many
ways harkening back to the Imperial past with its
choice of tactics, but has generally kept out of
trouble in its Regency operations. The company has a
strong presence in the Four Corners region of the
Spinward Marches, but has operations all over the
Regency and most of the Marches and Trojan Reach.
<P>
<b>Bailey-Harbour:</b> Small but well regarded shipbuilder in
the Spinward Marches. BH is headquartered on Regina,
but does most of its business in Jewell, Vilis and
Lanth subsectors. Its product line is centered around
the production of Type A and A2 traders, Fat Traders,
and several specialty and modular freighter designs
held under patent by the company exclusively.  BH does
most of its business by referral, and does not produce
very many ships annually. But its quality is very
high, and its waiting list averages four years.  In
1193 the company bought a new shipyard on
Tanoose/Vilis, one that has been orientated towards
the low end market, and produces the new Spartan class
modular merchant for independents and small companies.

<P>
<b>DMZ:</b> The old Demilitarised Zone created between the
Third Imperium and the Zhodani Consulate, in a large
swath of coreward Spinward Marches. This was the
result of the armistice that ended the Third Frontier
War. The territory ceded by the Third Imperium to
create this zone comprised a very large area in
Jewell, Querion and Vilis subsectors, and includes a
number of Imperial culture worlds that have become
independent powers, including the Federation of Arden.
The region has long been the main meeting ground
between the old Third Imperium and the Zhodani. It has
also been a region of power jockeying between the
Imperium/Regency, Zhodani, Federation of Arden and the
Darrian Confederation.
<P>



<B>Ebokin:</B> (This completes the entry in Regency Sourcebook and Behind the Claw) The
Ebokin are methane breathers, and live in conditions
near zero degrees centigrade.
<P>
<b>Garoo Republic:</b> Former small polity formed by Garoo
(SM 0130) in the early Civil War period. Garoo was
settled about the same time that Daryen was reached by
the Izmir Corporation, and bad blood has existed with
the Darrian Confederation stemming from its attempts
to annex the world during its Golden Age. The Darrian
Renaissance that resulted from the Fifth Frontier War,
and the weakening of Imperial control over the
Confederation just prior to the outbreak of the Civil
War, concerned Garoo so much that it formed a military
junta, and annexed its old colony of Uniqua (SM 0129)
in 1116. Escalating tensions with the Darrians came to
a boil after the announcement of the Quarantine, and
Republic forces invaded Kardin (SM 0429), Bularia
(0430) and Dorannia (SM 0530) after these worlds were
illegally annexed by the Confederacy in 1132. The
resulting Garoo War cost Garoo a large part of their
military, and forced it to become a Regency Client
State. The war did force the Regency to scotch further
Darrian territorial ambitions, and accelerated the
expansion of its area of responsibility into trailing
Foreven Sector.
<P>
<b>Kaldi Research:</b> Prominent research and general science
firm in the Regency. Kaldi has two main branches:</b> a
dirtside branch that does research for governments and
corporations, and a spaceside branch that loans
research and survey ships and their crews to various
parties for whatever purposes their clients have in
mind. Kaldi operates at least three Regency research
stations in the Spinward Marches:</b> Beta on Yori/Regina,
Epsilon on Vreibefger/Lanth, and Eta on
Judice/Plankwell.  Kaldi tends to concentrate in the
physical sciences, and avoids military contracts
whenever possible.
<P>
<b>MainLines:</b> Small shipping company headquartered on
Quiru/Lunion. The company had "sailed close to the
wind" in the antebellum and Civil War period, and it
apparently continued its illegal operations even after
the Quarantine was imposed. Its crews engaged in
widespread smuggling, with company knowledge and even
encouragement, and MoJ and RQS were forced to
intervene. In 1143 the company's headquarters were
raided, much of its personnel were jailed and
subsequently convicted of Quarantine violations, and
Quiru recieved its much hated RQS administration all
as a result of MainLines inability to recognise the
changing of the times.
<P>
<b>March Lines:</b> Famous operator of subsidised merchants.
The company was founded by the crew of the legendary
March Harrier in 1110, and was notorious for its run
ins with Imperial authorities. The company was a slow
grower, possessing about a dozen small traders that
operated in Regina and Aramis subsectors. The demise
of its old nemesis, Tukera Lines, resulted in the
purchase of several dozen ships in the Fire Sale, and
the later acquisition of a part of Tukera's
maintenance facility on Natoko/Aramis. The company has
been headquartered out of Aramis' Leedor Downport
since 1132.
<P>
<b>Mewey:</b> Humanoid species native to Mewey/Five Sisters
(SM 0838). Mewey are bipeds roughly similar to humans
in size and body chemistry. A very peaceable species,
nevertheless they strongly resisted the Third
Imperium's attempts at assimilating their world into
its frontiers. The Collapse induced them to accept
inclusion into the much smaller Regency of Deneb, and
only after Norris' people made several concessions.
The Mewey are enthusiastic traders, and have strong
ties with several Aslan trading companies.  Mewey are
mostly found on their homeworld or their colony on
nearby Ochecate (SM 0837).
<P>
<B>Midway:</B> The old Imperial-era trade route from
Rhylanor, through Sabine, Inar, Namidshur and coreward
Vincennes and Star Lane subsectors. This region was
very heavily developed in antebellum times. Even in
those days there existed deeply ingrained
technological and economic rivalries between the
leading worlds of the region.  In contrast to the
Stronghold, the Midway held all of Deneb Sectors
highest technology.  Competition was a four way tug
between Magash/Sabine, Starn/Inar, Rhylanor/Rhylanor,
and of course Vincennes/Vincennes, with Kubishush,
Ashasi and Thingen fighting over niche markets.  These
rivalries never took on tradewar proportions, as it
would have prompted an Imperial intervention harmful
to business.  But there was petty intrigue, nasty
pricing and industrial espionage galore.
<P>
Regional unity became a casualty of their bickering,
as it was apt to paralyse the region even in times of
crisis. This backbiting was one of the major reasons
for both the Industrial Development Program, and the
choice of Mora as a TL16 world.
<P>
<b>Minotaur:</b> A corporation that is engaged in a mazelike,
often times multinational, network of companies of
dubious or illegal ownership. The imposition of the
Quarantine, and Regency crackdowns on corporate
behavior winked at during the Imperial period
compelled many corps to skirt the law any way they
could. Most Minotaurs are controlled by Imperial corps
with a previous history of widespread misbehavior.
Most of these companies are circular, meaning that
they control or are controlled by, subsidiaries that
appear to be completely seperate, but eventually
reconverge somewhere in the chain of interlocking
ownership. Some companies even "zigzag", with the
lines of ownership jumping national borders several
times. Regency laws outlaw the most obvious kinds of
Minotaurs, but the need for export/import trade has
limited legislation against the more nimble or
creative operators. Notorious offenders included
Sternmetal, SuSAG, Blackhawk Enterprises,
SpinDevCorp/Venturprise, and Arkesh/Interglobal.
<P>
<b>Narval Controversy:</b> The destruction, by Imperial naval
forces, of the civilian settlements on this world (SM
0805) during the Third Frontier War. Narval had been
captured by Zhodani forces during the Second Frontier
War, but managed to retain its Imperial culture, and
was friendly to its new overlords.  The world's
strategic location made it a threat to Imperial
facilities and shipping in Jewell and Vilis, and its
cooperative spirit was anathema to Imperial prejudice
against the Zhodani.  An Imperial Naval strike force
simply entered the system, defeated the local system
defense, took up position in orbit, and annihilated
the civilian populace with mass drivers. This atrocity
boomeranged by outraging other Imperial culture worlds
in the disputed regions, and was instrumental in the
creation of the large demilitarised zone that has been
emplaced in Vilis and Querion since the end of that
war. Narval's surviving Imperial communities have
reconciled with their cousins in the Regency since the
Collapse, and the world is heavily visited by traders
from both states.
<P>
<b>Obeyery:</b> Amphibian alien species native to
Stave/Cronor (SM 0710). The Obeyery are 400 kilogram
bipeds with long lizard like bodies. Their culture is
very reminiscent of the Vargr:</b> a constant struggle for
dominance among individuals. Unlike the Vargr, though,
the Obeyery recognise the need for semi-permanent
leadership. The world has been unified under a "lord
protector" since late in the Antebellum period. The
Obeyery can be overbearing to offworld visitors, but
they are quite friendly and accepting to such contact.
Unfortunately they have a low level of technological
development, and few resources to trade beyond their
excellent Stave "Corn".
<P>


<B>Old Frontier:</B> The former military frontier of the
Domain of Deneb. With peace between the Regency and
the Zhodani Consulate, the paranoia and fear that
typified the people of this region, and their
foolhardy defiance, cooled down considerably.  The
local military concentrations were built down and
transferred to the Rampart to deter Virus.  Because of
their low tech levels, and a number of amenable
worlds, they became migration destinations for Regency
citizens desiring to be left alone by the wider
universe, an attitude that meshed with the locals own
laissez-faire mentality.
<P>
The exposed frontier, the presence of an implacable
enemy, and the depressed economic conditions of the
region forced self-reliance on the part of the locals,
and a deep admiration for collective institutions,
particulary the military. The admiration for the
military is evident in the lavish praise for military
heros and military valor. Most significant families
have at least one member in military service at any
given time.  Memorials to military feats and heros
dominate public spaces. Education is often slanted
towards discipline and sacrifice, and encourages
volunteerism and public service in students.
<P>
The ongoing Zhodani Exodus has rekindled the old
fears, and in some cases the worst angels of the
regions character. A debate between duty and old
animosity has emerged within some parts of Frontier
society, and sometimes it is resolved with acts of
bloodshed.
<P>


<B>Otarri:</B> Primitive amphibian alien species native to
Faldor/Plankwell. Known as "Lung Fish" to human
neighbors. The Otarri live in the massive swamps of
the main continent, and are ruled by a queen installed
for life. Despite these matriarchal tendencies, local
culture is very egalitarian. Most offworld contact
comes from Regency traders on Flammarion or Bowman.
<P>
<b>Research Station Delta:</b> Imperial research facility on
Retinae/Querion. The facility was first built in 687
with the sole purpose of studying the Tashaki and
their strange ecology. Delta consists of a specially
shielded dome structure, about 500 kilometers from the
Tashaki "capitol."  Nuclear dampers are built into its
environment plant to prevent contamination from the
highly radioactive atmosphere (which is mostly oxygen
with high amounts of Radon and other radioactive
gases).  Imperial Army engineers excavated an
extensive system of subterranean warrens under the
facility, and structurally it can withstand a direct
hit from a low yield tactical nuclear weapon or a
major earthquake.
<P>
<b>Research Station Eta:</b> Imperial research facility on
Judice/Plankwell (SM 1337). Judice has a corrosive
atmosphere with high amounts of nitric acid. Despite
this hellish environment, extremely hardy life has
begun evolving in the worlds nitric acid "seas".
Since 1103 Eta has studied these lifeforms, and
subsequent surveys showed that the local biosphere was
even more significant in extent than previously
thought. Eta has been run by Kaldi Research since
1155, and has been expanded to do research in severe
environment conditions, and fluidic research
biochemistry.
<P>

<B>Saurians:</B> Sentient, reptilian society native to
Saurus/Vilis. The slow, stone age Saurians were
overlooked by the IISS exploratory teams when the
world was first explored. Because of its T-Prime
status, the world was opened to outside colonisation
with great fanfare. And then the colonists discovered
the truth about their neighbors.  "A day late, a
credit short" the Imperial government could do little
beyond sending observers to prevent exploitation of
the suprisingly gentle creatures. In the centuries
since colonisation, the Saurians have shown a
penchance for copying human culture, having formed
simple communities copied upon the human settlements.
Many Saurians serve in the local defense forces, and
were instrumental in beating back a Sword World
incursion in 1132.
<P>

<B>Spinward Hub:</B> The convergence of the main branches of
the Spinward Main in Lunion subsector. Since the
Collapse, the term has been expanded to refer to
Lunion's crucial importance as a convergence point for
Regency finance, trade and cultural exchange. Economic
development and corporate relocation has made the
local high population worlds the information nerve
center, not only for the Regency, but for a major part
of the Spinward States in general.
<P>
The Hub is not heavily industrialised in comparison
with other regions, but the majority of its industries
are specialised to support this flow of exchange and
trade. Transportation, software and a variety of
service industries are dominant here, and seventy
percent of the Regency's banks, insurance houses, and
investment brokerages are headquarted on Lunion and
Strouden alone.

<P>
<b>Stave Corn:</b> Grain crop native to Stave/Cronor. Stave
Corn has virtually all of the major nutrients required
by carbon based lifeforms, and it is raised by the
native Obeyery race as their main export.  Stave Corn
is not like normal grain, but is actually a
bittersweet legumaceous pod that is usually roasted
before processing.  It is very popular with human
vegetarians, but is more commonly ground up and
fermented to create "Stave Whisky", a very mild yet
richly alcoholic beverage.
<P>
<B>Stronghold:</B> Name given to the rapidly developing
subsectors of Mora, Gulf/Deneb, Zeng/Deneb,
Deneb/Deneb, Vestus/Reft, Macon/Reft, the rimward
portions of Starlane and Vincennes subsectors, and
coreward Trin's Shroud.
<P>
Despite the Rape of Trin, the Rift was never a primary
vector for vampire fleets.  Even the most organised of
Puppeteer and Empire Builder viruses showed great
reluctance to cross the rift, and only a few
extraordinary groupings actually attempted the feat.
This gave the Rift the fewest, and yet the largest and
most deadly, battles of any Regency frontier.  The
relative safety of this region, combined with the
immediate effects of the ID program, had enormous
benefits for local worlds. Largely a stagnant
backwater of decrepit industrial worlds, and their
equally desperate smaller neighbors, during the
antebellum period, the flow of investment and
technical assistance created an economic boom that
hasn't shown letup since it started.
<P>
While most were late-starters in terms of
technological ability, the massive populations of
several worlds, and their attainment of at least TL
12-14 allows for massive quantitative production. But the full benefits of the IDP have not yet
been realised.
By 1215, it is estimated that Beaxon, Askigaak, Deneb,
Fornice and Pikha will all attain TL15, making the
region the premier industrial center of the Regency.
Moreover, strong local reinvestment in neighboring
worlds is beginning to bear fruit as a general
increase across the the region.  And two of its worlds
are "banging on the door" relative to TL-16 (Dekha and
Lintl).
<P>
The region originally recieved its name for its close
proximity to the Great Rift. But it is aptly named for
another reason: distance from potential or existing
crises.  While some Aslan Ihatei reached Vestus and
Gulf, for the most part the region has been free of
the major crises that have disrupted other regions
like the Rampart and the Thinrim.  Here is the only
place in the Regency one actually feels safe, with
none of the militant paranoia of the frontiers or the
festering resentments and unfinished business of the
Thinrim or Midway.
<P>
<b>Tashaki:</b> Mysterious alien species indigenous to
Retinae/Querion. A silicon based humanoid species
whose life cycle depends, as does all life on Retinae,
upon heavy amounts of radioactive materials in the
atmosphere. The entire ecology is alien to this world,
and appears to have been transplanted here around
600,000 years ago. The Tashaki do not seem to have any
individual characteristics, though no evidence exists
for a hive mind or telepathic linkage. The Tashaki
communicate through phosphorescent "eyes" on their
bodies (which is where the world takes its name) that
can be translated by computer software.
<P>
<b>Tethmari:</b> Ammonia breathing, vegetarian alien species
native to Gyomar/Cronor (SM 0108). The Tethmari are
squat creatures supported on three five toed limbs.
The front limb contains their visual, audio and
olfactory senses, and their digestive organs. Tethmari
society is divided into three sexes:</b> male, female and
Enabler. Enablers are rare but vital individuals that
handle leadership roles in their society. All members
of Tethmari society are given their place and lifelong
caste at the whims of Enablers. The Tethmari are very
friendly to offworld contact, but the cold, dense
ammonia atmosphere of their homeworld tends to
discourage visitation.
<P>
<b>Thanber Consolidated Properties:</b> Otherwise known by
its initials, TCP. Enigmatic and controversial
corporation owned by the world government of Thanber
(SM 0717). Allegations have been raised that the
company is a Minotaur with ties to several shady firms
across the Spinward/Coreward corner of the Marches,
including several tied into the Tukera family. Thanber
had strong ties with Tukera before the Civil War, and
was practically controlled by that now defunct
megacorporation. While the world had taken a beating
from the company's pullout and subsequent demise, it
has survived economically with the assistance of
former company employees, and subsidiaries spun off
during its pullout.  Regency MoJ and other government
agencies have kept TCP under close but discrete
scrutiny for years, even though the company appears to
be rather clean itself.
<P>
<B>Thinrim:</B Comprises all Regency territory in Trojan
Reach, Usher/Reft, Glisten/SM, Plankwell, the rimward
half of Trin's Shroud, and some parts of Lunion.
<P>
Once a melancholy backwater of mediocre industrial
worlds catering to trade with the Aslan, the Thinrim
has risen to being second only to the Stronghold in
population and technology.  This despite the heavy
Ihatei invasions that overran much of it in the period
of 1119-1122.  The fait accompli arrangements of the
Spinward Accords left many of its worlds in the
control of Aslan clans, most of whom imposed their own
culture upon the local populations, and were
ambivalent in serving the Regency.  Despite the
simmering tensions with the Aslan, the common cause of
Virus, and the need for a secure rear area away from
the trailing frontier, compelled the local populations
to adopt a "live-and-let-live" attitude of balancing
their grievances against grim necessity.  This has not
prevented occasional confrontations on mixed
population worlds, and it does little for fait
accompli worlds.
<P>
Thinrim worlds show the evidence of past crises.
During the Ihatei invasions, large numbers of people
were uprooted, and replaced by Aslan.  When the
Collapse occured, most of these people returned,
joined by refugees and economic settlers in the
billions. Most worlds, then, are a mixture of
dilapidated older settlements, and a crazy-quilt of
Collapse era temporary settlements that look as if
they were erected yesterday, yet contain the bulk of
the population.  In spite of this, or perhaps because
of it, the dividing line between ghettos and upscale
neighborhoods are obliterated, and human and Aslan
communities are rather well integrated on liberated
worlds.
<P>
Many of the Thinrim's goods are destined for the Aslan
Remnants and its maintenance of the Riftspan
Quarantine. There is much irony in this.  The Aslan
Rift Territories contain only a few industrial worlds,
and the Collapse left the region with little
technological depth compared to the Regency.  Despite
the Ihatei invasions, the fait accompli settlements,
and the accomodations of the Spinward Accords, the
Regency now holds the advantage. Industrial dependence
became an effective means of controlling Aslan
aggression, and deterring material support to fait
accompli rulers.
<P>

<B>"Tucked in like a Tukera":</B> Colloquial phrase common to
the old Imperium. Literally means to enjoy a position
of power and wealth based upon nepotism and cronyism.
The phrase is inspired by the antebellum exploits of
the wide ranging Tukera family, owners of the Tukera
Megacorporation.
<P>
<B>Tukera Family:</B The descendants of the ancient founders
of the now deceased Tukera Megacorporation. The
Tukera's were especially given to nepotism, both to
further the companies success and to keep a tight hand
of control over its dispersed operations. Wherever
Tukera operated, at least a minor cadet branch of the
family was represented in some numbers.
<P>
In the Domain of Deneb, the family was represented by
the Marquis of Aramis in the Spinward Marches, and the
Duke of Star Lane in Deneb.  The Civil War and
Collapse took a very heavy toll of both the BTC
Tukera's. The company withdrew from the Domain in
1124, leaving the local branches stranded. The
Collapse destroyed the company proper, leaving the
survivors with a mountain of debts and handfuls of now
worthless stock certificates. But to their great
credit, and political skill, the family has managed to
survive its adversities, and the Aramis Tukeras have
even regained most of their prosperity.
<P>
<B>Ursty:</B> Sentient, octopoid species native to
Yurst/Regina. The Ursty are 80 kilogram omnivores
native to Yursts shallow oceans, possessing a
"bioculutre" technology that manipulates other oceanic
species to their bidding. While they were full
Imperial citizens, Yurst's high chlorine content
atmosphere discouraged offworld contact beyond a few
visiting academics and government researchers. The
Ursty possess seven tentacles, six for use and one for
mating display, and three compound eyes.

<P>
<b>Xebec:</b> Shipbuilder headquartered on Lanth. Xebec
produces mostly 1,000 to 10,000 ton modular "barges"
for the Spinward Marches starship market, but also
produces a number of smaller budget ships for the
independent market. Most of its ships are produced on
Lanth proper, but the company has recently purchased
plant on Karin/Five Sisters and Mongo/Jewell.  Xebec
is most famous for its namesake class, a unique
"telescoping" 150-330 ton modular merchant that can be
expanded to accomodate various cargo sizes without
compromising its profitability.
