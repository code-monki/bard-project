Well-informed circles announce troop shifting to Fija and Aurora. Ten Oriflamman (TL-9/10) and three Auroran (TL-12) divisions have orders to Aurora. Special operation teams of the RCN and the RCES practice small group combat missions on Atrase and Buhle.
<P>
CDRE Sean "Hammer" Lathrop of RCES & CDRE J .N. Sayani, were in closed briefings with starship captains of the gathering RCN & RCES & Star Merc forces of BG Cori Sterns. Word has leaked that the Coalition will be putting forth its largest Decapitation operation to Date. Spokesperson for the Navy, LTCDR Ibrihim Humbria, stated briefly to the press, " We're going to break the back of the Promise subsector Vampire Network, plain and simple, once and for all." In Orbit were noted both Class IV Maggart class Clippers, RCNS Maggart & RCNS Karlsruhe, The Fijian "Grey Ghost" Fighter Squadron (comprised of three dozen TL-15 Rampart light Ftrs), the Class III Aurora Clippers, RCNS Thunderchild, RCNS Firelord, RCNS Argent, RCNS Balder, & RCNS Ra, each equipped with 3x Battle Riding Manticore class LBRs. Also making their debut was the 6kton Frigates RCNS Fusilier, & RCNS Rifleman, (N-PAW armed) with a 1kton Oases fueler (carried), and the 6kton Frigates RCNS Lancer, RCNS Hussar (Meson armed) also equipped with a 1kton Oases fueler. Three of the RCN's six Pathfinder Scouts have been tasked to this effort as well.
<P>
Neither of the surviving Class II Aurora clippers (RCNS Apollo, RCNS Aube) was seen in evidence. Sources close to the RCN-RCES commanders revealed these are re-assigned to the ongoing Coreward RC Navy efforts versus Solee, along with the (Class III) RCNS Immanuel Kant, RCNS Helios & their Manticore LBR squadrons. By comparison to the larger ships, only four Victrix class sloops, RCS Norfolk-Victrix, Schalli-Victrix, Balduri-Victrix, and Eos-Victrix were detailed to this armada, as the bulk of these too, have been assigned to the Shenk-Thoezennt front lines, as have the remaining four Frigates & their fuelers.
<P>
Fija's own transport & freight based Transstar, LCC has re-assigned it's three newly refitted 1kton BUFF class freighters, TSS Mothra, and TSS Rodan to the effort for support, under the emergency War Powers act voluntarily. TSS Gamera is in support of the Shenk-Thoezennt RCN fleet efforts. Transstar's [TL-12] Tasadian class Freight-hauler, the 3 kton TSS Grappler, has also be placed at the RCN's service, ostensibly as a bulk carrier of 4x Jackal Class SDB's recovered from Lote to be deployed as LBRs, as well as acting as a Fleet munitions Dromedary/ Tanker. Baldur's HTTC Corp has leased out both of its heavily armed 20 kton Athenian class Colony ships, BCS Revival, & BCS Resurrection to supplement the recently completed RCN troop vessels RCNS Leviathan & RCNS Ymir. The Salvage & Trade company, Jumping-Jack-Flash Interstellar Salvage, & Mercantile, LTD, has leased the 3 kton Tethys-class Mercenary Troop ship RCNSR Hephaestus Hammer, Trenchant Patrol cruiser RCSNR Osprey, CE, RCNSR Green Hornet, to the imminent Decapitation strike.
RC Naval & Coalition Exploratory Scout Reservists of the company are manning their own vessels. RCES & Starmerc/ 'Lancer' Support from BG Cori Sterns' Battle Angels; The Templars, under former FM Oskar Kelkon; Lancer Special Boat Service, commanded by COL. Thomas Ahearns .The Battle Angels came in the Broadsword-Mercenary cruiser class squadron, SMS Patuxuent, SMS Caloosahatchee, SMS Missinewa, the EMMC Admiral Bertil class ships RCSNR Nec Aspera Terrent, RCSNR Admiral Bertil-II, RCSNR Vigilante-II, & RCSNR Angor Wat; The So Skire based Templars brought their two Trenchant-class Patrol Cruisers, the RCMS Bloodhound & RCMS Relentless, and a Fer-de-Lance Destroyer Escort, RCMS Mjolnir; The Lancer based Special Boat Service Commandoes and their small-craft will be tasked to the JJFIS&M, Ltd reservist vessels, RCNSR Hephaestus Hammer, RCSNR Osprey, and RCNSR Green Hornet.

The RCS Belladonna came out of Jump like a majestic eagle, and into the Aubaine evening skies like a graceful Swan, escorting the DLS Lady Elise Modified Exploratory ship. Captain Joseph "Peg-leg" Bligh, commanding, brought her into Brusman Downport himself, at the helm.
<P>
Coalition Megacorp & corporate diplomats were making insystem calls on their perscomms as Belladonna swooped into view, with the electrifying news of purchase of the Anti-Virus weapon called "Snake" from our new allied stellar polity, the Covenant of Sufren.
<P>
"Take good care of her boys!" CPT Bligh said to the "Yard Dogs" of Navy Maintenance. "She did us good work, and we've come safe home." CPT Bligh declined comment. Observant reporters noted the not-so-secret cargo of Snake Anti-virus weapons were downloaded in orbit and were stored at the Aubani High port naval base. Courier ship RCS Balthasar-Victrix was dispatched towards the gathering fleet elements spinward.

The electrically tragic news of the assassination of Mueller's Foreign Minister Karl von Ahrtal three weeks ago, was brightened by the heroic rescue of his wife and two children, Christina, Anya, and Karl Jr. by the RCNRS Green Hornet, recently completing its annual maintenance at Nike's yards. The Muelleran ship, a stretched Petty-class Fat Trader has been repaired. Three small armed freighters, two apparently having been in-system prior to the FM's departure according to RCN Naval Intelligence Officer, CDR Chelsea Bain, ambushed the FMS Freiburg as it approached jump speed near the Coreward vector Jump point. One of these two heavily armed Stretch-modified Jayhawk-class Far Traders (300dtns each) was destroyed by the Green Hornet, the second, the SMGS In for A Penny was taken prisoner by then approaching Nimban insystem patrol craft. The third ship, which had done the firing, amassed 800dtns according to both Nimban Navy & RCN sources, and gave its name as the SMGS Burnt Land. This raider is on the RCES/RCN watch list. It jumped away, as the Hornet approached, leaving its smaller kin behind.
<P>
FM von Ahrtal had been visiting the Coalition in clandestine talks, his family accompanying him, an anonymous RCSA official admitted. Apparently his security wasn't as tight as was thought. The Foreign Minister's body, & his family members were transported back to Mueller with full military honors, aboard the RCS Apollo, CPT Rebekka Guiterrez, commanding.

<P>
The RCS Eos-Victrix returned to port, reporting that the spinward operation was finished with Phase I, securing the planet Execute (2930/Promise, E-684577-5), and successful destroyed the Vampire ship "Influence Agori" and its minions on the starport below. Eos-Victrix received minor damage from the infected Donosev-class Survey class vessel closing to board her, and is here getting a turret replaced and minor hull damage, RCES spokesmen who declined to be identified said. It was leaked that the TF-Free Promise was in place at Gorky (2929/Promise X-200000-0) after having secured the system, catching several small vampire ships unawares. From initial reports, it seems the AVV weapon "SNAKE" is all it's cracked up to be. Eos-Victrix is expected to return to the "front" in a matter of days.

<P>
The BUFF-class freighters TSS Rodan and TSS Mothra made port today, reporting the successful sweep of the Promise system's two gas giants by RCN-RCES, and Lancer ships. They were bringing back wounded and fetching supplies for the intense fighting planet side. CINET reporter Gabriela Diabla, twice Nimban Silver Palm winner laid out the scoop on the invasion as it goes so far, from dispatches from the field from her prot�g�' Gabrielle Potter (recently returned from the Covenant of Sufren).
<P>
"Four weeks ago (07/X/1202) "TF-Free Promise" entered the Promise system, and secured the Two gas giants before proceeding towards the main world itself. This mission was accomplished by the deployment of the Manticore BR squadrons from RCNS Thunderchild & RCNS Firelord. Two vampire ships were intercepted at the near gas giant, attacked, disabled and swept clean of Virus using "SNAKE".
<P>
"Through coordinated efforts on the ground with human resistance, known as the "Black January Brigade", cadre elements of the Battle Angels Star Mercs under LTC Hamling, and an RCN Forward Observer Team led by CDR Saffron Ghulz, seized control of the Planetary Defense complex of Star City (Promise's capital), and cleared the orbit of some 20-30 Vampire ships with meson fire and PAD missiles."
<P>
"The Landings went as scheduled: drop troops from the 1st RCMC secured the C-class Downport with minimum damage to the facility, but took heavy fire from the robots and human cohorts there; the Battle Angels drop troops landed unopposed and secured the perimeter around the CCP of the PAD launch complex; Templar Star troops also landed unopposed to the west of the Starport, and linked up with the 1st RCMC after defeating a Virus led human troop strongpoint, just outside the NW corner of the starport. By 1200hrs, the bridgehead was secured, and the enemy had yet (besides those directly attacked at the Starport) to acknowledge they were under attack, so self-absorbed they were in their own civil war."
"Armor from the 2nd Armored Regt. ("All Hell's A'Poppin") of the Nimban Army in their Trepida II/120's, entered orbit unopposed, and quickly encircled the city by 1300hrs. Balduri Marine & Oriflamme Army elements were landed at the secured starport disgorging from the BCS Revival & BCS Resurrection that landed at the captured Downport. Close Air Support (CAS) was provided by The Grey-Ghost Fighter Squadron of Fija, that destroyed an enemy armored vehicle counterattack late in the afternoon of some 30-40 AFV's." The Oriflamme famed 3rd Armored Infantry (Marines) regiment, AKA THE THIRD, pushed deep into the city, and stormed the City complexes of the Virus data system known as "Finance", three km north of the starport.
It was also reported that Coalition forces set up a modular base and a battery of PAD missiles on the nearby moon of Promise, "Rivera", using a Haven-modular spaceport carried by the freight-tractor TSS Grappler. This (was done) in case of a sneak attack by inbound vampires using the moons sensor shadow as a blind to pounce upon the vulnerable Orbital beachhead. In orbit, Lancer Special Boat Service forces under Coalition-command on the reservist ships RCNRS Hephaestus Hammer, RCNSR Osprey, and RCNSR Green Hornet were engaged in Ship to ship boarding operations of the crippled Vampires from the PAD surprise attack. EPWs were transferred to a holding camp erected south of the starport for these poor "Dave's", and SNAKE was used to flush the Prizes clean of Virus.
<P>
Throughout the first day's landings, the Star Merc ships of the Battle Angels, the EMMC Admiral Bertil class ships RCSNR Nec Aspera Terrent, RCSNR Admiral Bertil-II, RCSNR Vigilante-II, & RCSNR Angor Wat airlifted in the main body of rebel forces from Freedom lake, where they had been gathered months ago, armed and equipped with small arms and training for this day, and attacked the High complexes on the west side of the city, landing on the roof tops, working their way downwards.

<B>COALINFONET, CLASS: <B>NEWSREPORT</B>, DISTRIBUTION: PUSH, AUTHORITY CIN/FIJA RCES HQ FIJA/AUBAINE (0434 D553754-A), 09/XI/ 1202 KEYWORDS: ELOJI/PROMISE, SAG RAID, TF-"SHOOTING-STAR" RCS ALARM, RCS DEFIANT ARMS, RCS ARGENT SUCCESSFUL; </b><BR>reported by <A  HREF="../../credits.html#Devlin">Liam Devlin</A><p>.
<P>
In a side operation to Eloji (2728/Promise D-846644-8 Ni Ag) was part of a targeting operation to prevent further nuclear world war with a SAG raid conducted by the three ship "TF-Shooting Star", consisting of the Pathfinder-MM class Scouts RCS Alarm, & RCS Defiant Arms, and converted Armed Bastien class liner, RCS Argent. All but RCS Alarm returned to port yesterday, lost to enemy PAD missiles, though most of the crew was rescued by a daring dash to the surface by CPT Horace "Tea-Time" Titan of Oriflamme, in the RCS Defiant Arms. RCES, RCMC, RCN personnel successfully raided Colonel Boukart's PAD main missile complex, and withdrew in good order after removing all of the relic TL-12 X-ray-nuke warheads. Among the rescued, CPT Illyria "Razbak" Razzori of Lucifer, and three of her crew who were also wounded in their crash-landing. Mission chief, CPT Rocky "Rocko" Spaeder was removed for cause by a hastily assembled RCES/RCN Naval board of inquiry.
"Nothing super scandalous," RCN Spokesman Ibrihim Humbria reported to CINET. "He panicked and froze when the Alarm was shot down. CPT Titan displayed verve and extreme heroism as well as presence of mind, and recovered our people. CPT Spaeder voluntarily resigned, he'll be more at ease crewing an RC merchant man, well away from hostile fires."

<P>
The TSS Grappler made port today bearing back half a dozen damaged ships bound for recovery & refit yards at Trybec & Aurora. News from Promise, carried in Vid-dispatches from Ms Potter updated headlines today, and was packaged for redistribution in the RC. The following are edited & compressed for clarity, and chronology.
<P>
""D-Day+2, The Star City has been cut in half, and the West Side Towers have been cleared of all hostile forces, human & robotic. Black January Forces confirm that the sentient system known as forces of another sentient system known as Nolodyn destroyed GroSec. Nolodyn was destroyed by one of the ships in orbit that the rebels in control of PADCom seized two days ago, and sent plummeting into the Halcyon Sea, south of the city. Both of these two systems' loyal bots & AFVs are still waging their own vendettas against one another and anyone who crosses them. The system known as "Downport" was destroyed by 1st RCMC troops on D-Day, & the sentient system "Finance" was taken out by THE THIRD. All of this good news was drowned by the news that all but the Lancer ships had jumped out of system. Hope they comeback."
<P>
" D-day+3-4: The heaviest fighting seen yet to date, The refugee camp of humans fleeing the city just south of the starport has swollen to some 35,000 wretched families and individuals, flushed out by both RC and Sentient forces. Nimban Army MASH unit 407th says they're pretty well stocked for supplies, but the fresh water issue is a problem unless the City's Power & Light system gets repaired soon. Most are suffering from malnutrition and dehydration. THE THIRD lost a Platoon of Gladiator MK III Grav Tanks to a pair of dug in Solomani-built Energia Air-cushion tanks before Orbital strike missiles killed these robotic AFVs. Elsewhere in the city, three Templar Cohort-APC's were destroyed when twenty children rushed them, and detonated the shaped charges they had beneath their robes.
The Templars machine-gunned any red robed humans they spotted thereafter.
<P>
The sentient system known as "TrafficNet" restored its sensors and attempted to launch its six batteries of four launchers each of TL-13 PAD missiles just after dawn, but found itself overrun with Battle Angel & Special Boat service Commandoes that had infiltrated the heating tunnels and sewers. SNAKE made five minutes worth of work of it, and the threat to the orbiting Lancer ships passed.
The big attack came near dusk, the city choked with smoke from burning buildings, robotic vehicles, robots, and debris deliberately set by their human janissaries. Over a hundred armored robotic fighting vehicles counterattacked through the corridor of the central highway, with some 2000 armed robots, and 150 Breeds in an attempt to break through to the West side near the Census sentient system's defensive pocket. Enemy mortar fire was intense, and the Nimban & THIRD's armored vehicles entered the fray that lasted till an hour before dawn. Fighting got down to hand-to-hand with the Cyborg breeds with the THIRD's dismounts. Visibility was down to mere yards. The final charge was stopped by the THIRD's organic MRLS battery raining 20cm HEAP rockets into the enemy advance.
<P>
At dawn, the exhausted THIRD and Nimban 2nd Armored Regt.s counted 11destroyed sentient Trepida Grav tanks, 44 Pyrrhus grav sleds, and 68 Energia Air cushion-Tanks, as well as over a thousand armed robots. The Cyborg-breeds were annihilated. Coalition losses were five Trepida II/120's of the Nimban 2nd Armored, and twenty-six TL-9 AFV's and crews of the THIRD. But the cordon held, and saw the end of GroSec's forces in Star City. The THIRD suffered nearly 300 killed, a fifth of their number holding the line. Nimban Army AT & infantry support troop casualties numbered some 268 killed and 38 missing.
"D-Day+5: There was good news today, the forces of the sentient system "Census" surrendered today, and stood down. Some 1700 security Robots, two hundred TL-9 human troops, and 40,000 "militia" with spears, swords and longbows flew the white flag. Fire Support Commander CDR Ghulz and leaders of the Black January Brigade resistance accepted their surrender. They were out of ammunition, power, food, and water.
<P>
On the East Side, the Templars moved ahead of the THIRD, and stormed the MedCom plaza, armed with Auto grenade launchers, combat shotguns, and flame-throwers. Some 200 Security robots were destroyed, and close to 700 cyborgs as well. 1company of Templars perished in the assault. Mopping up pockets of resistance is tomorrow's agenda. The once-great Sentient Council is overthrown!"
<P>
"D-Day +6: Somehow, the City's Light gas & Power have been restored. CDR Ghulz tells me, "It's a small thing actually. Just good Oriflamman Navy-Know-how." It does bring relief to the nearly 70,000 humans swelling the camp south of the Starport. Several run ins with armed gunbots happened over in North side, fusion gunned with tracks. Not imperial designs, something machine-like orchestrated those. The Templars are securing the area, using lots of explosives. My city-guide, a resistance lady named "Karla 214", tells me that there are several dozen underground manufacturing sites in the city, most were used by the "Trogs" as she calls em. Feral folk who preyed on other humans, reduced to thievery, or worse, cannibalism. Some of the robots it looks like were on the side of the humans. I talked with one, named Sebastian, used to work for CeeWaLP system, the one who ran the Power light and gas. Odd talking to a machine that talks back. Several Black January folk had to shove a few gun-happy Templars off away from him. They spat at him, at us. "Only good Virus, is a dead, 'un," the one in charge growled. This doesn't look good."
<P>
 D-Day +12, "The city's coming back to some semblance of life. Parts of the Fleet returned today. Seems they made landings on Eloji & Exeter while we were here. Hope Somebody's covering those! The Templars jumped from system today to go hunt & sweep the main for straggler Vampire ships. Seems they've made a bad name for themselves here with the locals & CDRE Ghulz gave em the boot with CPT Ritter's blessing. Seen a lot more of the Freed-bots as they call themselves. Some were working on a few RCN reserve ships, and patching up the prize ships for passage home. Karla 214 says "Sandman" & his "children" are cooperating fully with the occupation forces. Weird, a few days ago we were trying to kill them off."
