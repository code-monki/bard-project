<H1>Pre-Industrial Military Careers</H1>

<H5>by <A HREF="../../credits.html#Cain">Franklin W. Cain</A></H5>

</CENTER>

<HR>
   I am "assuming"  that there isn't one specific skill that handles
black powder cannons.  (If I am wrong, *please* direct me to the proper
reference in TNE!)  For now, I am handling this as a "combined" skill
attempt with Archaic Artillery *and* Early Firearms, *both* of which are
available to Pre-Industrial Tech worlds.  (All skills in the "Heavy
Weapons" cluster require a Tech of "Ind+".)  <P>
 
 I am using "Ground" Tactics to cover any and all military situations
happening on a planetary surface, whether land or sea.  Naval Tactics (Ship
Tactics & Fleet Tactics) apply *only* to 3-dimensional space.  <P>
