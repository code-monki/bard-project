<h1>Vacuum Behind the Claw</h1>

<H5>by <A HREF="../../credits.html#Pete">Pete Gray</A></H5>

</CENTER>
<HR> After some close rereading of <Cite>Regency Sourcebook</cite>, I've come to the
conclusion that the most likely conflict in the wake
of the Zhodani collapse will be between the Regency
and the Aslan Hierate.
<P>
While it is true that the Zhodani collapse will create
conflict among the human client states, it is unlikely
that these wars will spread beyond Far Frontiers or
Yiklerzdanzh sectors.  And whatever attempts will be
made at poaching on Zhodani territory will be
accomplished by the client states attempting to curry
favor and influence among Zhodani factions, rather
than wasting their troops on a headlong assualt.
<P>
The Regency-Aslan conflict is a leftover from the fait
accompli of 1132.  The fait accompli worlds are
controlled by traditional Aslan governments looking
for an excuse to break away from the Regency.  And
most of their Hierate clansman are not content with
the current status quo, either.  The Hierate bears
reluctance towards reclaiming former homelands,
because it is easier to claim developed worlds than it
is to rebuild their old ones from scratch?  Whatever
the reasons, the more hot-headed clans, remembering
their previous successes against the old Domain, will
argue vehemently that the collapse of Zhodani power
gives the Hierate an oppurtunity to become the
preeminent power behind the claw.
<P>
Their argument is that the Regency has a divided
attention, much as it did in 1119, spending most of
their efforts and time concentrating on the Quarantine
to trailing.  Their assertion is that the conditions
for a successful war are even more ripe now than they
were in 1119, since they no longer have to fear the
Regency possibly allying itself with any other Impi
faction or the Consulate.  Many of the Fait Accompli
worlds are located beyond the extent of Aslan control
before 1131; since few of these worlds have contigous
links with the Hierate, their independence makes it
necessary for surrounding worlds to be captured as
well, giving Aslan more territory than they did before
the Collapse. With the Regency still chained to their
precious Quarantine, the Aslan can recreate the
strategy that brought them so much success before.
The Regency will have a catch-22 choice between
accepting further Aslan claims, or by neglecting the
Quarantine and pursuing a war.  And the Aslan are
happy with either outcome, as they don't have the
numbers of ihatei they did before, but they now have a
lot more military assets on this side of the Rift.
<P>
So from 1203 onwards, Aslan on fait accompli worlds
will attempt to provoke the Regency government into
exceeding or undermining its authority.  They'll begin
to import large numbers of their clansmen as the
manpower for a successful rebellion, and to provide
the first waves for invasion of neighboring worlds.
<P>
What will suprise the Hierate, however, is that they
that this war will be a disaster.  Because the Hierate
is misreading the Regency.  This isn't 1119, and this
isn't the Domain of Deneb anymore.  In fact the
Consulate's collapse will free the Regency as much as
it will the Hierate.  And even more to the cats'
dismay, their enemies have been waiting and preparing
for this eventuality.
<P>

The Regency has decieved its neighbors about the
nature of its predicament and its objectives.  The
armed neutrality that it pursued made the job easier.
In the game of credibility, your enemies perception of
your strength is your best weapon.  Your real strength
is less important, and therefore more easily
conserved, than the impression of strength you create.
<P>
The real reason for the Spinward Accords, then, was to
buy time for the Regency.  Their real objective is the
military reconquest and economic recovery of the
former Imperium, and they will allow nothing to
interfere with that goal.  Consequently, the Regency
has been in an extended military build-up since the
late 1120's that dwarfs even Lucan's faction in size
and potency. In the 1130s the Regency was vulnerable
to an invasion of its borders, and the detente with
Zhodane was important solely for deterring Aslan
aggression; otherwise the Regency was well aware that
the Consulates problems and the Regency's real
objectives made them unreliable allies.
<P>
And the Regency used Aslan aggression as a lever
against the Zhodani and the Human client states. On
it's own, such divide and conquer neutrality would
have eventually collapsed; at some point the Regency
would not find an ally to align themselves with. But
as long as Virus was a threat, the Regency had a lever
against predatory warfare BTC.  In fact, Virus has
been their main ally. Neutrality had another silver
lining: it kept the military from squandering
resources and manpower on sideshow operations among
their neighbors.
<P>
Hidden within this careful diplomacy was the
acceptance that eventually one or more of the Spinward
States would drop pretensions, and war would be
unavoidable.  The Regency has prepared for a war with
the Aslan since the Accords signing, if only as a
contingency.  But without the Zhodani card to play
anymore, the likelihood of war is very high.  When
Norris said in the 1120s (MTJ2 if I remember right)
that a military solution was too simple, he meant that
the Domain didn't have then the military and
diplomatic resources to win such a conflict.  That is
no longer the case. The Regency can now fight a two
front war against both trailing threats and an Aslan
invasion with equal aplomb.
<P>
The Regency wanted to concentrate on its war effort,
and so it played the weakling, threatening to align
with this power against that power.  The Aslan, then,
have a distorted view of their chance for military
success. And while it seems to them that they have the
initiative for starting a war, the Regency understands
Firukhte quite well, and may actually be using their
feigned weakness as a means of subtly provoking their
neighbors into waging a war of aggression so they can
decisively slap them down once and for all.
<P>
The Regency has a number of reasons for prosecuting a
war against the Aslan.
<P>
First there's territorial integrity, and the
elimination of the fait accompli governments. The
Regency wants to reunite its citizens on those worlds
with the fellows, and perhaps lower Aslan cultural
chauvinism a peg or two.
<P>
Secondly, the Regency wants the Tlaukhu to concentrate
ONLY upon reclaiming their former territories across
the Rift; the current council is composed of Aslan
more interested in defending or extending their
possessions within the former Colonies and its
surrounds.
<P>
Thirdly, the eviction of the Tlaukhu eliminates a
dangerous nuisance BTC, preventing mischief when the
Regency begins moving the bulk of its forces into the
Imperial Wilds.  The Regency doesn't want Aslan
invasions into the former Consulate and its sphere, or
any other territory, in their absence.
<P>
Fourthly, a military defeat will finally inject some
humility into the Hierate.  The Aslan have never been
emphatically rejected by a neighbor or enemy, having
historically few opponents with the means to resist
their power.  It would be good for the Aslan to learn
that there are limits to their power, and that using
other species property and land to solve their ihatei
problem invites retaliation from its current owners.
<P>
Finally, the Regency wants to create a lasting
diplomatic covenant between Hierate and the Fiyfiyalr,
making the Tlaukhu extend the Peace of Ftahalr to ALL
Aslan clans, not just those few that existed back then
to sign it.
