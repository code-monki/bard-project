<h1> Regency Fleet List</h1>

<H5>by <A HREF="../../credits.html#Pete">Pete Gray</A></H5>

</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
This is the complete fleet list for the Regency of
Deneb as of 90-1202. Each fleet is listed in numerical
order, along with its unit nickname and area of
responsibility:</B>
<P><B>
2nd Experimental (Gizmos and Black Smoke):</B> T&E fleet
that operates the Spinward Defense Complex in
Gulf/Deneb. Headquartered at Saguenay/Gulf.
<P><B>
11th Communications (Smoke Signals):</B> Diplomatic
communication fleet. The 11th controls all diplomatic
and military couriers that operate within Zhodani,
Vargr, Aslan or Non-Aligned space. Headquartered at
Iderati/Five Sisters.
<P><B>
12th Communications (Corvine Shadow):</B> Spinward Marches
communication fleet. Headquarterd at Strouden/Lunion.
It AOR overlaps with the 319th.
<P><B>
18th (The Great Wall):</B> Lanth/Spinward Marches. Unlike
most of the Regency's fleets, the 18th is content with
its job of manning and defending interior
communication and infrastructure. Lanth has always
been an important crossroads subsector, and the 18th
primary mission is defensive patrols and maintenance
of supply depots and naval bases needed to move
reserves to trouble spots on the frontier. Because of
the challenge of operating in the Abyss, nearly all of
the fleets ships have a minimum of jump 3. Many of the
ships operated by Reft frontier fleets are used by the
18th exclusively at the expense of heavier but shorter
ranged battleships.
<P><B>
19th (Tsunami):</B> Vestus/Reft. This fleet is heavily
involved in frontline military operations against
Virus. Because of its access to TL-15 and 16 material
coming out of Lintl's factories, the fleet often tries
out new military hardware on forays into the Great
Rift or the Wilds. The Tsunami gets its name from the
sheer heaviness of its units; while most Regency
fleets have doubled in size since the Collapse, the
19th has an unprecedented 20 BatRons in unmixed
squadrons, as opposed to the more common mixed
LineRons, the current norm for the Regency Navy. The
reason for this heavy makeup has never been explained,
though a large number of heavy capital units pass
quickly to other fleets, so it may be a primary
training and shakeout facility. Given the fleets close
proximity to the Spinward Defense Complex, this seems
likely.
<P><B>
23rd (Axemen):</B> Rhylanor/Spinward Marches. The Rhylanor
subsector fleet recieved its moniker during the Fifth
Frontier War for its actions in helping cut off the
main Zhodani salient. Like most interior fleets, the
23rd is largely defensive in equipment and tactics,
though in this case it has a large number of vital
industrial worlds in its area of responsibility.
Because of its fame and prestige, and the generous
outpouring of material from Rhylanor itself, the fleet
is almost never wanting in terms of material and
supplies. Compared to most naval fleets, the Axemen
are mostly composed to lighter LinRons, preferring to
concentrate their battleships in unmixed BatRons near
high population worlds, a result of several Viral near
misses in the past (see Regency Sourcebook Referees
Section).
<P><B>
43rd (Fulcrum):</B> Lunion/Spinward Marches. The "Hub"
fleet of the Regency has a mission similiar to the
18ths, made more critical by its protection of the
crucial shipyards and supply resource worlds of Lunion
and Strouden. In Antebellum times the Fulcrum recieved
first pick of brand new warships, but now most of the
local naval consignments go to Frontier fleets, and it
must make do with lovingly maintained hand-me-downs.
Besides defense, the fleet backstops the 151st, and
maintains surveillance against Sword Worlder guerillas
and smugglers.
<P><B>
55th (Roughriders):</B> Deneb Swing. The 55th is most
famous for its timely arrival in Pretoria subsector
during the Battle of Ashes. Its forces reinforced the
overstretched 194th and 61st fleets in their battle
against invading forces of the Assemblage of 1116, and
the combined force crushed the invaders decisively.
The ragged, improvised manner in which the 55th made
its way to the battlefront, and the expert way it
regrouped and turned out for battle, earned it its
name.<P><B>

61st (Ericsson's Rocs):</B> RQD 3. Headquartered at
Uramid/Antra. Fleet name comes from its early Collapse
period commander, Admiral Arabella von Ericson, a
Fifth Frontier War veteran and hero. Ericson commanded
a starmerc organisation of the same name during the
Civil War period, that was inducted into the 61st and
became a nucleus of resistance against Virus intrusion
from the Vargr Extents. The fleets length of continous
service is one of the longest in the Regency, having
faced Vargr during the entire Civil War period, and
then fighting a mixture of Vargr corsairs and Vampire
Fleets during the Dreamtime.  And because of the
variety of enemies it has had to face, its casualty
rate is the highest in the Regency Navy.
<P><B>
73rd (Regent's Guard):</B> Mora/Spinward Marches. The
storied 73rd Fleet protects Mora and the Regency
government. It is often considered to be the last line
of defense in case of a Viral breakthrough on the
Frontier. It is not the most elite of all the fleets
however, as the Frontier gets first pick on promising
personnel. The Guard is at most above average, though
it gets first pick of new TL-16 ships and material,
and is a showcase for Regency military technology. The
fleet is more sedentary, spending much of its time in
fixed positions as sentries over Mora and the other
high population worlds of the subsector.
<P><B>
74th (Nightriders):</B> RQD 5 and Macon/Reft. Heavily
engaged in fighting Vampires that cross the Rift from
trailing Reft sector, or from Corridor. Like most
frontier fleets, the Riders have more squadrons than
the norm, but the problems of operations in the Rift
means less emphasis is placed on heavy capitol ships.
Most emphasis is placed on slower high jump vessels
like the Anchorage, Black Prince and Kishikhaniir
class cruisers than fast battleships, as well as
battle riders on smaller tenders.
<P><B>
77th (Lucky Dice):</B> Trojan Reach/Reft Training Fleet.
Headquartered at Peridot/Gazulin.
<P><B>
88th (Eight Ball):</B> Spinward Marches Swing. The
Spinward Marches Swing Fleet is based in Lanth
Subsector, but its past deployments have mostly
carried it into the Midway to back up fleets summoned
to fight Vampire incursions. Recently a couple of
lighter LinRons have been deployed to the Zhodani
interface to assist in refugee relief, and several
more squadrons have been put on alert for future
deployment. The fleets name reflects the dreary
assignments it has recieved since the Collapse, as its
interior position and the relative calm of the
spinward border since 1132 has prevented it from
seeing much action.
<P><B>
99th (Aledon's Aerie):</B> Spinward Marches Training. The
Aerie maintains its headquarters at Mora/Mora, and has
training facilities scattered around the Marches.
<P><B>
100th (Centurions):</B> Glisten/Spinward Marches. The
Centurions have a short history, only dating back to
the halcyon final months of the Fifth Frontier War. A
heavy Aslan presence in Glisten, and the existence of
several human insurgencies on fait accompli worlds
challenges its credibility and obedience on a daily
basis. Diplomacy is stressed over aggressive military
response, an attitude that grates upon personnel still
smarting over the bloody suppression of the Thinrim
Riots in the 1160s. Tensions with the Aslan have risen
in recent years, and personnel turnover is among the
heaviest in the Regency Navy. As compensation, the
100th recieves first pick of TL-16 material coming out
of naval yards not only on Glisten, but Lunion and
Strouden as well, though this may backfire against the
Aslan should hostilities erupt as many analysts fear.
<P><B>
125th (Karmic Yeomanry):</B> Namidshur/Deneb. The 125th
backs up the 183rd in the Frontier, and its forces
have been called upon many times to assist their
neighbors in fighting Vampire incursions.  Namidshur
was a largely backwater subsector previous to the
Civil War and Virus, and its infrastructure and local
institutions were less than able in absorbing large
numbers of Human and Vargr refugees. The 125th has
played a major role in providing shelter and security
for both refugees and their adopted homeworlds,
creating a strong bond between local civilian
communities and the fleets personnel. In return for
this strong support, 125th units are often fanatical
in their defense of local worlds against pirates and
Vampire Ships.
<P><B>
128th (Ancient Mariners):</B> RQD 5A and Usher/Reft.
Defending Usher subsector and the vast region of RQD
5A, it has been the 128th's lot to defend against most
Vampire incursions into the Rift, and at the same time
maintain the peace within the Islands. Like the 74th,
the 128th is a larger but lighter squadron. Most of
its ships are craft like the Kishikhaniir Rift Cruiser
(CJ-15) which sacrifice acceleration for long
endurance. Most of the fleets units are centered in
the Islands, and its personnel have generally better
relations with the locals than the local RQS cadres.
Where the Rocks are concerned with defending the
Regency safe against Islander perfidy, the Islands are
the main responsibility of the Ancient Mariners, and
they are less judgemental of their charges.
<P><B>
151st (The Old Ironclads):</B> Sword World/Spinward
Marches. Originally stationed in Atsah/Deneb, prior to
the Abandonment. Long combat experience against Vargr
raiders, and dealing with the refugee crisis when the
Regency abandoned trailing Deneb gave the fleet
considerable experience in either non-traditional and
low intensity combat roles, experience it has put into
good use since moving to the Sword Worlds. Heavy
squadrons are of little use against guerillas, so most
of the Old Ironclads ships are less than 20,000 tons
displacement. It does retain three modern BatRons at
Sacnoth and Gram to deter conventional attacks by the
remaining independent Sword Worlds. While Sword
Worlders in naval service are not as uncommon a sight
as one might think, few Sword Worlders are permitted
to serve in this fleet, mostly to deter infiltration
and to protect Pro-Regency personnel from reprisals
for collaborating.
<P><B>
154th (Spectral Fire):</B> Usani/Deneb. The 154th Fleet
and its personnel has had a love-hate relationship
with
Deneb's religious government. The 154th incorporates
the "Burning Man" of Avernus into its official
insignia, imagery that the Willies claim to be
sacreligious and offensive. And the fleet has had
several run-ins with the Flower of the One, the
fundamentalist military arm of To Will One Thing, who
seems to be unnecessarily activist in helping defend
the Frontier, especially those worlds with active
missionary ministries. The 154th is second only to its
neighbor the 183rd in the number of battles and
engagements fought against Virus. This is quite a
change from its prewar role as a transport and
logistics support for the Marches, and it is now
considered to be an cherry posting.
<P><B>
173rd Communications (Heartbreakers):</B> Trojan
Reach/Reft communication fleet. Originally
headquartered at Trin/Trin's Shroud, it brought the
first notification of the destruction of that world to
the rest of the Regency.
<P><B>
183rd (Gatekeepers):</B> RQD 4. No other fleet has seen as
much action or combat than the 183rd.  With a wide
area of responsibility facing the main body of the
former Imperium and much of the Vargr Extents, the
fleet is subjected to frequent Vampire incursions. At
the peak of the Quarantine War, fleet units were
averaging two or three battles a week against against
ships ranging from errant small craft to infected
former Imperial Dreadnoughts.  Now battles may occur
once or twice a year for most line units, but the
fleet remains a cherry posting for ambitious and
aggressive naval personnel. Demand for Frontier duty
is high enough normally, but the 183rd's G-4 office
only has enough billets for about 1 out of every 10
applications it receives, and its selectivity
makes the fleet one of the most skilled and elite in
the Regency.
<P><B>
184th (Denebian Highlanders):</B> Plankwell/Spinward
Marches. The Highlanders were once the smallest of the
Domain of Deneb's fleets. Assigned to nearly empty
Kamlar and Vast Havens subsectors in Deneb, it was
mostly a punishment posting for recalcitrant naval
personnel. The Abandonment caused major changes for a
fleet accustomed to boring patrols to check and
maintain calibration points. The Highlanders were
moved to the newly expanded Regency territory in what
was still District 268, and was posted against pirates
and renegade Aslan raiders. Plankwell is rather boring
compared to other Regency interface regions, but it is
a step up, and is used as a rest and recuperation
posting to reward decorated or distinguished
personnel.
<P><B>
193rd (Unbreakable Will):</B> Vilis/Spinward Marches. The
fleets name (and Emporer's Unit Citation in its
insignia) reflects its brave defense of Efate/Regina
during the Fifth Frontier War. Despite being cut off
from main Imperial supply lines to rim and trailing,
the 193rd did not budge, and successfully held up
Zhodani supplies and reinforcements earmarked for
their fateful thrust into Rhylanor. Outsiders say that
this success has gone to their heads, convincing them
of their invincibility in battle. Members of the 193rd
like to say that they simply lack any kind of fatalism
in the face of conflict. New recruits and transferees
are subjected to a three month "probation" period
where they are apprenticed to a higher ranking or more
experienced veteran, who proceeds to indoctrinate the
tenderfoot in the tenacious tactics favored by this
fleet. Vilis Subsector is hardly a garden spot, and
low tech levels and poverty breed smuggling
operations, and the 193rd's patient, determined
demeanor makes them a bane to local "Kangaroos".
<P><B>
194th (Iron Guard):</B> Pretoria/Deneb. The 194th is less
of a battle unit than an internal peacekeeper.
Pretoria has a long history of political friction,
most famously the Rachelean Revolts. Previous to the
Civil War, fleet units were in control of the
subsector capitol itself in the Revolts wake, and were
instrumental in calming and reconciling the Vilani
majority of the subsector with Solomani or Mixed race
immigrants. This experience was highly useful in the
face of large Vargr refugee flows that flooded the
subsector in the period of 1136-1148.  While the Vargr
have proven more difficult to deal with than the
Vilani, the 194th's large number of Civil Affairs
units and long experience in low intensity policing
have kept open warfare from breaking out between
struggling factions and Pack Dens.
<P><B>
195th (Stronghearts):</B> Sabine/Deneb. The Sabine
Subsector fleet saw extensive action against the
Zhodani during the Fifth Frontier War, helping to
shield Rhylanor and Mora from Zhodani raiders and deep
penetration units. It also fought at the Battle of
Rhylanor, and became famed for its resolve despite
heavy resistance. The worlds of Sabine are more
fractious than most, and its units spent a great deal
of effort to preserve internal peace during the
antebellum period. Like nearby Rhylanor, the worlds of
Sabine have faced several Viral near misses, and the
Stronghearts have become very adept at ferreting out
the intent of unidentified merchant ships and
enforcing Quarantine requirements.
<P><B>
196th (Keystone):</B> Star Lane/Deneb. The 196th had
mostly been a training and logistics fleet before the
Collapse. Assigned to the backwater Star Lane
subsector, the fleet was considered to be too far away
from any potential trouble spots to be of much
effectiveness. Its line units did engage the Zhodani
in the last Frontier War, but it never rose above a
second tier supply rating in the entire antebellum
period. The fleet retains its lower rating, but it now
must actively work as a facilitator of fleet movements
fromthe Marches to Deneb, and vice versa. Most of its
bases are located in the rimward portion of Star Lane,
where it backs up the Rift fleets.
<P><B>
201st (Blood and Silver):</B> Pax Rulin/Trojan Reach.
Originally the 144th Fleet, the first full Imperial
naval unit to be stationed in the Reach. In the first
couple of centuries of settlement, the Reach was a
bastion of pirates that preyed on shipping out of the
Glisten belt. Most of these pirates were keen on
raiding precious metals and radioactives, and bloody
battles erupted along the rimward border between light
naval units and the raiders. The 144th Fleet occupied
Gazulin Subsector, and destroyed pirate strongholds in
both Tobia and Pax Rulin. It was redesignated the
201st in 1058, after the Reach was declared a
self-governing sector. It saw considerable action
against Zhodani raiders and scouts in the Fourth and
Fifth Frontier Wars, and the disaster at Ganulf (TR
1307) occured on its watch. Today the fleet is mostly
concerned with maintaining the tense peace between the
local Imperial culture humans and more recently
immigrated Aslan.
<P><B>
202nd (Rock Sirens):</B> Gazulin/Trojan Reach. The 202nd,
under the guidance of Duke Sharik Arcadia, spent the
Civil War period playing off the invading Aslan clans
against one another. This was accomplished by the
fleet's intelligence sections, which used bribery and
alliances of convenience to divide the conquering
ihatei and eventually halting their advance. The fleet
did suffer heavy losses in its defense of Gazulin and
Neumann, and Anti-Aslan sympathies are still nursed by
some of the rank-and-file. The Sirens get first pick
of new ships coming off of the production lines at
Neumann, making it the best equipped fleet in the
Reach.
<P><B>
203rd (Lightkeepers):</B> Sindal/Trojan Reach. The 203rd
originally just defended Albe itself, and reinforced
the Imperial border against raids by either the
Zhodani and other human pirates. The fleet hunkered
down in the face of the Ihatei, earning the respect of
their enemies for their unflinching bravery. Unlike
other Regency fleets, the Lightkeepers project a more
reasonable attitude towards the Aslan, but back up
their shining demeanor with a lot of heavy firepower.
Because Albe is the main trade interface with the
Aslan, the fleet is primarily concerned with commerce
protection, peacekeeping, quarantine enforcement and
maintenance of the subsectors static defenses.
<P><B>
204th (Heaven and Earth):</B> Tobia/Trojan Reach. Heaven
and Earth was understrength at the beginning of the
Imperial Civil War, a fact exaceberated by Sector Duke
Quinn's decision to dispatch several of its squadrons
to reinforce the Domain's trailing borders. Faced with
light resistance, Ihatei crashed the border in 1119,
and quickly overran its bases. But instead of
surrendering to the victorious Aslan, units cut off
from the Domain went underground as guerillas,
maintaining a tenuous supply line with Gazulin. Heavy
units of the fleet were released from service against
the Vargr, and supported their comrades from bases in
Vestus subsector. These guerillas stocked arms caches
and reconoitered Aslan defenses so effectively, that
when the Regency reclaimed the region in 1131, it was
able to focus its attacks against clan C3I facilities
and other strategic defenses with pinpoint accuracy.
Heaven and Earth still maintains lighter guerilla and
raiding units alongside its more conventional forces,
and it operates in both environments with equal
aplomb.
<P><B>
207th (Ronin):</B> Trin's Shroud/Spinward Marches. The
Trin's Shroud subsector fleet have never forgotten,
and have never forgiven.... themselves that is. The
personnel of the 207th wear their disgrace openly,
taking on an air of self-castigation for their failure
to protect Trin from the depredations of the Kishkii.
Today the Ronin preside over a subsector still reeling
from the effects of 1139. Trin is centuries away from
recovery, and the subsector economy and population are
still well below that before the Rape. To their credit
its officers and and rank and file do not pine for the
unrecoverable past, but they are not necessarily
pleased with the present or the forseeable future. The
fleet is vehemently vengeful about its losses, and its
past commanders have aggressively sought out
operations on the front against Virus. But privately
the personnel of the 207th believe that nothing more
than the complete extermination of Virus would expunge
their dishonor. Needless to say the unit is a hotbed
of Exterminationist fervor, and many Flame of Purity
terrorists have emerged from its ranks.
<P><B>
208th (Vanguard):</B> Five Sisters/Spinward Marches. The
Vanguard has defended Five Sisters for close to 250
years. The fleet has always been structured to operate
with a minimum of outside support, though that means
it lacks many of the amenities and ample resources
available to other Regency fleets. Its squadrons rely
upon a more varied mix of ships, and they lack heavy
tanker and transport support. To compensate, the fleet
has relied heavily upon proactive defensive patrols
outside of the Sisters, and eschews linear set-peice
battles in favor of quick lightning strikes against
enemy bases and rear echelons. The fleet has seen
heavy action against the Zhodani in the last three
Frontier Wars, a record that few other Regency fleets
can match.<P><B>

210th Research (Ancient Treasures):</B> Regency R&D fleet
headquartered at Daryen in the Darrian Confederacy for
the development of TL-16 ships. It also maintains a
joint training facility at Nosea/Darrian with the DCN.
<P><B>
212th (Hellhounds):</B> Jewell/Spinward Marches. The 212th
is most famous for its routing of Vargr fleets that
had invaded Regina subsector during the Fifth Frontier
War. The Hellhounds have resided in Jewell since the
end of the war, and the subsequent detente and later
alliance with the Zhodani Consulate did not go down
well with hardliners in its ranks and officer corps.
The spinward frontier was quiet until recently, and
Anti-Zho sentiments had nearly died out, replaced with
a simpleminded complacency and acceptance of the
status quo. The Exodus is an unprecedented challenge,
since enough long memories still exist on both sides
of the border to reignite hostilities should any
provocation occur.
<P><B>
213th (Swordbreakers):</B> Regina/Spinward Marches. The
fleets name comes from its decapitation of the Sacnoth
Fleet during the Fifth Frontier War. It has come to
affect much of the same stuffiness as the rest of
Regina simply by association with the First Regent's
birthplace, though the 213th was only a marginal
participant in the creation of Norris' legend. Like
their neighbors in the 212th, Anti-Zho sentiments have
been cool until recently; much more anipathic energy
is spent upon Vargr corsairs and smugglers that try to
evade the Quarantine along the rimward border.
Constant practice against these foes has sharpened the
skills of its marines and Hammerhead boarding unit
into being probably the best in recorded history.
<P><B>
214th (Earth Serpent):</B> Aramis/Spinward Marches. The
Aramis fleet name and insignia invoke the Midgard
Serpent of Solomani myth. The Sword World naval
commander in chief during the Fifth Frontier War had
grandiloquently proclaimed his forces as being as
unstoppable as the legendary serpent, claiming they
would "eat" the defending Imperial forces in Lunion as
one would a crumb. The 214th would later retrieve his
personal banner from his shattered headquarters as
their sole war booty, and carry it proudly into
battle. The fleet was left understrength after the
war, and had difficulty protecting Aramis from
invading Kforuzeng corsairs during the Imperial Civil
War. The 214th has the largest percentage of Vargr
officers and enlisted men....er dogs of any unit in
the Regency Fleet. Its mission is virtually similiar
to the Lightkeepers, though combat with the Pack and
its affiliated corsairs is a frequent occurence.
<P><B>
222nd (Flame Forged):</B> Deneb Training. The 222nd is
headquarted from the "virtual" navy base at
Dekha/Vincennes. Like its counterparts it has units
scattered around Deneb sector, but its mission is
tasked more towards direct military operations against
Virus and Vampires.
<P><B>
257th Fleet (Elohim):</B> Inar/Deneb. This subsector fleet
is a heavyweight unit. Besides being tasked to defend
Deneb Depot Alpha, it is the primary backstop for
Lamas, Antra and Namidshur fleets, owing to the lack
of
adequate basing facilities and the presence of large
Vampire threats. Depot Alpha's extensive facilities
make up for this, and boosts the fleets units with new
build warships and supply/support ships. Because of
lingering Imperial nostalgia on Depot Alpha, it is the
most contaminated with reactionary political
sentiments. Elohim units are carefully watched lest
they attempt another Blacklight Plot.
<P><B>
258th Fleet (Seraphim):</B> Vincennes/Deneb. This is the
best equipped fleet after the 73rd. Its proximity to
TL-16 manufacturing facilities on Vincennes and Dekha
gives first choice for new advanced ships and
equipment. It has also seen considerable action on the
Deneb Front. Unfortunately its prestige and
effectiveness has been blunted by continuing
controversy between Dekha and Vincennes over the
construction of new naval bases among the high
population worlds of the subsector. The Regency
proposed to build one such facility in 1142, but
squabbles over who would obtain the facility has kept
it from being built. Current facilities in the
subsector are insufficient and overloaded, and the
Seraphim and its people are frustrated at the paradox
of possessing the latest technology, and the worst of
housing and base facilities.
<P><B>
260th Fleet (Trailblazers):</B> Zeng/Deneb. The Zeng
Subsector fleet has been heavily engaged against
Vampires for the last seventy years. The Trailblazers
defend a section of strategic naval bases that anchor
the trailing to coreward kink along the periphery of
the Rift. Vampires have attempted to overrun these
bases on several occasions, and the battles for Ibsen,
Balzac and Jecife have been bloody fleet brawls. But
where it has triumped against silicon enemies from
beyond, it has had a much harder time securing the
peace against the domestic squabbles that have rent
Zeng in the last quarter century. The fleet has a very
large TL-16 arsenal, courtesy of the efforts of Depot
Beta and Lilad, but the current troubles on the latter
worldhas analysts worried about the supply of crucial
components to the fleet.
<P><B>
303rd Fleet (Valkyries):</B> Gulf/Deneb. This fleet is
primarily tasked as a reserve force in case of a major
incursion by an enemy into the Regency. This function
is due to the large number of vessels made available
to the fleet by the Spinward Defense Complex. In the
antebellum period the Valkyries were more concerned
with weapon testing and training. After the Battle of
Furens, it underwent a major reorganisation. In
conjunction with the 2nd Experimental Fleet, it trains
constantly against simulated Vampire Fleets, and its
methods are so good that it is an advanced training
school for recently graduated line officers. The
Valkyries often deploy to the Frontier for shakedown
cruises, and its units have seen considerable action.
<P><B>
315th Fleet (First to Fight):</B> Lamas/Deneb.
Headquartered at Lamas/Lamas. Previously known as the
1st Fleet during the Fifth Frontier War, before
postwar reorganisation cost it its designation, though
it lives on in the fleets nickname. Though in theory
the 315th defends the small sliver of Lamas that is
included in the Safe, in practice its units are
frequently rotated out to the Frontier for exercises
or missions in support of the 61st. Occasionally some
of its units have been assigned to the 183rd, and many
of its squadrons have Wildside combat experience. It
has an unhealthy hatred of Vargr criminal and corsair
elements, and its units have been unnecessarily harsh
in their prosecution of these groups.
<P><B>
319th Communication (Herald Angels):</B> Capitol
communication fleet at Mora/Mora. The 319th is tasked
with keeping the Regent and the national government
informed of all events of note within the borders of
the Regency. The 319th also runs fleet communications
through the Hub and the spinward Stronghold.
<P><B>
336th Communication (Bat Out of Hell):</B> Deneb
communication fleet, headquartered at Deneb/Usani. The
336th was formed after the Rape of Trin, and is in
charge of all communication ships on the Frontier and
subsectors directly adjacent.
