<B>CIN/Aurora, 1/X/1202</B>: reported <FONT SIZE=2>by <A HREF="mailto:fcain@st6000.sct.edu">Franklin Cain</A></FONT><P
><p>

An official spokesman from the Public Affairs Office of the RC Navy issued
a press statement today announcing the establishment of four deep-space
refueling stations within the RC borders.  This doesn't come as much of a
surprise, as the existence of these four d/s stations has been one of the
worst-kept secrets in the history of the RC.  The four stations are
located at 0833/Aubaine, 0938/Oriflamme, 1034/Oriflamme, and
1137/Oriflamme.  These stations are being supported by two squadrons of
Oasis-class tankers (modified relic Xboat tenders).  Sahara squadron is
based out of Baldur and services the stations at 0833 and 1034.  Gobi
squadron is based out of Shenandoah and services the stations at 0938 and
1137.  <p>

These stations are open to the general starfaring public (in fact, these
stations were supposedly established "to promote interstellar commerce
within the RC"), but be advised that the stations themselves and the
surrounding "airspace" within a radius of 300,000 kilometers are under
martial law due to the hazardous environment.  Be sure to follow *all*
established protocols for these situations.  <p>

Also included in this press release was an announcement that the RCN is
accepting bids from civilian enterprises to assume responsibility for
maintaining these stations.  <p>

McKenzie Holdings, a salvage company registered out of Aubaine, has
formally established a legal claim to <A HREF="../opal/opal1030.html">Adrian</A> (0432/Aubaine; new UWP is
D426112-9).  The new starport is class D, and was expanded from a former
class G spaceport.  The new starport has a few repair bays capable of
handling small ships (200 tons or less).  Refined fuel is available at the
starport, as well as lodging and food.  Currently, about 30 sentients 
permanently live at McKenzie Station.  <p>

McKenzie Holdings has provided RCES with a small facility for use as a
scout base, at no cost to RCES.  They have also formally petitioned for
status as a client-state of the RC.<p>  

McKenzie Holdings makes most of its money at Adrian by salvaging the relic
TL-14 equipment.  They also make some money servicing the ships going
between Fija and Eos and Nike Nimbus (as the shortest route from Fija to
either of these worlds is by way of Adrian). <p>

><p>

A cometary body has been found in deep-space at astrographical coordinate
0636/Aubaine, and a fueling station will be established there by Singh,
Singh, and Co., a recently formed corporation registered here in Phoebus.
The comet was discovered by James (Jimmy) Singh, a belter originally from
Aurora.<p>  

The rights to this comet were supposedly leased to the RC Navy at Aurora 
just a few weeks ago for an undislosed sum of money, but apparently there
was a loophole written into the contract by his sister, Lilith (Lily)
Singh.  The contract forbid Mr. Singh from reselling these rights "to any
party not mentioned in this contract."  As Ms. Singh was listed in the
contract as her brother's agent, he was legally able to sell mining rights
to her even after leasing these rights to the RCN.  <p>


The fueling station being built by Singh, Singh, and Co. will supposedly
be open to the general starfaring public and will have refined fuel
available for the standard price.  <p>

There has been no offical comment by the Public Affairs Office of the RCN
on this matter.  An anonymous source is quoted as saying "I'm angrier at 
the [bureaucrat] who signed the contract than I am at [Ms. Singh].
[Laywers] can't help they way they are.  It's genetic or something, like
being a microbe."<p>

An official spokesman from the Public Affairs Office of the RC Navy issued
a press statement today announcing that unlicensed, unregulated mining by
the general starfaring public will be permitted at the deep-soace
cometary body located at astrographical coordinate 0636/Aubaine.  Thus,
the crew of a ship jumping to this coordinate in deep-space will be able
to refuel their ship at no cost (other than time).  This is obviously in
response to the action initiated by Singh, Singh, and Co. reported by
CIN/Phoebus on 4/VII/1202.  <p>

 RCSA is pleased to announce that Captain (Ret.) Miller Philibus has been
selected to head the newest addition to the RCSA:  BARD - Bureau of
Aggregate Reference Data.  Director Philibus is well known for his services
performed in the RCN before his accident in the wilds that left him without
the use of his legs.<P>



 In a press conference this morning, Director Philibus expressed his
enthusiasm about the future of the BARD project.  "After seventy years of
sitting dirtside, we have once again been given the stars, but even the best
minds forget things in seventy years.  This is where BARD comes in!!"
According to Director Philibus the BARD files will be a collecting place for
information that will help Coalition citizens learn more about this universe
that we live in.  The data will include everything from abstracts on jump
drive systems to tourism info on the member worlds.  <P>

<P>
Dulinor the Black, accompanied by his entourage, ascended the stage of
the Yankermon Sportsplex to the cheers of a massed audience of over
fifteen thousand screaming supporters.  Sporting his customary tousled
hairstyle, and clad in his ceremonial toga, Strephon's assassin haild
the crowd as strains of "<I>The Clarion</I>," the Ilelish Federation
anthem, thundered throughout the darkened arena.  As he coolly surveyed
the massed thousands below, the would-be Emperor has but one question to
pose to his loyal followers arrayed below: "YANKERMON, ARE YOU READY TO
RAVE?!"<p>
No, it's not a nightmare returned from a dark and discredited era, it's
Fija's newest pop sensation: Dulinor the Black and the Stormtroopers of
Ilelish.  Known mainly for it's frontman, Dulinor the Black (the former
Ned Whiskus, who bears and uncanny resemblance to the former Imperial
leader), the band claims preeminence as the leader of a new Fijan
musical movement known as "Rave."<p>
Rave, which centers on the unusual, the iconoclastic, and the
outrageous, appears to have taken over Fijan youth culture almost
overnight.  "It's as if something was just waiting about in and
embryonic stage," declared Dr.  D.D. Demented, a prominent music critic
and commentator of the Fijan cultural scene, "Poof!  Just add water, and
there it was."<p>
If the ultimate aim of Rave is to shock, then last night's performance
certainly acheived it.  The set, which lasted approximately 90 minutes
alternated between blasts of cacophonic music punctuated by chants from
Dulinor of "Crash Lucan!" and "I did it for the Good of all Humanity!,"
and an elaborate tableau acted out by Dulinor and his bandmates.  Giant
screens placed strategically about the auditorium broadcast cleverly
edited speeches by the real Dulinor, which often drowned out the ranting
coming from the stage.  Sound limits sampled from inside the building
exceeded safety limits for human hearing at least twice, prompting Enos
Weatherby, leader of the Parents' League for Fijan Decency to denounce
the event as a, "dastardly sonic attack on our vulnerable youth!"<BR>
One concert-goer, interviewed after the event, summed up the music in
this way; "It's a bit bland, but its got a good beat, and you can dance
to it."

<P>
STRATEGIC BULLETIN TO ALL RCES PERSONNEL<BR>
Be advised that RC Space Forces have encountered elements of a
potentially hostile starfaring organization referring to itself as the
"Mercantile Guild."  Current disposition, doctrine, and bases remain
unknown, but "the Guild" appears to function as a loose confederation of
ship captians and crews engaged in various commercial and piratical
activities within a number of subsectors including the Primary Area of
Operations.<p>
Guild activity encompasses a wider range of both piratical and
legitimate commercial activities including, but not limited to:
interstellar trade, mercenary activity, relic salvage, slaving and
outright piracy.  In many instances, the activities constitute a direct
threat to RC interests and long term goals.  Guild involvement has been
detected on several worlds within the Primary AO, almost always in
opposition to RC activities; for example, in the instances of
suspiciously high-tech anti-armor weapons, such as the infamous "Crunch
Guns," found in the hands of various TEDs.  Additional, more disturbing,
evidence of Guild machinations has been uncovered, particularly in the
strategic-diplomatic arena.  Most notoriously, the Guild has been linked
to the recent outbreak of Folgorex disease on Ra.<p>
In the event of an encounter with Guild operations or individual
Guildsmen, be aware that the bulk of Guild activity falls within the
realm of legitimate commerce.  In many instances, Guild presence has
been countenanced by local planetary authorities.  RCES personnel are
authorized to act with discretion in the event of uncovering any
wrongdoing by Guild members, but are not authorized to interfere with
lawful trade unless specifically ordered to do so.  As a matter of
policy, all RCES personnel are requested to remit all details of Guild
encounters to RC Intelligence for analysis upon return to Coalition
Space.<p>
Further information on Guild activities, doctrine, and tactics will be
supplied to RCES personnel as it becomes available.  For a cursory
catalogue and description of typical Guild equipment and weaponry, refer

Guide.

<P>
Following a highly unusual and unorthodox personal meeting between
himself and Oriflamme's ruling Council of Technarch, Lt. General Rafael
"Blackheart" Cohen emerge to announce his immediate dismissal as
Commandant of Oriflamme's celebrated Corps of Marines.  The
announcement, which took local officials completely by surprise, comes
hard on the heels of growing criticism of Lt. Gen. Cohen's tenure by
elements of Oriflamme's centrist Right at home and in the Assembly.<BR>
Cohen, who appeared angry, but enormously controlled, at the time of the
announcement, denied that his dismissal had anything to do with RC
politics, and characterized the matter as "essentially, a question about
justice."  Sources close to Lt. Gen. Cohen report that he had been
enraged by the harsh sentences given out to several dozen ex-Oriflammen
Marines as purported "subversives," and came today to personally
petition the Council of Technarchs for their release.<p>
Cohen has had a long and distinguished career in Oriflamme's service,
and has held several important staff and field postings.  His chief
claim to fame was as a field commander during the initial Oriflammen
landing on Spencer, and his innovative approach to operatons there
undoubtedly saved countless Marine and civilian lives.  It is widely
thought by independent military observers that Cohen stands among the
front rank of Coalition military commanders, along with Commodore Sean
"Hammer" Lathrop  and Commander Pat "Who Me?" Ritter, although he has
never entered official RC service.<p>
Further interviews with Lt. Gen. Cohen were unobtainable, as it was
announced after his press conference that he would be leaving the
capital to vacation with his family at an undisclosed location somewhere
on Oriflamme.  Asked by a reporter as to whether this meant Cohen had
been placed under arrest or detention, a ranking member of the
Oriflammen Interior Ministry appeared startled, and hurriedly replied,
"Oh, God, of course not.  The General is quite free to go wherever he
wishes.  You just can't imagine how surprising this is to us."

<P>
Navel spokesmen today made the long-awaited announcement regarding the
location of the site of the proposed Reformation Coalition Navel Warfare
Training Center.  According to Cmdr. Jay Hays, currently head of Project
"Brilliant Lances," the installation will be located in the outer
reaches of the Kruyter system and will be operational sometime in the
beginning of 1203.<p>
"Brilliant Lances" will consist of an enormous maneuver and testing
range seeded with thousands of small sensor drones interlinked to the
installation's main computer, and will enable RC Space Forces to hold
enormous wargames and other operational simulations.  The station has
been termed "a first-class navel warfare school which will train
following generations of RCN and RCES crews in the vital combat skills
necessary in winning back the Wilds."  In addition to training RC Space
Forces, the installation will also be available to the navies of the
various member worlds, as well as visiting Hive Federation and RC
merchant ships.<p>
The announcement represents somewhat of a major coup for the RCN
leadership, as funding of the project has been held up in the Assembly
pending passage of the so-called "Ship Bill."  However, an impassioned
speech by senior Nimban delegate Ged Eflin favoring the funding of the
project tipped the Assembly to action, and the money was narrowly voted
through.<p>
In a related development, the price of Kruytercorp stock on the Auroran
Exchange soared following the announcement.  The company, which had been
struggling to maintain its mining activities within the Kruyter system,
is set to benefit from the inflow of capital in-system, and is well
positioned to take advantage of the lucrative military contracts soon to
ensue.

<P>
Citing "grossly incompatible cultural and political differences" between
its membership and Reformation Coalition society, Garvey Society
president Eugene Engili this afternoon announced that the organization
would begin raising funds to set up a colony beyond Coalition Space.<BR>
The settlement, which would consist solely of remnant Imperials and
their families, would be established somewhere "safely to rimward and
beyond the boundaries of the so-called Primary Area of Operations fo the
foreseeable future."  In addition to providing what Engili termed as a
"safe haven" for former Imperial and Solomani citizens, the colony would
be outfitted as a model settlement equipped to TL-14 or TL-15, and
provide "an alternative space for regeration of the Imperial ideal in an
atmosphere free from private contempt and public persecution."<p>
The Garvey Society, formed on Aubaine in 1197, consists mostly of former
Imperials dissatisfied with Reformation Coalition society and their
place within it.  Estimates of hardcore membership fall between 200-300
persons.  For all the Garvey Society's vociferousness, it remained weak
and impoverished until 1199, when the late Augustus Paedersen, a
reclusive and eccentric Aubani industrialist, left the group a sizable
behest in his will.  In late 1199, the headquarters of the society moved
to Shenandoah, where a community was established in a remote region of
the planet's North Continent to serve as what Society literature terms
as a "refuge."<p>
The Society was named in commemoration of Manwel Garvey, a remnant who
resided on Trybec; Garvey, a noted poet and literary critic from
pre-Collapse times, was stabbed to death outside his residence in 1196
by a gang of intoxicated youths in what police characterized as "a
hate-related attack based solely on Garvey's status as a former
Imperial."<p>
Local members of the Reformation Coalitions Remnants' Association, the
largest mainstream remnant organization, have denounced the initiativas "irresposible, regrettable, and unwise," and accused Engili and his
group of promoting "an atmosphere of apartheid."  Informed shortly
thereafter of this statement, Engili snapped, "Apartheid we have
already.  We Imperials remain second-class citizens in every respect. 
However, given a choice between apartheid and exile, we'll take exile."

<P>
Dulinor the Black and the Stormtroopers of Ilelish have canceled their
"Genocide" Tour following a close encounter with a trio of off-duty
Ithklur Marines at their debut concert last night in the Brusman's
Lampton Civic Arena.  Currently, both "Dulinor," and his bassist,
"Margaret Lucan," are hiding somewhere in Brusman following the ruckus
which resulted in severe damage to the auditorium, and necessitatied the
deployment of the Brusman Port Authority Police SWAT team.  Contact with
the press was made by their manager, Barney Lkath, who refused to meet
physically with reporters, and instead held the press conference via
hololink from an undesclosed location.<p>

The disturbance began approximately halfway through the band's opening
number, "Annihilation," when three enraged Ithklur leapt onto the stage
and attempted to seize Dulinor.  A free-for-all melee ensued between the
Ithklur and the rest of the band, which effectively ended the
performance and sparked off a riot as dozens of angry fans began
trashing the arena.  Dulinor and Margaret Lucan, who managed to slip off
the stage in the confusion soon found themselves hunted through the dark
warren of service tunnels beneath the stage by two of the Ithklur, while
the third grabbed a fire axe and began to methodically destroy the
band's equipment.<p>

The Ithklur pursuit of the controversial entertainers only ceased after
a liason with members of the Brusman SWAT team, assured them that
Dulinor would be apprehended and prosecuted posthaste.  Interviewed
shortly thereafter by reporters, the Ithklur explained that they had won
tickets to the concert through a local radio promotion, and had been
unaware as to the nature of the act before arriving at the arena.  They
also appeared puzzled as to why Coatlition society would tolerate an
individual whom they termed as "a vile war criminal" making a living as
a popular entertainer and media icon.<p>

At present, Hive Federation officials have been unavailable for comment.
