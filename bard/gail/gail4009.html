<H1>Psionic Anagathics</H1>

<H5>by <A HREF="../../credits.html#Stanley">Derek Stanley</A></H5>

<HR> 
 Psionic Anagathics is part of the Arcana subcluster and is the ability to halt, or ever reverse the effects
 of  natural aging.  Psionic Anagathics is a progressive out growth for the
 Self cascade and as such is unattainable without some kind of discipline
 in that field.  Unfortunately this power is not without it�s limitations
 or perils.<P>
 
 In order to attempt to use Psionic Anagathics the individual must first
 enter a Suspended Animation trance.  The Success Stage of the Suspended
 Animation trance directly effects the Success Stage attainable through
 the use of Psionic Anagathics.  Thus, an individual achieving a Stage 3,
 success would limit their Psionic Anagathics success to Stage 3.  All
 attempts at Suspended Animation are subject to the usual modifiers,
 although it is unlikely that most character will attempt to enter a
 Suspended Animation trance in the heat of battle, you never know.<P>
 
 Once the individual has entered Suspended Animation outside stimuli are
 no longer taken into account, unless the trance is broken, but we�ll
 deal
 with that later, as such the Psionic Base Difficulty Levels are base not
 on external stimuli, but rather on the individuals own Willpower and the
 length of trance they have entered, remembering of course that the
 length
 of trance attainable is directly effected by the Success Stage.<P>
 
 Curiously enough for every 5 people in the local area, 100 meters,  the
 Psion gets a +1 DM towards his or her Suspended Animation roll, their
 Suspended Animation Stages of Psionic Success roll, as well their
 Psionic
 Anagathic roll and finally their Psionic Anagathic, Success Stage roll.<P>

 During this time the Psion is carefully reviews the state of his or
 her body, and begins repairing damaged or defective cells and forcing
 controlled regeneration to replace dead or lost ones.  The mechanism
 that allows the Psion to preform this kind of controlled regeneration is
 unknown, it is assumed that the trance like state allows the Psion a
 much greater deal of control over the regeneration process than would
 normally be possible.  It is worthy of note that individuals in the area
 have reported a kind of unusual lethargy lasting for several day's, so
 it is assumed that the Psion taps into other peoples psychie's and uses
 them as a kind of energy conduit.<P>
 
 Here in lies the greatest hazard with Psionic Anagathics, an
 inexperienced individuals could potentially chose a defective or mutant
 cell to begin regenerating thus allowing this cells aberrant pattern to
 be spread to a greater percentage of the body.  The result of this
 modification while likely to be harmless at first, could, after repeated
 incorrect choices become so severe that the individual would simply
 awaken from his or her trance and find themselves no longer capable of
 surviving.<P>
 
 *Basic Success allows the Psion to halt the effects of aging for a six
 month period.
 *Stage Two success allows the Psion to halt the effects of aging for a
 single year.
 *Stage Three success allows the Psion to either a) Halt the effects of
 aging for a single year, or b) reverse the effects of aging six months.
 *Stage Four success allows the Psion to halt the effects of aging for
 two
 years or reverse the effects of aging by nine months.
 *Stage Five success allows the Psion to halt the effects of aging for an
 entire four year term or reverse the effects of aging by up to one year.
 *Stage Six success again allows the Psion to halt the effects of aging
 for an entire four year term or reverse the effects of aging by two
 years.
 *Stage Seven success allows the Psion to halt the effect of aging for an
 entire four year term or reverse the effects of aging but up to four
 years.<P>
 
<h3>Notes</h3>
 Being forcible awoken from a Psionic Anagathic state reduces the
 effectiveness of the Success Stage by the time the individual had
 remaining.  Thus, an individual entering into a Stage 3 four week trance
 is woken up after three weeks, may either halt the effects of aging for
 nine months or reverse the effects of aging by four months.  Waking up
 from a Psionic Anagathic state takes twice as long to recover from the
 effects as does recovering from a Suspended Animation trance, see pg.
 (234-235 TNE).<P>
 
 Psionic's may only attempt Psionic Anagathic's as many times in a years
 as they have PSI points.  Thus, a character with a PSI score of 5 could
 only attempt to place themselves into a Psionic Anagathic's trance 5
 times in one year.  For the sake of ease of calculations this should be
 a calander year rather than keeping track of the actual day's on which
 the attempts occured.<P>
 
 Individuals who fail a Psionic Anagathic skill attempt should suffer no
 penilty, it is assumed that they are unable to find any damage in need
 of
 repair and simply give up in frustration.  Individuals who critically
 fail their Psionic Anagathics attempt should keep track of the number
 of critical failures they have generated during the life of the
 character and consult the following table for Psionic Anagathic side
 effects.<P>

 <h3>Psionic Anagathic Side Effects dms</h3>
  <table border=0>
  <tr><TH>Critical Failures      <TH>         	DMS</tr>
  <TR><TD>1-5             <TD>             		+0</tr>

 (Plus one for every additional critical failure beyond 13.  i.e. 15
 critical failures have a DM of  +6.  Critical success cancel out the
 DM's associated with critical failures.  i.e.  A Psion with 9 critical
 failures makes a critical success on his next attempt, this critical
 success drops the Psion's number of critical failures of 8 thus reducing
 his number of DM's from 2 to 1.)

 <h3>Psionic Anagathic Side Effects</h3>
 Roll 2d6, add critical failures DM, subtract Psionic Anagathic's skill
 level.

 Finally the length of time a Psion can extend their life is in direct
 corralation to their level of psionic strength.  For every 1 point of
 PSI the GM rolls a d100 and adds that number to 100 minus the
 character's current age.  eg.  Sherri a Regency Psion is 24 years old
 and has a PSI of 7.  Her GM rolls 7d100 in secret and ends up with a
 total of 586.  By subtracting Sherri's current age, 24, from 100 the GM
 determines Sherri could live to a maximum age of 662.  While in game
 terms this number is rather esoteric, no one's going to be playing a
 character for 662 years, let along 100 years.  However, this is useful
 when creating long lived NPC's.  It allows the GM to get a rough
 estimate as to how old this individual might be.<P>
 
 Characters who have been using Psionic Anagatics to sustain their lives
 more than a couple of centuries are likely to become more than a little
 eccentric.  These individuals are likely to forget things in the past as
 their mental capacity begins to �fill up� and erase things that happened
 a long time ago.  How you deal with the mental effects of being immortal
 is up to you, but keep in mind the one thing immortals are all likely to
 possess is a great deal of patients, after all whats four or five
 months.
 Another point to keep in mind is that they are also likely to be rather
 distant, making friends when they�re just going to die isn�t something
 they�d take lightly, especially if it had happened a few times to
 particularly special individuals.<P>
