<UL><B>Spirian Citrons</B></UL>
   <UL>This is a Spiri Citrus Fruit and is like a deep red navel 
     lemon. </UL>
<UL><B>Beefsteak Tomatoes</B></UL>
   <UL>Another Spiri fruit. Superficially it looks like a tomato, 
     however, it actually tastes like a fine cut of meat, hence, 
     the name. These are often baked with garlic, onion, and 
     parmesan cheese for a traditional and filling meal.</UL>
<UL><B>Seedless Cranapples</B></UL>
   <UL>Yet another Spiri fruit. These are a common snack and
     appear like hard grapes. Varieties taste more or less like 
     the Ocean Spray drink. Varieties have different predominant 
     flavors (apple vs cranberry) depending on soil acid content.</UL>
<UL><B>Ruby Red Grapefruit</B></UL>
   <UL>Probably the produce Spiri take most pride in, this is the 
     only strain of produce brought from Earth which would thrive 
     on Spires.</UL>
<UL><B>Vezian Chiromoya</B></UL>
   <UL>Very similar to the fruit of Chile, however, this one is 
     sweeter and seedless.</UL>
<UL><B>Galosian Plantains</B></UL>
   <UL>Actually closer in taste to bananas, however, they are 
     quite large, often 1.5 meters in length.</UL>
<UL><B>Sunrise Melon</B></UL>
   <UL>"As sweet as the melons of Zloff" is a phrase still in the 
     vernacular, and with good cause. This most popular of Eosian 
     fruit has a light blue husk, going through pink, red, and 
     orange to the core of yellow. The seeds are also quite nice, 
     and taste like sunflower seeds, but have been genetically 
     engineered to be sterile to prevent this from growing 
     offworld.</UL>
<UL><B>Blood Orange</B></UL> 
   <UL>From Nike Nimbus, this deep red Orange is similar in taste 
     to the more typical variety of orange. It is a natural 
     aphrodisiac when cooked for about 4-5 hours at 400K.</UL>
<UL><B>Luhtalan Grapes</B></UL>
   <UL>While primarily renowned for their wine, this older variety 
     of grapes not used for wine is quite popular. The taste is 
     more similar to muscadines.</UL>
<UL><B>Dewmellon</B></UL>
   <UL>From Ra, specifically, the community of Sendegon. The
     Dewmellon is small (8 cm diameter), but quite tasty.</UL>
<UL><B>Melban Peaches</B></UL>
   <UL>Melban peaches come from the Isle of Melba on Aurora.  
     These sweet tangy fruits are a favortie Aurora.</UL>
