Current RC regulations limit the wearing and display of commodations and
medals to ceremonial dress; consequently, there are no service or
campaign ribbons.  This was a deliberate decision made to establish a
clear break with the Imperial tradition of dress, which delighted in
colorful ribbons and badges.<p>
