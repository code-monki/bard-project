<H1>Raising Attributes</H1>

PCs and NPCs can recover points lost from their attributes, as well as
improve their attributes, by using experience points (XPs) gained
specifically for this purpose.  By pursuing an appropriate exercise and/or
study program for the requisite number of hours during a four-week period,
the PC can acquire as many as three XPs.  These XP can be spent only to
improve the attribute(s) for which they were earned.  The PC chooses a
level of intensity (directly related to the total number of XP to be
earned), which then determines the minimum number of hours to be spent
on the exercise/study program during the upcoming four-week period, as
well as determing the base difficulty of the test of the PC's Willpower
skill.  Note that there is also a <B>maximum</B> number of hours that can be
spent on this program during any one week or day.  <P>

</table><P>

If the PC didn't perform an exercise/studt program during the previous
eight weeks, increase the difficulty of the test by one level.  If the PC 
consistently worked on an exercise/study program for the previous sixteen
weeks, decrease the difficulty of the test by one level (but not to below 
"Average" difficulty).  After determining the final difficulty level, roll
a separate check of Willpower for each XP to be earned.  A character can
try to earn more than one XP for the same attribute (e.g., a PC engaging
in a heavy exercise program can try to gain 3 XPs for her CON).  The PC
can change the level of intensity (by <B>one</B> level), as well as the
attribute for <B>one</B> of the XPs to be earned, at the beginning of a new
four-week period.  <p>

The number of XPs needed to raise an attribute by one point is equal to 
the current value of the attribute plus one, plus all the points of that 
attribute lost due to aging.  For example, a character with a current AGL
of 9 who had lost three points of AGL due to aging would need 13 XP to
permanently increase his AGL by one point (9 +1 +3 = 13).  Finally,
remember that characters <B>cannot</B> increase their attributes more than two
points above their pre-career values (i.e., after homeworld modifications,
but before career and/or aging effects).  <P>

(For my campaign, this <B>replaces</B> the Physical Development Program on 
page 32 of TNE.)  <P>



<h3>Addendum to the Aging Rules</h3>

When resolving aging tests during End-of-Term resolution, apply the
following DMs (based on the character's homeworld).  <P>

  <LI> If Homeworld TL is Pre-Ind, DM -4.  
  <LI> If Homeworld TL is Ind, DM -2.  
  <Li> If Homeworld TL is Pre-Stellar or Early Stellar, no DM.  
  <LI> If Homeworld TL is Average Stellar or High Stellar, DM +2.  
  <LI> If Homeworld TL = Extreme Stellar, DM +4.  <p>

Also, a character of a mostly-Vilani bloodline may have a DM of +1 to +4.
To determine the exact bonus, consult DGP's <cite>Vilani and Vargr</cite>.<P>
