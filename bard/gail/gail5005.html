	RCES spokesmen have announced plans for the construction of a new class 
of long-range exploration and trading vessels.  The starships, which are 
to be designated "schooners," would fall in the 1000 displacement ton range 
and would be equipped with a power spinal mount weapon, possess excellent jump and maneuver characteristics, and will enable RCES to undertake 
long distance missions beyond the current boundaries of the Primary Area 
of Operations.<P>
	The announcement has caused some controversy in the Assembly, with several
 centrist delegates already vowing to kill funding for the project.  RCES spokesmen have defended the project, claiming that RCES is already run
ning a number of strategic operations outside the AO with Assembly approval, and that the new ships are necessary for continued success.  In addit
ion RCES officials have pointed out that their service will require newer
 and more robust starships if they are to go ahead with the planned contact
 mission to the Covenant of Sufren, currently scheduled for sometime late next year.<P>
	If funded, the class will initially number six vessels; <I>Resolution</I>, 
<I>Spitfire</I>, <I>Hellion</I>, <I>Adventure</I>, <I>Daring</I> and <I>Endeavor</I>.<P>

	In a rare and unexpected show of unity, leading centerist and federalist
 Assembly delegates emerged from a marathon negotiating session this morning 
to announce that a rough agreement on the contents of the long awaited
 "Admission Bill."  Although the agreement remains provisional, both sides
 have expressed strong support for the compromise, reflecting that the 
agreement is, in the words of Oriflammen delegate Jerie Stakakis, "something 
we can all live with."  It is expected that a more formal draft of the
 bill will be submitted to the Assembly for ratification sometime later 
this month.<P>
	The purpose of the Admission Bill legislation is to enable the political
 expansion of the Coalition through the inclusion of new worlds.  Presently, 
the only new worlds added to the RC since its founding have been the 
boneyard world of Adrian and Vezina, conquered by RC military forces in 
1200.  Continued political squabbling between Assembly factions has prevented 
any meaningful addressal of the issue since, although a number of 
promising candidate planets have been contacted in the interim.<P>
	The compromise worked out last night side-steps the contentious issue of
 entry standards by the creation of what the document calls "Associate 
status."  Coalition Associates would enjoy certain privileges in exchange 
for a number of responsibilities within the scheme.  Associate worlds woul
d enjoy observer status at the RC Assembly, economic integration with the
 Coalition and enhanced educational opportunities, while retaining a large
 measure of their own local authority in exchange for a binding defensive
 agreement and Coalition-supervised governmental reform, as necessary.  
A two-year probationary would be mandatory, after which the issue of full
 membership would be subject to a free vote in the Assembly.

	Spiri officials are expressing consternation and dismay after a large 
starship filled with several hundred environmental activists landed on this
 pristine agricultural world to stage what Ecotopia Now! spokesmen termed
 a "Human Be-in."  Although there have been no reported incidents of 
violence, local people are upset at what appears to be a planned week-long 
event of therapeutic drumming, candle-light singsongs, crystal "convergences" and "masculinity/femininity" workshops.  A midnight march on the Evholt
 Forest, a local Spiri sacred site located some fifteen kilometers from 
the starport, was prevented only when Shrine Guardians announced that they 
were prepared to publicly commit suicide rather that allow the site to 
be "defiled."<P>
	Ecotopia Now! members profess to be mystified at the hostile reaction 
they have received from local inhabitants.  "Like, can't they see we're all,
 like, on the same side?" asked one reveler.  Another asked, "Can't we 
all just get along?"<P>
	Ecotopia Now! was founded in 1199 on Lucifer, ostensibly as an environmental
 watchdog agency.  Recently, the movement have begun to embrace elements
 of Pangaiaist philosophy and alternative spirituality, particularly 
after its Executive Council was co-opted by an Advisory Board mainly made 
up of Luhtalan entertainers and former celebrities.  The movement now numbers
 30,000, and draws membership from across the Coalition.

	Coalition recovery teams under the auspices of the Exploratory Service 
have extablished a permanent base of operations and frontier quality 
starport on the cemetery world of Bhule.<P>
	Though recovery operations have been underway on Bhule for quite sometime
 the pace of these operations has been painstakingly slow due to a near 
total infestation of embryonic viri.  To date these operations have yielded
 little in the way of strategic materials and were in danger of being 
canceled all together, however, thanks to the acquisition of new viral 
counter measures provided by the Covenant of Sufren the pace of these operations 
has recently increased to such a level that a permanently manned 
recovery station has become necessary.<P>
	All starship captains should modify Bhule's UWP to E510365-9 with a 
population code of 2 to reflect these changes.  Unrefined fuel is available 
to Coalition registered starships at standard rates.<P>
	On a more somber note, RCES teams working near the ruins of Bhule's 
Imperial Scout Base have discovered the nearly intact remains of the independent
 starship <I>Vigilante</I>.  A modified <I>Stellar</I>-class liner of the<I> Admiral Bertil</I>-class, 
the <I>Vigilante</I> was 
well known throughout the Diaspora sector for its actions against pirates and raiders 
during the Hard Times.  Perhaps best remembered for its actions in the Unity of 
Promise, the <I>Vigilante</I> 
dropped out of sight in Diaspora only a few short months before the final
 Collapse.

	What began over a month ago as a scheduled week long demonstration for 
peace and understanding on the pastoral world of Spires ended suddenly last
 night as the members of Ecotopia Now! hastily abandoned their cantonment, boarded off world transports and fled the system.<P>
	Though only a few of the Ecotopia members paused long enough let their 
thoughts be recorded the words they have left us with did little to dispel
 the mystery surrounding their sudden departure.  Many local Spiri described
 the Ecotopian's attitudes early last night as disturbed and obviously
 pre-occupied.  "They acted as if something in the shadows waited for them 
and they knew it.  They were all afraid, very very afraid."  One young 
Spiri woman reported.  "They professed a desire to achieve enlightenment 
and a oneness with nature, nature it seems, was not prepared to accept them." 
 Village elder M'kara Bhatal's words were considerably more cryptic.
  "The Evholt Forest is a source of great power, a power which they coveted 
but possessed neither the will nor the strength of character to possess.  
Much like your Pandora they merely desired to possess and not understand,
 that was their undoing.  Eventually the forest's spirit became their
 master and not the other way around, they could not accept that and so 
the forest turned on them."<P>
	One week ago four Ecotopia Now! members were arrested for skinny dipping
 in the sacred springs of B'shan near the forest's heart.  Though the 
Spiri steadfastly refused to accept any form of compensation from Ecotopia
 Now! for the incident, the perpetrators were immediately escorted to K'unara
 Downport and placed on the first transport off world.  One of these 
individuals was heard remarking before boarding the transport, "This is 
like, so unfair man.  We were just having some fun and now they're like, 
shipping us to Eos, postage paid.  We're like, Lhutalan's man, don't they un
derstand that?"<P>
	The field where the Ecotopia Now! camp had stood for more than a month
 is now devoid of activities, nothing more than a muddy field covered with 
collapsed tents and garbage.  Garbage that the Spiri have been left to clean up.<P>

	The pre-dawn skies over Janie lit up violently this morning as dozens of
 Soleean drop-ships descended from orbit and began securing the recently 
built starport in the Republic of Carcovaan.<P>
	Although initial resistance to the landings was fierce, the speed and 
ruthlessness with which the Soleean's attacked coupled with heavy orbital 
bombardment quickly subdued most of the Carcovaani resistance as many units
 were forced to fall back into more rural areas.  Though the extent of 
the orbital bombardment is unknown radio transmissions were intercepted 
from a number of key Carcovaani installations indicating that they had met 
a similar fate.<P>
	Three Mercantile Guild starships were either destroyed or captured on 
the ground and a handful of Guild technical advisors on
 loan to the Carcovaani government are known to have been captured during the initial landings.<P>

	In a move bound to create controversy, Secretary General Lon Maggart 
personally oversaw the appointment of Lt. General Rafael "Blackheart" Cohen 
as senior commander in charge of the Reformation Coalition Marine Corps.<P>

we cannot afford to have him sidelined because of problems here on Oriflamme. 
 As a military confrontation with the Empire of Solee becomes more 
and more inevitable men, of General Cohen's caliber are becoming increasingly
 valuable.  You may see this as a challenge to the authority of Oriflamme, I see it as the only alternative we have left."<P>
	Lt. General Cohen was relieved of his command by the Council of Technarchs
 last Sagittarius when he disagreed with the sentences handed out to a 
number of ex-Oriflammen Marines suspected of sabotage.  Since that time
 more than a dozen other Oriflamme Marines have been tried and convicted of
 acts of sabotage, a crime on Oriflamme which carries a minimum sentence
of 15 years hard labor, Lt. General Cohen has been present at each of 
these trials submitting evidence on behalf of the accused.<P>
	Several hours after the Secretary General's announcement Lt. General Cohen 
and his senior staff officers boarded the Reformation Priority Courier

	The mood around Devil's Throne was somber this afternoon as Junior Technarch 
of Public Affairs Hystr Prin announced the sudden and unexpected death
 of Senior Technarch Jessika Lucas and four of her senior staff members
 when their G-Carrier experienced a sudden power failure at an altitude of
 more than 5,000 meters and slammed into a mountainside just south of 
Bangala late last night.  Though officials on the scene are referring to the
 incident as an "unfortunate accident" they are quick to point out that 
Senior Technarch Lucas had been the recipient of a number of death threats
 in the weeks leading up to the crash and as such they are treating this
 as a criminal investigation rather than a civil one.<P>
	Though accidents of this type are not unheard of, the thirteenth Imperial
 Duke of Delphi died in a similar manner, they are uncommon enough that 
investigators are quick to rule out mere mechanical failure and instead 
have labeled the accident either a deliberate act of sabotage or mechanical
 incompetence.  "It's really to early to know exactly what happened to 
cause this power failure, but we're focusing our attention on the ventral 
power conduits.  There was a fair amount of internal structural damage 
inconsistent with the crash dynamics."  Said senior site investigator, Alain
 Crowder.  "Right now were waiting to hear back on the contents of the
 FDR's (Flight Data Recorders) recovered earlier this morning."<P>

	In a maneuver that can only be described as "audacious," advanced elements
 of Task-Group 17 engaged and defeated a pair of Soleean Patrol Cruisers
 in the Dunas system today.  The twin Patrol Cruisers were apparently 
engaged in a hard target search of the fourth moon of Gwendor, Dunas' largest
 gas-giant, when the encounter began.<P>
	"They were making enough noise to wake the dead."  Said Captain Ilkura "
Kegger"  Saturn of the RCS <I>Kelly Victrix</I>.  "We're still not sure what they
 were looking for, but they were so intent upon it that by the time they 
knew we were there it was already to late.  The <I>Angkor Wat</I> went low, we 
came in high, gave them the opportunity to surrender, they declined, so we
 lit them up with the missiles we had in place.  Poor bastards didn't even
 know what hit them."<P>
	An RCMC force eventually boarded the two stricken vessels and took the 
survivors prisoner.  While a large percentage of the Soleean crews were 
killed in the brief exchange of fire, the captain and first officer of one 
of the Patrol Cruisers were captured unharmed and immediately transferred
 to RC Navel Intelligence for interrogation.<P>
	As Navel Intelligence officers began scouring the vessels for information,
 a damage control team from <I>Angkor Wat</I> boarded the Patrol Cruiser, ISNV
 <I>Royal Defender</I>, to affect repairs in preparation for moving the vessel 
out of system.  The second Patrol Cruiser, ISNV <I>Imperial Guardian</I>, was
 considered unsalvageable and as such was abandoned in an eccentric orbit.<P>

	In a speech delivered early this morning Secretary General Lon Maggart 
spoke bluntly about the increasing tensions in Shenk subsector as a result
 of the Soleean Crisis and of a number of steps the RC would be implementing
 at home to ensure a swift resolution.  Though his words were vague 
about the actual dangers posed by Solee, the seriousness with which the
 Assembly views the situation was best exemplified with the SG's own words.<P>
	"With the continued deterioration of the Solee situation we are left with
 little choice but to commit a greater percentage of our forces to maintain
 that frontier, furthermore as the possibility of hostilities continue
 to increase with every moment it has been decided that there will be an
 immediate review of Oriflamme's, Bourgund Shipyards, and Trybec's, Dawn 
Construction Yards, B-ratings in the hopes that they can be upgraded to A-
classifications at sometime in the immediate future.  To this end no effort
 will be spared to assure the material and technical expertise are available
 to allow for this classification change to occure in a timely fashion.
  As such all materials recovered from the Wilds relating to the 
construction, repair and maintenance of starships and their components shall be
 considered eminent domain of these shipyards and shall only be distributed
 to other shipyards should those materials be superfluous."<P>
	For sometime technical crews from the Bourgund Shipyards and Dawn Construction 
Yards have traveled to Aubaine to acquire the necessary information 
and skills to allow for the eventual upgrading of these facilities.  In
 the wake of this mornings announcement by the SG it was decided during 
an emergency Assembly vote that technical experts from Aubaine would instead 
journey to the shipyards at Oriflamme and Trybec to oversee and assist
 with their transformation into A-class facilities.<P>
	It is expected that by sometime early tomorrow morning the first Aubani 
technical crew, consisting of some twenty-five individuals, will depart for
Oriflamme aboard the freshly returned <I>Fairfax</I>, additional crews will 
depart as necessary.  The first crews headed for Trybec are scheduled for

Dulinor the Black and the Stormtroopers of Ilelish announced in a press 
conference this afternoon that they would be "calling it quits till this whole 
Ithklur thing blows over."  The announcement came early this morning 
from a media filled penthouse suite high atop the Thessaloniki Hilton.<P>
	Originally formed under the name "Jump-Point-Zulu" the band had a number
 of minor hits on the Crystalline Label before changing its line-up and 
name more than two years ago.  Following the name change there was period 
of idleness during which the band engaged in an intensive hunt across Fija 
to find what front man Ned Whiskus, the man who became better known as 
Dulinor, termed "the one."  Four months later the band released their 
first album with new basist "Margaret Lucan" (formerly, Cadence L'engle of 
Thessaloniki).  Though slammed by the critics as "pedestrian" and "bland" 
the newly founded band would quickly climb the charts to become one of 
Fija's the most wildly popular bands, much to the dismay of trend analysts 
everywhere.<P>

 a glacially scoured rock outcropping known by locals at "Hestra's Table,
" Dulinor, Margaret Lucan and the other Stormtroopers of Ilelish delivered
 what critic's agree was perhaps their finest performance, lacking the 
stunning visual displays that had become their trademark it was an intimate

	<I>Coral Sea Victrix </I>along her sister ship <i>Cymbeline Victrix</I> and one other,
 as yet, unidentified RCS vessel were engaged in refueling operations 
around the smaller gas-giant Storvreta in the Dunas system late last night 
when a Soleean strike force jumped into system and attacked the three smaller
 vessels though the Soleean ships were eventually driven off it was not
 before inflicting heavy damage upon the Coalition vessels.<P>
	"From the start the engagement looked pretty much like a write-off.  They
 were bigger, faster and we were still cracking fuel.  It was our intention 
to simply jump out of system but their closure rate was to fast and <I>Coral
 Sea</I> had just completed her skim."  Said Captain J.L. "Jasper" Caledon 
of the <I>Cymbeline Victrix.</I>  Fighting a delaying action to allow for the 
recovery of survivors from the <I>Coral Sea Victrix</I>, Captain Caledon employed 
"unusual" tactics at best, closing with the Soleean command ship under 
cover of nuclear detonations until finally engaging the vessel with lasers 
and plasma cannons.<P>
	Though the <I>Cymbline Victrix</I>sustained heavy damage in the engagement the
 survivors of <I>Coral Sea Victrix</I> were recovered in a timely fashion allowing 
for the third RC vessel to join briefly in the fray before the Soleean's
 retreated.  Both surviving RC vessels are currently engaged in salvage
 operations of the <I>Coral Sea Victrix</I> in an attempt to deny Soleean high 
command of any useful intelligence.<P>
	Through analysis of the sensor logs on board the <I>Cymbline Victrix </I> the 
Soleean strike force has been identified as consisting of the following 
vessels: 1 <I>Kinunar</I>-class cruiser, 1 <I>Fiery</I>-class escort and 3 TL12 Far-Traders.
  Given the presence of the Far-Traders Coalition Navel Intelligence 
surmises that these vessels were bound for the Janie system with ammunitions 
and supplies for the Soleean forces occupying that world.<P>
