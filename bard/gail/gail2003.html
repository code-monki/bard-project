<P>
<B>Avalon:</B> Rumored Regency naval base complex located in
the Great Rift. Based upon analysis of shipping
patterns through trailing Deneb sector, experts think
that it is located near the boundary between Corridor
and Reft sectors.  But in many ways Avalon is more
reflective of the tensions and fears of Post-Collapse
society. Much like the legendary Area 51 of ancient
Terra, ROMs Freedonia 86 facility, and many Imperial
research stations, Avalon is a void into which the
popular imagination projects its hopes, dreams and
fears.
<P>
Most popular stories claim that, much like its
legendary antecedent, Avalon is a repository of a
massive force of Imperial era troops, possibly the
remnants of Strephon's loyal military units, being
kept in cold sleep until the Regency has a need for
them in the reclamation of the former Imperium. More
fanciful fiction has even gone so far as to proclaim
that Strephon himself sleeps alongside his Faithful,
and will lead them into battle himself to purge his
suffering empire of its demons, and restore liberty to
his people. The power of these "sleeping king" myths
in the popular mind should not be underestimated, as
it has been a rallying point for reformers and
revolutionaries for decades. The RQS and Regency
military have been guilty in the past of invoking the
story's mythic qualities for recruitment and
motivational purposes.  While popular credulity in the
story has died down in the last quarter century, it
remains a popular touchstone, symbolising the
slumbering potential of the Regency, now stirring to
awakeness.
<P>
<B>Diasporan Legate:</B> Regency's recolonisation "czar",
otherwise known as the Regency Frontier Office. The
RFO is considered to be a temporary affair until the
reestablishment of the Ministry of Colonisation. The
Legate is little more than an office with a minimal
staff so far, though a supporting bureaucracy is
slowly being cobbled together.  The Legate will
primarily be a judicial and legal enforcement body
overseeing disputes and infractions by colonists
moving into the former Imperial Wilds.
<P>
<B>Eternal Legion:</B> Regency's largest veterans group. The
Legion is a powerful lobbying and mutual aid group
founded in the early years of the 1130s to render aid
and give a political voice, to the increasing numbers
of military veterans created by the Imperial Civil War
and the Virus War. The Eternal Legion has "postings"
in most major Regency communities, and even a few
among those Vargr and Minor Spinward worlds that have
large contingents of troops stationed alongside
Regency forces preserving the Quarantine.
<P>
The Legion is both a base for networking and communal
gathering of military veterans, an advocacy group for
veteran affairs and government services, and a
political pressure group known for its conservative
principles. While not strongly supportive of Imperial-
era relics like the nobility or Imperial power
priveleges, it counts itself a strong partisan of the
restoration of the Iridium Throne, and at times seems
ambivalent about the merit of democratic reform. In
many ways the organisation has an excessive sense of
its own self-importance, a consequence of its naming
of First Regent Norris as the organisations first
"Commander" in 1144. While Norris declined the offer,
the nobility in which he did was percieved as poignant
self sacrifice by some within the organisation, and it
is often strident in its support and loyalty to the
Aledon-Alkhaliikoi family, and its eventual
restoration to the Throne on Capitol.
<P>
The Legion has been shameless in its perpetuation of
the Avalon myth, and takes its name and many of its
traditions from its inspiration. The membership body
of the Legion is known simply as the Fellowship, and
individual members are formally Loyal Friends of the
Flame, or just Friends.  It takes a stylised version
of the Arthurian Roundtable as seen from above,
covered with a circle of swords pointing towards the
center. A number of reactionary or radical movements
have founded refuge in some of its posts, namely the
Flame of Purity "liberation" movement of the Frontier.
<P>
<B>Interstellar Chamber of Commerce:</B>  Ancient business
organisation first founded on Terra before the
invention of jump drive. The ICC is a fellowship of
businesses and corporations, from the local to the
interstellar levels, that acts as a forum for business
related information and advocacy. The ICC was
refounded by a number of Denebian businessmen in 1125
to assist smaller planetary and subsector businesses
hurt by the withdrawal and contraction of the DoD's
economy in the wake of the Imperial Civil War.
<P>
While the Chamber is often criticised by many holdover
anti-corporate factions mindful of Imperial era
abuses, it is many ways a major improvement. For the
Chamber's primary mission since the Collapse has been
to foster the development of business in all sizes on
as many worlds as possible. In the face of Virus and
the war effort against it, the most efficient defense
is to deepen the level of commerce and provide a
necessary tax and logistical base both to fight and
survive it. And the attendant levelling of former
Imperial era Megacorps and new emerging smaller
businesses is a happy and welcome side effect.  The
Chamber often acts as a private mediator of business
disputes, quite an improvement over the trade wars of
the past.<P>

<B>Jump Conveyor:</B> A huge starship built to carry massive
loads. Conveyors are usually intended for colonisation
purposes, and usually displace more than a million
tons. They are almost always built without manuever
drives, to increase the amount of internal space and
cut down on unnecessary engineering crews. As such a
conveyor relies upon carried craft for refueling and
defense.  In naval parlance these huge immobil craft
are referred to as "mother pigs" or "beached whales".
Jump Conveyors are the primary vessels of choice for
the upcoming Askigaak Abandonment, and experience in
this operation is seen as a building block for
reexpansion into the former Imperium.
<P>
<B>Lynx's Crown:</B> Regency/Spinward States equivalent to
the ancient Nobel Prize.  The highest science award
presented in Charted Space.  The Crown is awarded by
the Society of Lynx's chapter on Starn after awarding
of the Starn Gold Medal is completed. The Crown is
awarded to only a single individual or groups of
individuals for an outstanding accomplishment in the
field of science.
<P>
<B>Medal of Conspicuous Gallantry:</B> The second highest
award for military bravery and valor. The MCG is
awarded for distinguished acts of battlefield valor,
though usually ones that do not incur as much risk or
danger as is incurred for the SEH.
<P>
<B>Meritorious Conduct Under Fire Citation:</B> Lowest award
for bravery awarded in the antebellum Imperial
military. Otherwise known as the "Good Attendance
Award" among Regency military personnel. The medal was
largely given out for political and morale reasons as
much as for genuine battlefield valor.  Since the
Collapse it has lapsed into obscurity.
<P>
<B>New Prometheans:</B> Popular name for the larger than life
personalities that dominated the Regency politically
and economically in the period 1140-1177.
<P>
<B>Point-to-Point Race:</B> Regency spanning regatta and
starship "race" that takes place every four years. The
race is a direct descendant of the antebellum Spinward
Point-to-Point that briefly flourished before the
Civil War. While its existence seems extravagant, the
race is often used by starship designers and
manufacturers as a proving ground for new technologies
and a showcase of Regency technical and military
power.  Each race has the same objectives:</B> contestants
must reach every designated checkpoint, where they
turn in an encoded "baton" to the local officials in
exchange for the baton confirming their arrival for
the next checkpoint. The contestant that passes
through each checkpoint and arrives at the finish
point wins.  All Point-to-Points start and finish at
the same system; since 1172 this has been
Neumann/Gazulin.  The last race, held in 1200, was won
by a research team from Guushigaar University on
Deneb, though it barely beat the Regency Navy Four
team and their ship by just twenty two minutes.
<P>
<B>Regency Jubilee:</B> The year of 1182 was the fiftieth
anniversary of the founding of the Regency. True to
Norris and the spirit he founded, it commemorated the
accomplishments of the nation as a whole, and not the
reign of him or his heirs. Despite the continuing
state of military readiness, nearly every world in the
Regency was able to spare some expense at celebrating
five decades of continued survival. The six months
leading up to the massive Jubilee celebrations on Mora
were marked by smaller ones on subsector capitals and
prominent high population worlds.
<P>
In many ways the Jubilee was a turning point in the
mentality of most Regency citizens. The fact that they
had survived fifty years in spite of the Viral threat
created a brief period of introspection, and then a
growing reaction against both Imperial era
institutions and the current Regency security state.
The period following the Jubilee was one of stirring
passions and enterprise, as entrepenuers and reformers
rode a surge of popular anger and disillusionment into
a series of political and economic revolutions more
decisive in impact than the abortive period following
the initial announcement of the Representational
Reforms.  The 1180s are seen as a decadent period in
Regency history, and one of confusion over the precise
course of the future. But it was also a time when the
customary attitudes and institutions of the
Post-Collapse period began to lose their potency, and
had to defend themselves against a rising tide of
dissent.<P>

<B>Regency Orders of Knighthood:</B> The First Regent
retained the archducal precedent of making knights
unmodified into the Post-Collapse era, and this habit
was not ended by the Representational Awards. The
First Regent consolidated the various orders, and
created several combined orders to expand upon his
conception of public service. The old racial and
special orders were abolished, though Regency Aslan
and Vargr have rarely complained about their
representation in the new fellowships. The Regency's
orders of knighthood are:</B>
<P>
<LI>1. <B>Order of Sword and Starship:</B>  Awarded to
distinguished military and quarantine personnel. Based
in part on the old Order of Starship and Crown.
Abbreviation: OSS
<P>

<LI>2. <B>Order of High Tower:</B> Conferred upon distinguished
business, cultural and political leaders. The emphasis
is upon public contribution, not economic success or
monetary wealth. Therefore a nun from a poor section
of Adabicci, who has tirelessly raised public
conciousness about Vargr orphans is more likely to be
inducted than your average corporate executive.
Abbreviation: OHT
<P>
<LI>3. <B>Order of the Sacred Flame:</B> The highest honor that
can be conferred upon a citizen of the Regency. Only
the most influential and distinguished members of the
Regency, whether military or civilian, ever recieve
the status of a "Flame Knight", and doing so is a
recognition of lifetime achievement.  Unlike other
orders, knighthood is conferred through a council of
all Regents, and is bestowed in the form of a medal,
the Sacred Flame Medallion. Abbreviation: OSF
<P>
<LI>4. <B>Honorable Order of the Arrow:</B> In antebellum times
the Arrow was conferred upon Imperial space explorers;
Norris wisely increased its scope to include anyone
who advances the frontiers of knowledge, whether
explorers, inventors or scientists. Winners of the
Lynx's Crown are almost always inducted into the order
within a few years of their reception of that award.
Abbreviation: HOA
<P>
<B>Regents Day:</B> Remembrance and celebration holiday
celebrated on the 81st day of the year, Imperial
calendar. The exact timing of this holiday is somewhat
controversial, as it seems to coincide more with
ancient Solomani tradition than with any particular
anniversary within Regency history. The holiday had
been championed by King Jupiter founder Huang Mu-Xing,
and the 81st day of the year coincides with ancient
Chinese concepts about the significance of the king.
Nevertheless the holiday is a popular one, and its
tone, pokmp and celebrance recalls traditional
independence day celebrations.
<P>
<B>Rotary Interstellar:</B> Interstellar organisation modeled
upon an ancient Solomani organisation. The Rotary
Interstellar is a humanitarian society founded upon
the ideal of public service for the betterment of the
society. The service organises chapters on individual
worlds, and where local conditions permit, in
individual communities on those worlds. RI has
chapters across the Regency, in many parts of the
Spinward Hinters, and even a few brave clubs in the
Zhodani Consulate and Vargr Splinters.
<P>
Unlike many groups espousing similar goals, Rotary is
more of a networking of different interests than a
cohesive bureaucratic organisation in its own right.
It recruits heavily among normal citizens, business
executives, and draws strong interest from corporate
and institutional parties across the Spinward States.
Its goals are general, and attuned to the community or
world level. It has four general goals:</B>
<P>
<B>FIRST:</B> The development of acquaintance as an
opportunity for service;
<P>
<B>SECOND:</B> High ethical standards in business and
professions, the recognition of the worthiness of
all useful occupations, the acceptance of all
sentients in all occupations as contributors to the
common good, and the dignifying of each Rotarian's
occupation as an opportunity to serve society;
<P>
<B>THIRD:</B> The application of the ideal of service in each
Rotarian's personal, business, and community life;
<P>
<B>FOURTH:</B> The advancement of interstellar understanding,
goodwill, and peace through a interstellar fellowship
of business and professional persons united in the
ideal of service.
<P>
(The previous four sections are adapted from material
on Rotary's main webpage:</B> www.rotary.org)
<P>
The Rotary has a number of ongoing projects. Most
notable are the current relief operations within
Zhodani refugee camps, an effort that has won praise
from all corners of the Regency for its organisation,
effectiveness and unjudgemental approach. It has been
a strong advocate of the psionic reforms, and has
fostered psionic education through the overt funding
of new Psionic Institutes across the Regency.
<P>
<B>Starburst of Extreme Heroism:</B> Highest medal rewarded
for bravery in combat to be awarded in the Third
Imperium and the Regency. The SEH is only awarded to
individuals who show extraordinary accomplishment on
the battlefield in spite of heavy risk to life and
limb, heavy resistance, or injury or possibility of
death. Needless to say, the SEH is usually awarded
posthumously.
<P>
<B>Starn Gold Medal:</B> Modern day equivalent to the ancient
Nobel Prize. The Gold Medal is presented by the Starn
Branch of the Society of Lynxs to worthy individuals
or research fellowships in several categories:</B>
physics, astronomy, chemistry, biology, medicine,
history and philosophy, economics, mathematics and
information theory.
<P>
<B>Swords and Diamonds:</B> Two additions to existing Regency
awards for gallantry, indicating multiple awards of
the same medal or citation. The Swords indicates that
an award had been bestowed twice, and Diamonds
indicate three times. Swords and Diamonds are usually
found for lesser medals of gallantry; A SEH with
Swords is extremely rare, and one with Diamonds is
unheard of.
