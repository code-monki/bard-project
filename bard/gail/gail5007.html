 Following a protracted game of cat-and-mouse the vessels RCS Marathon
Victrix, and RCS <i>Hornet</i> managed to out fox a crew of slow witted
smugglers late yesterday afternoon.<p>
 The engagement began several days earlier when <i>Marathon Victrix</i> and a
pair of Kruytercorp SDBs had picked up a pair of  unidentified vessels
several days earlier.  Failing to respond to the SDB hails the two
vessels attempted to make a run for it.  After a brief engagement which
left little more than smoldering wreckage of one of the vessels the
second attempted to hide out in the rings of Sonnamen, Kruyter's largest
gas giant.<p>
 The search for the second over the next two days and would likely have
continued for several more had it not been for the timely arrival of the
<i>Hornet</i>.  A heavily modified Jayhawk-class far-trader, the <i>Hornet</i> is an
experimental vessel operating under the joint auspices of Hiver Tech and
RCES.  Using one of <i>Hornet</i>'s missiles as a decoy, the ad-hoc task-force
was able to flush the smugglers out and swiftly disable their vessel.
Initial reports indicate that prisoners from the smugglers craft were
brought to Kreuzung Asteroid for interrogation.<p>
 The smugglers ships have been tentatively identified as <i>Nimble Dancer</i>,
a 600 displacement-ton Stellar-class subsidized liner, destroyed in the
initial engagement, and <i>Ellen Arc</i>, a modified 400 ton Petty-class
subsidized merchant.

 Coalition sources on Ra have announce the appearance of a mysterious
plague affecting the Hiver population of Ra's Seabridge nest.  While
details on this illness remain sketchy what is known paints a grim
picture of the future for Hivers throughout the Coalition.  The disease
appears to home in on a number of amino acid chains produced within the
Hivers digestive area re-sequencing these complex proteins into a new
and more lethal substance which immediately begins breaking down the
Hivers body from the inside out.  With a mortality rate in excess of
ninety percent beyond the first two weeks Seabridge Nest's chances for
survival are bleak.<p>
 While there have been no cases of this disease crossing over to Humans,
officials on Ra are taking no chances and have quarantined more than
five-thousand square kilometers around the isolated nest.
 Only specially authorized Coalition representatives are being allowed
in or out of the nest site.<p>

 Early estimates place between 300 and 400 people in the buildings at
the time of the blast with a confirmed 78 people killed and 226
seriously injured.  After more than fifteen hours of intensive searching
Police are holding out little hope of finding more survivors in the

 For the forth time in as many months a train of derelict lifeboats has
drifted into the Spires system from deep space.
"At first we weren't terribly alarmed, said Coalition Navel Commander
Thomas Tom-Cat Caledon, "These things [lifeboats] drift in to every
system from time to time, it's really not all that uncommon given the
magnitude of the final war, but over the last fifteen weeks we've
recovered more than seventy-five lifeboats from an unidentified Solomani
vessel."  Though there have been no survivors recovered to this date we
remain optimistic that survivors will be recovered.
<p>
Though Commander Caledon refused to speculate on the exact nature of
the vessel he did release the following information.
"Given the painted over markings present on all the lifeboats we've
recovered to this date we know that she was originally an Imperial
vessel and given the time and date references  we've recovered, 254/1130,
we feel that there is a very strong possibility for viral infection on
this vessel."<p>
  When asked if he felt that this vessel presented an imminent danger to
the people of the Spires and the Coalition at large Caledon replied,
"Each one of those lifeboats holds twelve people in emergency lowberths
and we're recovering more every day, you do the math Sunshine."<p>

Boarding a Virus-controlled ship or installation is currently against
Reformation Coalition Policy, but in certain
situations, primarily Cold Recoveries, the Viral status may not be known.
<p>
The RCES Office of Technical Information has concluded testing confirming the
utility of personal Contra Grav equipment in situations of Virus-controlled
gravity manipulation.  Note that it remains the official policy of the
Reformation Coalition to not enter a known Virus-controlled ship or
installation.
<p>

GRAV-BELT.

The floor ceiling grav ratio in most Imperial era ships is likely to be 2G to
3 G max.  Grav belts can eliminate
99% of gravity and the floor to ceiling fall ratio would be 0.27m/s<sup>2</sup>, nothing
that will disable a flip over and
reorientation to the new gravity.
<p>
Now back to front on a TL15 ship would allow for a maximum of 6G's
compensation.  This would give a fall rate
of 0.54m/s<sup>2</sup> assuming a grav-belt is utilized.
<p>
A 100 kilo person in a grav belt counteracting 6G's of gravity would only
weigh 6 kilo's.<p>

planet Schotz (1937/So Skire/Old Expanses).  Though the world remains very
reclusive and restricts foreign contact, the Hive Federation has been allowed
to establish a Temporary Base in the outer system, that will enable the

        The Hive Federation Ambassador to the Reformation Coalition announced
that, in conjunction with approval by an Assembly subcommittee, that the Hive
Federation is establishing a permanent J3 trade route connecting the
Reformation Coalition with what has become known as the Sitah "stepping
stone" connecting the Reformation Coalition with the Hiver Federation.  Not
truly organized on an interstellar level, the subsector has benefited from
Hiver technology and uplift efforts and the worlds of region trade amongst
themselves.<P>
        The subsector (Subsector P of Old Expanses Sector) has long
experienced Hiver efforts and is the site for many so called Hiver
"Temporary" Bases.  Hiver J3 merchant ships have previously visited the
Reformation in semi-regular convoys, under protection of ships of the
Federation Navy.<P>
        In an effort to encourage participation on the trade route by the
Reformation Coalition, the Federation Ambassador announced that the Hive
Federation would subsidize Jump 3 merchant designs by Aubaine's Standard
Astrotronics and KeeEEka Strongwall shipyards.<P>
        A junior Oriflammen Assembly representative has derided the offer as
being "useless to Oriflamme" and "another manipulation to keep Aubaine in

        A bill has just been introduced that would fund and authorize contact

relations with the Reformation Coalition and facilitate official Reformation
Coalition endorsement of the Hive Federation's recently established J3 trade
route connecting the Reformation Coalition with the Sitah (Subsector P/Old
Expanses) region.<P>
        Initial commentary has been very muted, but it is expected that
Oriflammen representatives will oppose the measure, as they have a number of
operations ongoing in the "Back Face" of the Coalition, that could be
endangered by official Coalition activity.  Other Centrist and
Pro-Consolidation representatives are expected to favor the measure, and
Federalist sentiments are divided.  Many Aubani representatives wish to see
the Oriflammen "conquest" of the Back Face thwarted, but are dubious in
encouraging the increasing power of the Coalition's central government,
particularly in issues of interstellar trade.<P>
        Other debate has circulated around revising the Primary Area of
Operations to allow full operations in this and other subsectors, but the
issue is expected to be blocked by both Centrist and Federalist leadership,
who are protecting the compromise agreed upon with the founding of the
Coalition.<P>

Normally the Fire Valley, located in northern Quiern Province is a barren
volcanic wasteland, but once every 20 years the Fire Swords bloom giving
the valley its name.  The Fire Swords are a stalky plant about half a
meter tall.  While dormant the plant has no leaves and looks for all
intensive purposes looks to be dead.  This all changes once the plant
begins to bloom. The plant is then covered with dozens of vibrant orange
and red flowers. <P>

All the plants in the valley will bloom at once, carpeting the valley
with fiery blossoms, which gave the valley its name. The blossoms
release a fragrance which humans find very pleasant. The site is reported
to be one of the most beautiful areas in the sector. <P>

The plants then release seeds that sprout and grow into the next generation of plants.
The flowers remain for about 5 weeks, then the plant dies.  The seedlings
grow for about three months before entering their period of dormancy.
Botanists do not fully understand the strange biology of the plant, undoubtedly
because an individual researcher will only be able to study two or three
flowerings in a lifetime.<P>

Fire Swords are only found in the Fire Valley on Shenadoah.  The Fire Valley
is located near the summit of Mt. Kilaeoan, an extinct volcano in the
northern highlands. The Fire Valley is at a height of 3km. There is very
little vegetation other than the Fire Swords and the only animal life are
a few species of birds which nest at the summit.  <P>

Biologists have recently seen the first signs of life returning to the
Fire Swords and expect that the valley will be in full bloom within
three weeks. They are expecting a influx of tourists, as these blooms
have not been seen by offworlders in 80 years. Prospective tourists are
reminded that Fire Valley is a protected area and the introduction of
foreign species is prohibited. The Fire Swords are also protected
and picking or otherwise damaging the plants is  punishable by
fines and imprisonment.<P>

The third vessel will be christened the <I>Flint Morn</I>.  Captain Flint "Deadeye" Morn was
captain of the RC <I>Eos</I>, which was lost with all hands earlier this year when a
Vampire ship attacked Nike Nimbus.   Without Captain Morn's quick actions the loss of life
would have undoubtable been much more than it was.
Captain Morn made the sacrifice that all too many of
young people are being asked to make, so save us from the ravishes of Virus. We must
do our utmost to see that these sacrifices are not if vain.  The ship will be
christened by Captain Trask's sister."

Since the early days of the Third Imperium the Imperial Scout Service
had maintained a Red Zone around Thorell to protect the fragile early tech
level civilization from exploitation by Imperial citizens.  In 1066
under a new policy of public outreach they released a holovideo
showing highlights of the Thorellian culture.  Many of  these pictures
 were taken by  small robotic cameras, so as not to disturb the
Thorellians. This video showed the  Thorellians to be well adapted
to its near-vacuum world, although archaeologists and geologists
maintain the atmosphere was thicker at one time. Thorellians are
a burrowing race, built long and low, with six limbs. They can see
the electromagnetic spectrum from green through microwaves.
<P>
Many interconnecting burrows make up a city, which is synonymous
with  a Thorellian nation. there are at least 300 such nations plus smaller
groupings and loners on the planet. Territorial disputes are common but
usually non-violent.
<P>
During the early days of the Reformation Coalition, the Missisinewa was
sent to contact the Thorellians, and invite them to join the Coalition.
The Missisinewa was unable to find any traces of the Thorellians.  There
were no huge burrow cities or anything else to say the Thorellians ever
existed. The crew of the Missisinewa spent two weeks in a fruitless search
and finally returned home disappointed.
<P>
When the news was released to the general public, speculation to the fate
of the Thorellians was rampant and still is to this day.  Speculation has
ranged from the exotic to the ridiculous  Suggestions have been made that
the Thorellians were exterminated and their civilization wiped out by one
of the sides in the Revolution.  They might have been a high tech race which
had evolved beyond the desire for the display of Technology, and lived at
a much more humble level.  During the Collapse they might have been
endangered and fled to safer territory. Lucan's Imperium was often in
search of Ancient artifacts to further his war, he might have been
convinced that the Thorellians had some secret weapon, and De-populated
the planet in an effort to acquire it. A mad Vampire may have stolen
the population and forced them to be its slaves, the Vampire would of the
used its robot minions to destroy the products of the Thorellian culture.
<P>
None of these explanations are really satisfying.  They all require stretching
the facts and there is no evidence for any of these. In fact the only evidence
for anything, is that the Thorellians are gone.
<P>
The Center for Advanced Study on Oriflamme is planning a scientific
expedition Thorell. They are currently seeking funding for a six month
archaeological investigation of the planet.  Dr Janowsky says "This is one
 of the great mysteries of the Collapse,and needs investigation.  If something
can make an entire species disappear, it may be a threat to us also."

Officials announced today that the government of Lancer has signed a treaty
of alliance with the Coalition. The treaty provides for streamlined trade
and the development of an Auction under Coalition guidelines. The Coalition
will be given priority in purchasing lots, although Lancer retains the right
to appropriate cargo for national development. The treaty also allows for
limited Coalition aid in restructuring Lancer's infrastructure and military
aid.<P>
Although Coalition officials had hoped to encourage Lancer to petition for
membership in the Reform Coalition, Lancerian officials have remained cool
to the idea. Said one official, "We are comfortable with our independence
and not yet prepared to shoulder the burdens that the Coalition has taken
upon itself. However, we have every intention of retaining close ties with
our Coalition neighbors."<P>
Some Coalition officials privately admitted dismay at the degree of
corruption in the Lancer government, which was a major stumbling block in
determining levels of cooperation and integration. Political divisions
within the RC Assembly have also hampered the Coalition's ability to
implement an admission policy -- something that the Lancer government admits
had an impact on heir decision.

After a brief debate over colonial rights, the Assembly overwhelmingly
passed the Admission Bill. The bill, introduced just over a month ago, has
undergone several revisions and additions, becoming a framework for the
enlargement of the Coalition and the gradual inclusion of nearby worlds. SG
Lon Maggart praised the event, proclaiming, "I have waited a long time for
this to happen. This is a shining example of Coalition unity � that we can
work out our lesser differences to promote the greater good. It reinforces
my belief that we can finish the great undertaking we have begun."
<P>
Until last month, political bickering and party schisms prevented a
consensus on the admission of new worlds to the Coalition. However, a
lengthy closed-door session with senior officials produced the first working
copy that could be agreed upon by nearly everyone. The bill has since been
enlarged into a comprehensive plan for the expansion of the Coalition. The
bill mandates that only worlds or sovereign nations upon them can apply for
and receive member status. Applicants who are approved by vote of the
Assembly will gain "Associate" membership. Associate status allows new
worlds to be integrated into Coalition politics and culture over a two-year
period. At the end of that period, the polity can then apply for full
membership or maintain Associate status. Associates would have only observer
(non-voting) status in the Assembly but would have access to Coalition
bootstrap and infrastructure development programs. A greater percentage of
their taxes would go back into their development. This "apprenticeship"
period would be mandatory for all new worlds, unless overruled through a 75%
approval vote of the Assembly.
<P>
The bill also allows for the addition of uninhabited systems through a
process of annexation. Any world without population or proof of ownership
can be annexed by the Coalition with a simple majority vote of the Assembly.
These planets will be administered by the Coalition through the newly-formed
Department of Coalition Resources. This addition sent federalists screaming
about "excessive Coalition control" and nearly scuttled the bill until it's
authority over annexed worlds was loosened. Currently, the administered
territories are considered "Universal Resources" that can be used by any
Coalition members or businesses. Once the planet is colonized to certain
population and infrastructure minimums, the populace could then apply to the
Coalition as an inhabited world.
<P>
Several worlds have contacted the RC about membership, but only two worlds
have been added since the Coalition was formed � Vezina (Aubaine/0437,
D344687-7) and the boneyard of Adrian (Aubaine/0402, D426112-9).

This announcement comes less than a week after the Assembly passed the

Both planets are on the antispinward edge of the Coalition and have been the

Coalition. The recent Admission Bill  has changed all of that and their
requests were quickly put before the Assembly and approved.
Helios sponsored Teldora's membership over five months ago but internal
debate over admission policies prevented the Coalition from responding
effectively. This was also hampered by Teldora's military aid to guerrillas
fighting Oriflammen troops on Spencer, which caused mistrust among members
of the Assembly, particularly the Oriflammen delegates.  Nex has also caused

unacceptable as a form of government in the Coalition.

(Aubaine/0304, X510000-0), Seliga (Aubaine/0610, X532000-0), Conner
(Aubaine/0810, X310000-0), Bestor (Oriflamme/0301, X110000-0), Corrig

(Oriflamme/0503X9A4000-0). All of these worlds are boneyards neighboring the
Coalition. Discussion of the merits of these worlds is expected to continue
for the next few weeks before any final vote is taken.

The Assembly voted today to annex the Buhule system (Aubaine/0304,
X510000-0).
<P>
Several other worlds are also under consideration for annexation, but a
consensus was reached with little opposition on Buhule. According to Fijan
Assemblyperson Erin Ishidar, "We have a vested interest in Buhule � there is
already a strong Coalition presence in the system. Annexing the world is
merely acknowledging our presence there." The Lacroix& Davenport salvage
company has been working the Buhule system for over two years and has a
permanent staff of over 75 people there. In the past few months, several
other salvage teams have added their presence. Transstar has also made a
presence there, providing supplies and transportation to the salvage
operations.
<P>
The addition of Buhule brings the total number of Coalition worlds to [22?].

The Assembly voted today on the annexation of six boneyards into the
Coalition: Seliga (Aubaine/0610, X532000-0), Conner (Aubaine/0810,
X310000-0), Bestor (Oriflamme/0301, X110000-0), Corrig

(Oriflamme/0503X9A4000-0). The Assembly approved the annexation of all of
these planets.
<P>
These worlds will be administered territories of the Coalition. Resources on
these planets are available to anybody under the Coalition salvage code. The
Department of Coalition Resources says it expects to have navigational
beacons placed in these systems within the next couple of months. No other
infrastructure is planned at this time.

<B>KEYWORDS: RCN, BRILLIANT LANCES, KRUYTER </b><BR>
reported by <A  HREF="../../credits.html#Platte">Kyle Platte</A><p>

Yesterday, in a small press conference on Kruyter Starport, Commander Jay
Hayes announced that Project Brilliant Lances was well behind its original
schedule due to numerous labor and supply shortages. Commander Hayes
admitted it was "highly unlikely" that they would be able to meet their
planned completion date of 01/II/1203. "We have nearly everything in place
now: it's only a matter of putting on a few final touches and calibrating
the systems." The facility's opening date has been pushed back to
10/III/1203.
<P>
Today, a handful of government officials and reporters toured the new
facility on the third moon of Kruyter's far gas giant, Sonnamen. The
facility appeared functional but there were unpainted rooms and hallways and
unsecured wiring through much of the facility. The base has been inhabited
by technical crews for several weeks as they finish assembling the computers
and related systems. Commander Hays gave a brief demonstration of the sensor
network and ran a mock duel with five simulated starships around the gas
giant.
<P>
The Brilliant Lances Training Facility has become increasingly important in
the Navy's mind as large-scale conflict with the Soleean Empire grows ever
more likely. It will also be used to train Coalition allies and freelancers
to work closely with Coalition forces.

IISHURISH, TELDORA (Oriflamme/0607, D5548AC-9), 19/XII/1202 <B>KEYWORDS:
TELDORA, COALITION MEMBERS, LON MAGGART</b><BR>
reported by <A  HREF="../../credits.html#Platte">Kyle Platte</A><p>

Standing before an estimated crowd of over 90,000 people, SG Lon Maggart
addressed the citizens of Teldora and thanked them for the wisdom of their
decision. Speaking of unity and a bright future, the SG said, "You are the
first, the heralds of tomorrow and your choice is the highest praise the
Coalition can receive. I work towards the goal that we will live up to the
faith you have put in us."
<P>
The people in the crown were mainly positive, voicing the opinion that the
Coalition was the best chance for short-term safety and long-term
prosperity. Many also spoke of the energetic charisma of the SG. This was
summed up in a statement heard in the crowd, to hell with the Coalition,
I'm following' THAT man!"  There was an undertone of negativism as well.
Some citizens see Teldora's admission as the easiest way to thwart
Oriflammen aggression in the area, which the planet is ill-prepared to
handle. A woman interviewed after the speech said, "I don't want to be in
the Coalition: I don't want to waste my tax money killing people on other
planets. We have plenty of problems rebuilding here. But I don't want to
look over my shoulder every day for the Flamer dropships, either. This is a
compromise I guess I have to live with."
<P>
Teldora is the first inhabited world to be admitted to the Coalition and is
popularly seen as the end of a major stumbling block in Coalition politics:
the admission of new worlds. Nex is the next world to be admitted and
sources on Aubaine say there are others being considered.

The Coalition has already begun setting up offices and preparing to
integrate Teldora into Coalition society. Teldora will be an Associate
member of the Coalition for the next two years, with greater autonomy and
moderated interaction with Coalition government. Although they will not have
a vote in Assembly decisions, they are allowed to observe and take part in
the discussions. After the two year period has expired, the Coalition
Assembly will vote to allow Teldora member status, continue Associate
status, or expel them from the Coalition.
<P>
SG Lon Maggart is expected to stay here several days, touring the planet and
meeting with various officials. Advance teams are already examining the
existing infrastructure so that a comprehensive  plan for rebuilding and
integration can be developed. After his stay, the SG will take the Fairfax
to Nex for their admission ceremonies, to be held in three weeks.
