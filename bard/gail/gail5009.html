<P>
The world Atrase /Aubaine 0131/(E-68A212-4) Old Expanses is classified as TDO (trade and diplomatic only) from the RC Assembly of Worlds today. Henceforth, SAG missions are strictly forbidden. After contact from DLS Helios, on of the missing 12 Dawn Traders, the follow on mission by CPT Senta "Boom-Boom" Romero & the RCS Mary Ellen Carter, and two months ago Bootstrap Operations have begun, two teams from Fija & Trybec have been dispatched to see how soon they can bring this former TL-12 world "back on line". Transstar Lines has been instrumental in shipping large quantities of construction machinery (earth movers, poly-crete/ cement mixers, etc). Dawn Construction Yards of Trybec has laid claim to the old Star port, and expects to have it at B- Status in a mere 1.5 years! Landing beacons have already been emplaced, according to CPT Romero, as well as those set into orbit.
RCSA Commissioner for External Development, Khamyannah Arsto of Fija, says,"(this world) is a primary example of what we can do for re-claiming the wilds," after disembarking at Trybec's Downport Central today. "Not only are we preserving and advancing ourselves from relic technology, but we can use the excess to advance others onto the road back to the stars ourselves."

<P>
    It is with great reluctance & sadness that CDRE Lathrop reported today that the following vessels are "Missing-Fate Unknown", including his old flagship, the veteran crewed Broadsword-class Mercenary cruiser, RCSNR Ashtabula,  & the Victrix-class Sloop, RCSNR Ember-Victrix. Both vessels were operating in the Khulam Main within the AO, searching for the ships & crews of the missing Dawn traders. They join the list of MFU's, as RCES & RCN calls them, to include the other Broadsword Merc.cruiser, RCSNR Missinewa, and four Victrix sloops, RCSNR Kukulkan-Victrix, Mirabilis-Victrix, Muan Gwi-Victrix, & Valeria Victrix, and the RCS Taylor the Bruce, a modified Petty class Subsidized liner, that were lost last year after the initial RC response to the loss of the 12 Dawn traders in early 1200. These vessels were lost in the line of duty, most, if not all were searching the Adjacent subsectors to the Coalition for the missing Twelve unaccounted for.<P>
	Former Skippers of the Ashtabula, CDRE Sean "Hammer" Lathrop & CDR Pat "Who-Me?" Ritter vowed publicly they, "would find the Ashtabula & never rest until the ship & crew's fates were ascertained." Some twelve or so former members of the vaunted cruiser remain in service, and have sworn the oath as well.

<P>
 A derelict 400 displacement ton Trenchant-class Patrol Cruiser, the Rhyvik, was repaired and jumped back from the Agiruur system by a prize crew from the Carson class scout ship RCS Tryfydd-Slayer, Commanded by one LTCDR Sean "Lucky-Dice" Egan, RCES, out of Aubaine, XO, RCES Scout Edward "Ed-Dee" Duugamiisha..
"Aboard her were 18 of the original 22 crew members, low berthed since the Collapse, about 256-1130, according to her logs," Egan </B><BR>reported.  The commanding officer is a remnant from the Federation of Daibei Federal Navy, one LTCDR Maria Ulianov, who claims to hail from the planet of Ghost, in Reaver's Deep Sector. Translators astonishingly, had to be utilized for the rest of the crew, not of the former FDN, but civilians, of the minor race of humaniti known as Ayanshi, natives of Ghost.  They were all enthusiastic at being rescued, and after being debriefed volunteered enmasse to join RCES, once they were debriefed as to the Coalition's goals & aims were on the condition they served together, and on their ship. They apparently likened the RC to the Federation of Daibei, which served the people first, unlike other factions of the Final War.
<P>
      The Rhyvik 's computers were infected and damaged, but her drives were otherwise intact, Egan added. "She was circling the gas giant, intakes open, purifying plant still running, keeping her fueled and powered down low. Dunno how they rigged that, but it worked." Rhyvik it turns out is Ayanshi for Osprey. Unlike other models built prior to the collapse, the Osprey, as she has been re-christened, was equipped with 4x 150 Mj triple Laser turrets, and the low berths placed in the missile magazine.  Egan was promoted to CDR for this daring rescue, and was appointed the skipper of the RCSNR Osprey, while it is grounded for repairs  & recalibration of her drives.

<P>
    It was released to day in a brief press conference that the RMS MacKenzie was declared lost, over due by Majestic Survey& Relic Recovery Consortium, Ltd of Nike Nimbus, according to Aubani VP Midori Chouinard.  With one vessel nearing completion at Bourgund SY, Oriflamme, Majestic Survey is in dire straits with the loss of their only in service vessel. The MacKenzie is an A2-S (stretch) Jayhawk- class Far Trader, limited edition-a 300dton displacement model, of which only 300 were made in the Old Expanses-Diaspora sectors of space under IDP 1117-1129. Those wishing to inquire about seeking & rescuing said ship & crew thereof, may contact Ms Chouinard at the Brusman Ritz-Carlton, near the Starport.

Keipes (the fourth Imperium) announces the release of the captured RC personnel as a good-will action and beginning of successful diplomatic contact, by RC Special Envoy, Ms Usamda Kuuvishaam, who was aboard the Jayhawk-class Far Trader SS Reluctant Explorer, Captained by the colorful, but eloquent CPT Orso Gorzini, escorted by the armed Carson-class Scout ship, RCSNR Tryffyd-slayer & RCSNR Green Hornet, a relic Gazelle-class Close Escort. Tryffyd-slayer & Green Hornet & DLS Eos arrived at Auroran-RC Naval base at 0900 hrs this morning. Both Tryffyd-slayer & Green Hornet are RCES vessels & crews, though the CO of the GH, One Edward "Crazy-Eddy"Duugamiisha, of Vrasstadt (Aubaine/Aubaine) does own most of his ship shares. The mission, facing superior numbers of   Keipan Space forces however, went off without violence, ironically enough after two attempts by force failed against the Keipan planetary meson gun & Air defenses. Both RCES vessels remained in orbit while the talks were underway dirt side. <P>
      Ms Kuuvishaam had the following to say to our reporter aboard the Green Hornet: " We received an official message of Grand Duke Eledo of Keipes, in which he announced, "the release of all captured RC personnel (crews of the DLS Eos & RCS Trigger). They may decide whether to stay on Keipes as guests or be transported back to the RC."
     All accusations & charges of piracy & espionage against them were dropped because of a general amnesty; our sources on the planet </B><BR>reported, after the coup de tat that followed the death of the Arch Vicar Tekim Hsun, Grand master of the Order of Know-ledge barely a month ago. Also at issue was the return of the DLS Eos, currently pressed into the "High-guard" Forces of the planet. On this matter, the Keipan  "4th Imperium" govt was reasonable, and, "bargains for technological assistance, in return for the vessel", as is, from their "other brothers from the stars."
     Ms Kuuvishaam boarded RC Courier, RCS Balthasar-Victrix after her brief press conference, bound for Aubaine. The released crews of the Trigger & Eos were given a Heroes' welcome, and were sent to RC Naval HQ for debriefing. Ten of the 12-man crew of the Eos survived captivity, and eight of the fifteen landing party from Trigger survived.  The DLS Eos, battered but serviceable, will undergo a refit before being returned to Trybec, its port of origin, back in 1199.
	CPT Gorzini's vessel did not accompany the RCES mission homeward. Of him, CPT Duugamiisha said, "Him? He's a mad hatter, & I like 'im! Reminds me of me when I grow up!" An undisclosed amount of reward credits was promptly placed into the Skipper's of the two RCES vessels hands after the news conference & briefings. "Now," CPT "Crazy-Eddy" said, "its Miller Time!"

The world Keipes /Aubaine 0312/(B-677884-6) Old Expanses receives a temporary special state and is classified as TDO (trade and diplomatic only) from the RC Assembly of Worlds today. Henceforth, SAG missions are strictly forbidden. This message was made by the RCSA without further explanation, but follows on the heels of the dramatic diplomatic efforts of RCSA Envoy Ms Usamda Kuuvishaam of Aubaine several weeks ago that secured by peaceful means what force twice had not achieved.
	In related News, The DLS Eos arrived in Trybec's Dawn Construction Yards under her own power with the combined crews from the Trigger & Eos. A Stellar-class liner, plans for her conversion to an EMMC (Extemporized Mercantile to Military Conversion), like her sister ship, the RCNRS Angor Wat, are in the works for her.  As there is another vessel named for the once thought lost forever Eos, (an Aurora-class II clipper), she will be re-christened the RCNRS Nec Aspera Terrent, which in the Terran Latin, means "No fear on Earth". She will be up gunned to two 120Mj laser turrets, 2x Msl turrets, (1x starboard, 1x portside) and two Sandcaster turrets (Throat (bow) & Stern) with two MFD's.

</B><BR>reported by <A  HREF="../../credits.html#Devlin">Liam Devlin</A>
<P>
  Four weeks ago, the Ascetic Mystic Dictator of Futok, known to off-world traders as only "The Prophet" awoke and declared another divine vision from God: "A conspiracy was afoot to assassinate him from off planet, and the infidels must be stopped."<P>
 Futok's two Revolutionary Guard Battalions immediately stormed & sealed the New Antioch C-class starport and nearby Desalinization plant, impounding all starships & imprisoning all Crews of both Guild, Free Trader & RCES that were in port. This news brought to us here by CPT Orso Gorzini who narrowly avoided capture as he was on his final approach. Eight Daytona-class TL-10 AzHRAE powered Orbital interceptors were scrambled to catch him before he cleared the Gravity well, but CPT Gorzini barely managed to evade them. Gorzini made his report upon safe harbor at Trybec's Dawn Base, last week.
     Caught on the ground were three ships, one Guilder, MGS The Filthy Lucre, a Sundowner-class Far Trader (400dtons), one Free Trader, the SS Vyborg-Saxe, a Tukera Long Liner (1000dtons) and the RMS Harbinger., an A2S "Jayhawk" Far Trader (300dtons). Harbinger was bringing tools and materials to the bootstrap team repairing New Antioch's desalinization plant by the starport. Aboard Harbinger were RCSA Special Envoy Ms Usamda Kuuvishaam, and her staff of six. Harbinger's crew are all from Lucifer, including her captain. Some twenty to twenty five workers for Trybec Corp were dirtside when the Round-ups began.
	All merchant traffic headed for Khulam Subsector are hereby put on notice to avoid landing on Futok, until lifted. Futok falls under the restricted class until the RCN or RCES COO's say otherwise.

<P>
    With the return of the RCNS Aube (10071 tailfin No) after 14 weeks in space, CPT Cynta "Sinner" Lawter arrived at Trybec Orbital today along with CPT James "Full House" Roger of the RCS Nightwatcher, CPT Sean "Lucky-Dice" Egan, of the RCNRS Osprey, Col Cori Sterns & her Star Mercs, the "Battle Angels" in the RCNRS Patuxuent, and the crew & battered but proud Dawn League ship, DLS Brilliant. Outside of the furor sure to be raised in this joyous moment for operating outside of the Primary AO, the facts are these:
     Using information from a Wilds Free Trader, one CPT Arlwin  "Sam" Sam, of the SS Wandering Star, [a relic Highlander-class "Wilds" trader (500dtons, J3/3G)] that was nearly a year old, CPT Lawter took her Task force, piggy-backing Nightwatcher, escorted by the Patrol Cruiser RCNRS Osprey (J4/4G) & Broadsword-class Mercenary Cruiser RCNRS Patuxuent (equipped with J3/2G drives) in a daring J-3 dash into the "Vampire Hwy", seven parsecs into the Outer wilds to Asena, now called Isis (0322/Promise/Diaspora).
     "The Brilliant misjumped into Isis, and was seized by the TED, one Duke Joseph Erstwhile trying to find parts for the damaged drives. This Beres, who apparently deals with the Vampire ships, and had intended to dispose of the crew of the Brilliant to the next one that made planet fall, after the crew proved recalcitrant, and refused to hand over the code to unlock the bridge.
     <P>
    "It was another textbook case for telling 'Teddy' his day was done, "CPT Lawter said in a terse interview. "Full house" gave us the over-watch & keyed in all pre-targeting data of Teddy's forces around the prison while the initial Ground team did a recon around Starkar city. Once we found those opposed to this thug, we made another discovery." With that, CPT Lawter gave the mike to Col Sterns.
    <P>
  "My Scouts found the remnants of another Star Merc organization, rotating in low berths, once called "Gunnar's Grunts", and we hooked up with them and the local resistance leaders and cooked a plan to rescue the PWs and retake the Brilliant. Turns out it was easier than we planned. We set up dirtside with our troopers (x40, all TL-10 equipped/armored), & re-equipped Col Marissa Hamling's Battalion (!) with ammo, and called the "Patuxuent down to this E-class field, a pockmarked airstrip if I ever saw one, pretending to be a Vampire ship.
    "Well Teddy Beres comes out with his TL-13 Solomani Grav Tank and 24 studs in TL-12 Red Imperial battledress to meet it, and we ambushed them, with Osprey acting as close air support.  Patuxuent's lasers cut that jumped up Grav sled into Spiri cheese, probably killing Beres outright. Osprey dropped two Spruce missiles amidst the Scarlet Guards and woomf, they were down!"<P>
"Aube's RCMC drop troops hit the silk in the predawn hours and stormed the E-port in a coordinated assault, capturing the planet's sole SDB, a 400dton TL-12 Jackal-class N-PAW packing 4G rated Sig Delt, mass produced in these parts during the Hard Times. Sure glad it was down for repairs."
"Then His Grace's Cavalry rode up, and Col Hamling's troops mopped the floor with em. The Musket bearing troops Bere's had dropped 'em and ran. All over but the Shouting N crying at that point."
<P>
	The Mixed RCMC, Lancer, RCES, Star Merc forces liberated the planet much like Vezina was in 1200. Unfortunately, the planet lies well beyond the AO, and immediate support is out of the question for now. They are expecting another Vampire Convoy in little less than a year.  One, Nathan Stano, is the leader of the planet now that Bere's forces have been smashed.  He requests aide to repel the vampires and technical support to reclaim the many relics that dot the planet.  A repair team did fix the SDB's maneuver drives & FPP leak for the Asenan's as they call themselves. Several TL-10 Oracle computers were distributed by Chaplain Konstantin Bognardskii of the church of the Aspects (Trybec). Though not nearly enough, they will be of great assistance with their databases to return lost knowledge back to the Wilds.
<P>
Col Marissa Hamling & "Gunnar's Grunts" were transported back to Coalition space, where it seems, they will be merged with now Brigadier Cori Sterns' "Battle Angels" Star Merc "Brigade" (Hamling's Gunnar's Grunts adds another full Battalion of 480 troops to her existing BN.), bringing their strength to 3 full Bns (15 company sized units).
Rescued were CPT/Astrogator Anna "Aye-Kay" Kaul, of Aurora (HTI grad class '96), First Officer Tarin "No One" Nadir, Electronics Officer Qarsan "Ballast" Balashu, both of Baldur (HTI grads class of 98), Gunners Laura "Deadeye" Berg of Oriflamme & Helen "Heckle" Eklund of Fija (HTI grads class of 97)& Ship's Dr/Steward Theore "Toga" Romans of Spires (HTI grad '96).  Ship's Engineering Officer, Wayne "Moon-Man" Mullins of Eos, was placed under formal arrest, for collaborating with a hostile power to the Coalition for self gain & aggrandizement. If convicted, he could get life in prison at Starhelm, in the Kruyter system.
<P>
The Battle Angels are a "Lancer group" based out of Lancer (grid 0439/ D-55A746-7)/Aubaine/ Old Expanses & Aubaine. Col Sterns decided to start small, and recruited half dozen soldiers that she had met while on Vras, and so the Battle Angels were formed in 1197. Since then she has come to view herself as a citizen of the entire Reformation Coalition and not as a citizen of any individual member world. The differences between individual worlds are minute when compared to the chaos of the Wilds. The Battle Angels served aboard ships as security forces, provided escorts for land convoys, and other missions. For the first few years the Battle Angels did not make a great deal of money, but they built a reputation as small highly trained group that was completely trustworthy.
In 1200 when the Twelve were declared lost, Cori realized that the Dawn League was not equipped to deal with the chaos of the Wilds. She decided to expand the Angels; with a larger force they would be able to take on more important missions. She envisions the Angels as an elite unit with several battalions. They will specialize in assault missions and special operations against high value targets. Missions such as smash and grabs, decapitation raids, search and destroy etc. are the Battle Angels specialties. They will not take on missions such as garrison duty or peacekeeping. They would be willing to take on training cadre missions if no other jobs were available, or if they needed time to recover from a particularly dangerous mission. <P>
The Angel's emphasize honor and ethics in their behavior. Brigadier Sterns will only hire out the Angels to legitimate governments, or other organizations she finds worthy. She is the one who decides if a government is legitimate or not. The government must enjoy some amount of popular support, and must not be extremely cruel to its citizens. She views herself as a citizen of the Coalition, so she will not take on missions, which prove harmful to the RC. She would also be willing to hire out to nongovernmental organizations such as a corporation or a group of Free Traders if they were having difficulty with a criminal organization such as a band of pirates. The Angels will not engage in looting or attacks against unarmed citizens. Brigadier Sterns has them use the former Imperial Marine Grey outfits and rank insignia, to the distaste of some RCES personnel. Their record to date, despite their detractors, has been a successful one. This also marks the largest cold recovery of remnants (over 450) from Low berths to date in an RCES operation

RCES covert operatives sent the following report on the situation on Futok (####) C-564796-7 / Khulam/Diaspora) out via RCS Marissa from their hideout on planetside, two weeks ago, CDR Saffron Ghulz, commanding.
	RCS Harbinger surrendered without violence, the crews of the Vyborg-Saxe & Mercantile Guild ship Filthy Lucre varied in their responses to the seizures.  The cargo handler Guilders made a show of force,  and fired a few shots over the heads of the Revolutionary guards with pistols, and were mowed down by 2cm vehicle mounted LAG's. Those not slain outright were beheaded. Intel reported a crew of 22 for that vessel.  The Vyborg Saxe buttoned up, and was strafed by the Orbital interceptors returning empty-handed from chasing off an incoming starship. Only when tanks surrounded the ship, did the Aadmodt-Kjuss family yield their home & ship. Some 54 of this plucky family were incarcerated, along with the three surviving Guilders.
"The Prophet", once known as Ahmad ibn Khomeni, went out onto his Presidential balcony, once an opulent Mansion to the former ruler, (a TED he overthrew five years ago, Shah Ismail al Nasr) now a stark white-washed spartan building, part house, office and temple of the Church of the Word of God, to chanting crowds of frenzied sycophants and declared, "the Off-world plot had been thwarted. Now the infidels who sought (his) death, and cessation of his divinely inspired leadership, must be weighed in the balance. The guilty shall be tried, and on the seventh day after a chance to cleanse their souls, be executed as The Word demands, swiftly. "For those that live by the Sword, and seek murder in the night, shall perish thereof"." Trials were set to begin 23/V/1201.
The RCSA's response was short and quick. Orders were dispatched to the Fleet & RCMC.  Both of the Battle Angel's Broadsword-class Mercenary cruiser vessels, RCS Patuxuent & Caloosahatchee, as well as the EMMC ship, RCSNR Nec Aspera Terrent  (formerly known as the DLS Eos) also lifted from port today. Leaving with them, the RCNS Thunderchild, RCS Marathon Victrix, and the LMCV, RCS Lirgishkhunan.

The CIN media as well as local TrybecCorp journalists crowded the Trybec Downport as shuttle after shuttle of rescued RCES workers and RCSA diplomats returned planetside for a news conference.
	CPT Pat "Who Me?" Ritter summed up this occasion with his droll usual style:
"You heard of the Six-Day-War, And the 100 Hour War of old Terra in history?  This was the 'Sixteen Minute Spanking the Futok-ing Goat Rodeo'."
<P>
According to interviews from crewmen as the fleet made port in system, Intel gathered by a ground team from RCS Marissa (CPT Saffron Ghulz) in the two weeks, allowed for all ground strike missile bearing ships to reduce the Futok Air force & Armored units in their laagered yards to be reduced to scrap in under nine minutes. The 1x company of drop troops from Brigadier General Cori Stern's Battle Angels secured the Starport, and took the surrender of the shell-shocked 300 lightly armed personnel there.  Six TL-7 T-62 Tanks gave brief resistance but Marathon-Victrix swooped "down-on-the-deck" and her plasma guns made short work of this unforeseen threat.<P>
	Elsewhere, The Revolutionary Guards Bn, surrounding the New Antioch Prison, found themselves  up against the 1st Coy, Nimban 2nd Armor "Hell's A Poppin'", in their Trepida IIa HvCPR gunned grav tanks that descended from orbit to surround them ! And  two companies of RCMC flowed close on their heels, to liberate 29x RCES/RCSA personnel, 54x Free traders of the Aadmodt-Kjuss family (SS Vyborg-Saxe), and three Guild merchant personnel (MGS Filthy Lucre)
	No less than two Spruce missiles, according to veteran reporter <A  HREF="../../credits.html#Devlin">Liam Devlin</A>'s account, flattened the Prophet's mansion. As he was live on local TV from that site, he was undoubtedly slain in the attack.<P>
	The Free Traders were allowed to repair their ship, under the auspices of BG Stern's StarMercs, who remain in system , with both their ships. Also on Station, RCS Marissa, and RCSNR Nec Aspera Terrent  Casualties for the Coalition were mercifully light, eighteen wounded, none seriously. The Filthy Lucre had a prize crew placed aboard her, and accompanied the Fleet elements of  "TF Free-Futok!"
	RCSA Special Envoy Usamda Kuuvishaam spoke briefly, but thanked, "the Brave men & women who risked all for the freedom of not just themselves, but the planet of Futok from a paranoid madman. May God have mercy on his soul."
	It remains unclear who will succeed in the wake of Prophet Khomeni' s death in the power vacuum on Futok, as the religion of the church of the Word of God is planet wide. Several Merchant corporations & Populist elite, who welcomed the change from 66 years of tyranny of the TED dynasty "The Prophet" brought, are not likely to select another theocracy clergy-run government, it is suspected. Or if they do, a more moderate, less xenophobic branch of the Faith may ascend.<P>
	Futok has 20 million people, and lies two parsecs from the Khulam Main. While formerly TL-10, it was not on the official RCES agenda of re-contacting. Its C-class Starport welcomed off world interests, if nowhere else on this insular, TL-7 world.

  Gun cam tapes provided by Egan and his crew confirm the existence of this xenomorph, which is parasitical in biology, needing a living host to reach adult status.<P>
"They was real mad, but sorta glad we solved that mystery fer them," Duugamiisha said. " Of course the Guild skipper Pankerowski, didn't listen to us, I'm afraid his ship took a bit of a knocking that close to the blast. We towed him to port though, for a nominal fee!"<P>
Due to the nature of the agreement, & the conduct of the RCES personnel aiding the beleaguered Guild vessel, the Bruhamen government has declared the Guild's trading days with them at an end, & has decided to trade with the Coalition only.  Henceforth, Meadsk and Xezor are declared off limits to SAG raiding, and granted TDO privileges forthwith.

From urban New Antioch, to the Mahmoud Jungles, and the Teriq Aziz Desert, Futok has held its first ever-free elections, under the watchful eyes of TF-Promote-Liberty, (RCS Marissa, RCSNR Nec Aspera Terrent, RCS Patuxuent, & RCS Caloosahatchee) as well as the Free Trader SS Vyborg-Saxe. A Trilateral Republic was created today, from the Merchant & Intelligentsia-classes & the Church. Moneyed interests rest in the House of Business, From the Scholarly classes (teachers, doctors, engineers, scientists), the House of Knowledge. The Church is the Judiciary branch, applying the Word of God to legislation as a testament to its constitutionality. Former Starport Marshal Jamal ibn Hussein was elected by majority vote by the Bedouin(nomads of the Teriq Aziz desert) & Fellahin (farmers), after two compromise candidates from the Church and HoB failed to get even a consensus vote of confidence.<P>
	Hussein had surrendered the Starport wisely, sparing his men a month ago, to BG Stern's Battle Angels, rather than foolishly throw away  their lives. His leadership in re-organizing the city's government in the interim as well as Bedouin heritage (his mother's side) made him the best candidate for the job. As the new Prime Minister he has two months to assemble a candidate, which must be approved by all three houses.  A reformist with a cool head in times of stress, Hussein joined the first joint session of the Trilateral republic with Prayer for the dead, the living, and the unborn. <P>
	"The past is past. We dare not look backwards, nor stand still. The mercy of those who came in the name of justice with the fury of the Angels is evident today. Here we decide our fates, not they. As free men & women, under God's Word, and as indivisible as the Trinity, for those who have perished, and look down upon us from heaven, we mourn they are not here to cry & share this joy. That is for we, the living to do. And for those yet unborn, we hold it our sacred duty to teach and uplift. Amen."

	RCSA authorities declared a state of TDO for Futok by a rare unanimous vote from both Federalist & Centrist parties.

In a slow day at Eos RCES Base the sensor techs got a surprise masered message from the now, six-ship convoy of Jumping-Jack Flash I.S. & M, Ltd.
"Clear the Starport we're coming in for a Selly-bray-shun! Ed-Dee, out!"
Returning from an RCES sponsored SAG mission to Lote, (0229/ X-77A66B-3/Thoezennt/Old Expanses), dirtside, and the plucky crews of this New Era entrepreneurs have once again come through with a bonus. This time, a 3-kiloton displacement former Solomani Hospital ship, SCNS Mercy. One sole "Dave" was recovered with this, a cybernetically enhanced individual by one of the two virally controlled computers aboard. Ironically, he calls himself "Cyber-Dave".
After debriefing, it was also gleaned by this reporter that the surface SAG raid upon the "old Man of the Mountain" was successful, as well as the attack on the Virus-controlled remnant of the former B-class orbital Star port & Naval yard. The Coalition has gained vital relic technology in the way of TL-14 densitometers, and neural activity sensors, and countless other artifacts useful for re-outfitting RCES survey vessels & drones. Also available at Auction was a TL-15 Grav Speeder, two TL-14 air-rafts. JJFIS&M kept the 7x suits of TL-14 Imperial Battledress, and 7x FGMP-14's, and laid claim to the Mercy.<P>
Numerous large-hulled ships, still tied up have been filed as claims. Transstar offices have been notified, for salvage rights. Of note as well, six of twelve Pre-collapse assigned Jackal-class 400 displacement ton SDB's have been recovered from their submerged bases, Virus free. As might be expected, stock shares in JJFIS&M rose accordingly, at the Eos-Nike Exchange closing at an all out high.<P>
Said CPT Egan, after making planet fall, "Just another credit owed to good planning, good ships, good training, and the best damn crew this side of the Wilds!"

Ships purchased from JJFIS &M, Ltd by Transstar, LCC, arrived in port today for refitting & repair. Piggy-backed from Lote on the 3 kiloton Tasadian Freight hauler, "TSS Grappler", five relic 1-kiloton displacement Starhauler-class merchant ships.  These behemoths resemble the Petty class Subsidized freighters of the Pre-collapse era in shape, yet are considerably larger Air-framed hulls. KruyterCorp already has one such in use (LEASED FROM Transstar), the KMS Godzilla, named for a Solomani 2D vid creature. Called the BUFF class by its crew (Big Ugly Flying F@@K), these former Imperial made ships were for those J-3 cross lanes throughout the former Imperium' s Mains. <P>
	One of these has been purchased by a wealthy Luhtalan Star Merchant, Victor von Hugo owner of BTG (Beyond the Grave) Salvage, LCC, and will be christened LMS Frankenstein, after refit.

</B><BR>reported by <A  HREF="../../credits.html#Devlin">Liam Devlin</A> & Lewis Roberts.
<P>
Questions concerning the destruction of a vampire infected ship near the So Skire Bootstrap world three weeks ago were answered today in a press release by Delgado-Delgado: Information Technologies, a subsidiary PR firm of Delgado & Dushgin, LCC. The mysterious anti-Virus group, the Templars, made credit for the kill on the Viral Mercenary cruiser ISS Glamdring. Who are they, the public has asked?<P>
     "The Templars are a fighting order dedicated to the elimination of Virus. Armand Sourez, an elderly Aubani billionaire, formed them in 1196. Armand was a teen when Virus swept away civilization. He saw his home destroyed and his parents killed. The effects were unbearable to the youth Armand and it crippled him emotionally. He became very detached and focused all his energy on expanding his sizable inheritance. The Collapse devastated the economy of Aubaine, but he was able to take advantage of other's misfortune. His fortune grew in spite of the Collapse. He never had the time, or desire for a family. Armand welcomed the creation of the Dawn League, and went on to helped fund the DLS Brilliant and the DLS Dawn on their recontact missions. When the Twelve went missing, he started to suspect that Virus was still a danger. Sending out operatives to see if Virus was still around, he was not surprised when the operatives came back and confirmed that Virus was still a threat. Armand was incensed by this, and decided to take action. With several military officers, who felt as Armand did, he founded the Templars. He has endowed the Templars with his entire fortune, which, as Armand is considered one of the five wealthiest men on Aubaine, is quite considerable." <P>
The Templars soon began to recruit members. They offer lifelong employment, as long as the recruit was willing and able to fight any and all signs of Virus. Like the Terran French Foreign Legion of Pre-Diasporan history, the Templars do not care about past crimes; all that is required is the desire to fight Virus. The Templars are paid a small monthly salary of 100 Aubani Credits plus room and board. The Templars live under strict military discipline, and recruits are trained in many different skills to use in the fight against Virus. In the early days of the organization, the recruits were trained in a broad number of skills, but as the organization grew, its members began to specialize more and more.
The organization plans on taking care of its members for life. Elderly Templars will be used as trainers, advisors and desk workers. Templars that are too feeble to work, or that have been crippled in battle will be given a comfortable retirement in the Coalition at a rest home owned by the organization. The Templars plan on setting up special rest homes, as needed, but they don't plan on have any members needing to retire for decades. <P>
The Templars have a base somewhere trailing of the Coalition, but The Templars keep the base's location a secret in case Virus has human allies who might betray them. This base is rather small currently. It is equipped with barracks and facilities for several thousand troops and a small landing pad for starships. The Templars are equipped mostly with TL-10 equipment with scattered TL-11 equipment. While the current TL on Aubaine is 12, the RC military has bought up most of the TL-12 and Tl-11 equipment and there is little left for private groups. As it becomes available the group plans to upgrade its equipment. The Templars </B><BR>reportedly have several dozen Tl-10 tracked tanks and AFVs; however, the Templars lack a means of transporting the equipment from orbit to the field. The Templars are trying to acquire a troop transport. They have also looked into buying a Dawn Clipper, and a Warlock SDB, our sources on Oriflamme have told us. <P>
The group currently has three starships, two Patrol Cruisers, the RCMS Bloodhound & RCMS Relentless, and a Fer-de-Lance Destroyer Escort, RCMS Mjolnir. However, the Templars are actively seeking new warships. Almost all recovered military technology offered at Auction is taken by the military, but the Templars try to get around this, by purchasing items outside the RC, primarily on Lancer & Kal. Since the item isn't offered at Auction, the seller does not have to pay a host cut, and on a multi-million credit sale this can add up to a significant profit. Recovered technology that hasn't gone through the Auction process cannot be brought into the RC, but, "the Templars don't want to bring its ships inside of the RC, they want to fight Virus, and Virus is out in the Wilds," insisted The DDIT spokesman to these reporters.
A Commandant, who is currently ex-Field Marshall Oskar Kelkon, formerly of the Oriflamme Special Forces, leads the Templars. A circle of twelve officers advises the Commandant. The Templars divide their forces into two groups. The Star Troops crew the ships, and act as ground troops. About 90% of the Templars are Star Troops. The Star Troops also provide the logistics and supply support for themselves Templars. The remaining 10% are the Scouts. The Scouts are constantly on the lookout for signs of Virus infestations. Mssr Armand Sourez still takes an active role in the organization. He has (wisely) turned over the military planning to seasoned warriors, such as Commandant Kelkon, but he is still engaged in long range planning. He also busies himself in increasing support for the Templars within the Coalition. He has hired an Aubani PR firm, to increase awareness and acceptance of the Templars goals. This is also tied into a large-scale recruitment drive. <P>
Officially, the RC has no position on the Templars; they are considered just another, "Lancer" mercenary organization. Unofficially, they have many sympathizers both in the RCSA government, the RCN and the RCES. It is speculated that these sympathizers often clue the Templars onto leads of new Virus infestations, and the Templars often share with these allies about Virus infestations that are too large for the Templars to handle.

     Leaving under escort with the CSS Fontenot, a hybrid 500 displacement ton exploratory ship, ingeniously combining a Serpent-class Scout ship & Gazelle Close Escort from the Covenant of Sufren, and the newly commissioned RCS Belladonna embarked from Aubaine Orbital at 0600hrs, without much fanfare or pomp. Indeed, the press was informed of its departure in time to watch then exit system into Jump space. Details from RCSA are sketchy, but it was released that a five being group, (or Sept) of Hivers, led by M.

Brusman Downport was electrified today by the news of the miraculous rescue from the planet Promise (####)/Promise/Diaspora, by the 400 dton Chronoraptor-class Free Trader Ship SS Bon Chance, (skippered by one CPT Branu Stigmann) of the crew of the MFU ship, RCS Mirablis-Victrix In another first, this marks CPT Stigmann's first ever journey to the RC worlds. He apparently was none too willing to talk to CIN, or have his picture taken. He remains sequestered with the eighteen survivors of the 26 men & women who crewed the MFU labeled RCS Mirablis -Victrix for de-briefing. What was released to the public, was an astonishing, chilling tale of a nightmarish world run by a Totalitarian Oligarchic Virus run regime of computer databases/ automated factories, and their Robot hordes, enslaving the estimated sixty to eighty million human inhabitants, and running a major starport (C-class) for the Vampire fleets traveling Coreward &Rimward thru the Promise-Khulam mains.<P>
CDR Saffron Ghulz was identified as the ranking man among the crew. RCS Mirablis -Victrix left Trybec Dawn Base nearly four months ago, ostensibly to survey the Pre-collapse mining facilities on Khirekhera /Khulam/Diaspora. Other parts of this fantastic story tell of disabling their captor ship's computer while in jump, and landing it on Promise, overpowering their robot captors on board.<P>
"I expect this will be the first mutiny that will go on RCN/RCES record without a court martial," CDR Ghulz said in a vid phone interview afterwards. "To be fair, all of we poor "Daves" pulled together to make it happen. Half of us died doing it. But we defeated a Vampire from inside itself. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need some rest."

CDR Saffron "Old Ghost"Ghulz, and several of the Promise Mission survivors were seen boarding the Free Trader SS Bon Chance & SS TeBiRoCaMon, and escorted out of system by the StarMerc ship, SMS Patuxuent, along with BG Cori Sterns & dozens of her Battle Angel troopers. Branu Stigmann, a known Wilds gunrunning captain & CPT Janvis Sunstar-Rourke, daughter of remnant survivor Professor Martin Francis Rourke, formerly of the University of Daibei, now at Aubaine, command the two merchanters.<P>
In light of the recent jailbreak, Security at Brusman down was unusually high, and while cameras were not barred, reporters were kept at a distance. While some planetary reporters were busy protesting this "unusual breach in the law level & Press freedom", wiser heads like CIN News anchor Gabriela Diabla noted these were almost all lancer vessels, and whatever the mission was, important enough to have an 800 dton Broadsword Merc cruiser for escort. RCSA spokesperson, Assemblyman Wilhelm Tanner from Oriflamme in a late evening interview following today's dramatic events at Anchordrift Detention barracks, denied Adair was aboard the Three ships that left, and mentioned while unfortunate, assured CIN, Adair was not aboard them.<P>
"Their mission," he allowed," is to go back & lift out resistance leaders from a key planet, that CDRE's Lathrop & Sayani (RCES CO/ RCN CNO) have detailed for a future Decapitation Strike. With the current level of hostilities emanating out of Shenk subsector from the Soleean Star Empire, we'll have to keep relying on Lancer forces. BG Stern's people are the best we've had, despite the more public bad apples like former CPT Adair." Assemblyman Tanner chairs on the SAG/DECAP committee. He refused to comment that the Target planet was indeed Promise itself along the "Vampire Highway" as the J-1 main running Coreward & Rimward thru Khulam to Promise Subsectors has been called.

The Newly rebuilt Atrase (Starport, Zalray-Down port, (A-rated) opened on schedule as the last of Schalli engineers cut loose her moorings. Zalray down is a completely submersible starport, a marvel of relic technology & Schalli ingenuity, utilizing Seawater for Refueling, and a Maglev shuttle system from the ship pads to the Central hub. It resembled, one observer reported, "Like a gigantic Hiver or Six-limbed Starfish upside down as she submerged off the Main Island." This was done for possible Raiding Vampires, to keep the planet looking primitive & the Starport hidden. EM Masking was installed on this massive structure for just such a purpose; the second of its kind. KeeEEaKaa Strongwall's facility off Brusman Down on Aubaine, is its bigger sister.<P>
	Atrase has seen massive construction but little ecological damage during this process. It is reported one of the four Pre-collapse SDB submerged bases was also refurbished, housing two Mint condition Jackal Class SDB's (cold recovered from Lote by JJFIS&M). Like wise, the townships of Zalray town & Mangus have grown as well. KeeEEaKaa Strong wall's SY, TrybecCorp, Dawn Construction, Delgado & Dushgin, General Products-LCC, and Transstar-LCC have  all contributed greatly to this achieve-ment. It is expected that some 2,000 Aubani-Schalli will remain here to be employed at the Starport, as well as some 1,000 RCN personnel for the SDB squadron, called "Die TeufelHunden". Much of the construction was paid for in the complete retrieval of the former Sternmetal Horizon-LCC High Tech energy research facility (TL-12) back to the Coalition,  (much of which went straight to Baldur) the rest paid for off planet investments from Fija, Trybec, Aubaine & Aurora. Oriflamman Assembly persons were noticeably absent, residing Corporate HQ for Sternmetal-LCC in the RC worlds, from the Celebratory ceremonies here on Fija.

	Battle weary but triumphant, the ships of JJFIS&M, Ltd.  made port today, carrying home the 2nd Bn (Mech) of the Battle Angels (Col Marissa Hamling, CO), with prizes. The news was electric though, despite the losses of RCS Tryffyd Slayer & the RMS Queensryche, their newest acquisition, the refitted Merchant-mercenary cruiser RCSNR Behemoth (formerly the SCNS Mercy), the Osprey, Green Hornet, the Sundowner-class Free Trader SS TeBiRoCaMon, and a 3 kiloton prize Gilgamesh-class Mercenary Assault ship, re-christened RCSNR Hephaestus docked today.<P>
	Despite overwhelming odds, against the more numerous forces of the Mystic dictatorship of Arch Vicar Avery Junor of Southmark, the Battle Angels, with close air support from the ships of JJFIS&M, defeated them on two fronts, with only one company each in the countries of Halflands & The Mark on the continent of Ursa Major in little more than six months.  On the continent of Ursa Minor, one company secured the TL-11 bootstrapping from Fija & Eos site in the timid, but industrial rich Country of Nordheim from the xenophobic terrorists Avery sent from the warring nation of Morland. The war Morland sought with the Coalition allied country of Freeland, with its island nation ally of Aguataine (who attempted to invade by sea while Morland struck thru the air & overland) was smashed in a single day by the Behemoth & Osprey working in concert, toppling both TED governments in the "Vezina-Bitzkrieg" textbook operational style.
	All of this progress was further complicated by the raiding forces of the Mercantile Guild, (who were intercepted by the RCES ships) attacking the TeBiRoCaMon in-system. In the space battle that followed, the Guild lost five ships, including the Mercenary Assault ship. It was in the boarding ops that the Queensryche crew was killed by the mercenaries from Hodg, that the Guild had hired, who over-powered the crew while the combined crews of the Behemoth & Osprey were boarding the Assault ship.<P>
	Among those killed were CPT Jehan "Rock head" Jablonski, of Baldur, and his entire crew. Names are being withheld, pending notification of next of kin. CPT Winona Yukowa and her crew on Tryffyd-Slayer managed to eject in their air raft before it lost its fusion mass. Overall, in the six-month mission the Battle Angels lost twenty-nine personnel, JJFIS&M lost 58. But Nova Rhyll's fractious governments have been united all, save two, and these have been marginalized & de-militarized (by force). Current status on the planet now is D-572734-8 B*702. As for the ever famous reputation of cold-recovery findings, part of the Air superiority & naval defeat of South Mark & Aguataine came from the discovery of an Pre-Collapse SDB base & 4x mint condition Jackal-class SDB's (two of which were shot down by SAMs during the war).<P>
	The D-port was built in Freeland, using the fusion power plant & fuel processors from a downed Morraine class Free Trader& the wreck of the Queensryche by JJFIS&M personnel, along with the already in place RCES bootstrap team from Fija. The locals built Freeland Downport' s Lhyd storage tanks.

It was noted by the Observant today at Brusman Downport of the arrival of the SS TEBIROCAMON, Captained by one Janvis Sunstar-Rourke, and the SMS Patuxuent, carrying BG Cori Sterns of the Battle Angels StarMerc Brigade. Last seen leaving here for the Promise subsector, ostensibly to rally the human led resistance vs. the Virus regime running the planet.
	CDR Ghulz was seen amongst those disembarking, but waiting shuttles took them immediately off to RCES /RCSA offices for closed debriefing. What has been released in he hours since this afternoon's hasty arrival from RCES INTEL Spokesperson, LTCDR Chelsea Bain, was this. "We have made contact with the Resistance & have several teams of cadre training those planetside on how best to use the arms & munitions sent to them. We are in discussions now with the leadership of said forces on how best to proceed."<P>

Due to repairs & annual maintenance, the firm of JJFIS&M, (Nike-Nimbus, Aubaine, Eos, & Nova Rhyll), is undertaking a Contact /Survey mission to Drydock (1211/Auva/Alpha Leonis), the nearest Pre-Collapse Naval Depot boneyard to the Coalition with RCSNR Behemoth. A Merchant to Military converted 3kton Hospital ship. Though a strategic Solomani Naval base during the war, it was never visited by disaster it is believed until the onset of AI Virus, in 1130. Green Hornet, Osprey, and Hephaestus are down for repairs & Jump drive re-alignments. Being an enlarged former SDB hull, Behemoth has been retrofitted with a large 900dton hold, and armed with 10x turrets(5) xxx3 SC/ (5) xxx3 150Mj LTs; 3x Msl Barbettes (15 ready msls), and 2x TL-15 Nuclear dampers, with MFDs for each battery. Behemoth has also had retrofitting for 2x CP-1000 Cargo pods.<P>
CPT Sean "Lucky-Dice" Egan, "Cyber-Dave" E. Jones, LTCDR Winona Yukowa, are among the officers leading this expedition, some 13 parsecs Rimward of Shenandoah. As per usual, RCES first contact  rules are in effect for any friendly stellar or pre-stellar worlds encountered along the way.<P>
The trip is expected to take 16 weeks at minimum, contacting the following worlds in Lazzerton Subsector:J-4 to Menaf, J-3 to Etienne,J-2 to Graff,J-2 to Umkarguu; beyond the current AO: J-3 to Merel(refuel only),J-3 to Cortez, J-2 to Hap; then into Auva subsector (J-3) to Janer, J-1 into Drydock(with J-2 spare fuel, incase of Vampires.). The return leg is posted as follows: into Mackenzie subsector, J-1 to Wabash, J-2 to Dixie, J-3 to Phaedrus, J-3 to Winona, J-3 to Patrent, J-2 to Shenandoah/Oriflamme subsector. "The first four we know are open to Free Traders, and appear  to RCES Scouts to be open to the Coalition's ambitious agenda," CPT Egan said in a late night Vid interview. "Astrographically, Etienne, Umkarguu, Cortez and Phaedrus all have no gas giants, so we hope they've survived fairly well thru Virus. The chances of a Vampire lurking in such systems have been proven smaller than those with gas giants along the mains."
When asked for who was sponsoring this mission, Egan was a bit evasive, citing "mission parameters didn't allow disclosure of who'd invested in the trip," but did allow that, "it had RCSA & RCES sanction, and aside from the obvious dangers of the Wilds, said, "if the salvage is anything close to 10% the trove its made out to be, I'll retire!" RCSNR Behemoth departs tomorrow morning.<P>
Victor von Hugo, Lucifer's wealthiest Entrepreneur, is reported to be one of JJFIS&M's sponsors on this mission, and his PR spokesperson, Adelia Wym denied today This had anything to do with following up on the Garvey Society's exodus in SS Minnow last month. What was allowed was, many that Hostilities with Solee are going to require a lot more machinery for the Coalition's shipyards part in it, and though the word "War" has been avoided, some see it as inevitable.

<P><hR><P>COALINFONET EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH REMNANT ADVISOR PROFESSOR MARTIN FRANCIS ROURKE, 24/VII/1202, AUBAINE/AUBAINE, <B>KEYWORDS: RCES INTEL, COVERT OPS, CENTRISM, FEDERALISM, KULIGAAN, ARRIVAL VENGEANCE, DOMAIN OF DENEB, SURVIVING VIRUS.
</B><BR>reported by <A  HREF="../../credits.html#Devlin">Liam Devlin</A><P>
Prof. Martin Francis Rourke graciously allowed this interview with CIN, and from our sources, is currently employed at the University of Aubaine, not the Hiver technical Institute, as was previously thought. A remnant of the former Imperium, from Daibei Sector, Prof Rourke taught at the Dept of History on Warinir, and his survival & his two daughters during the Long Night has made him something of a celebrity, a point he has assiduously denied, like rival Professor Ililek Kuligaan, who has denounced him publicly as an apologist for the Final War & all its excesses.
	Professor Rourke was a prisoner with his daughters on board their Vampire vessel until rescued by the Free Trader vessel TeBiRoCaMon, a Solomani Sundowner Far Trader in 1190 in Massilia Sector.  A soft-spoken man of intense blue eyes, black hair slowly going silver, with an Irish accent, this is his first private interview since arriving in Coalition Space.
<P>
<B>Rourke:</B> Where do ye wish to begin? About me, well, I was born Jump one from Regina in the Spinward Marches on the low gravity world of Hefry. It's sort of like Lucifer, in a way. Line -marriages are the order for survival there, since the colonization. I had three mothers, and four fathers, and about a dozen Siblings. As a younger man, I served in the Imperial Interstellar Scout Service, saw action in the Fifth Frontier war vs. the Zhodani, was seriously wounded, and was discharged. I immigrated Rimward in 1108 to Warinir after finishing my schooling, and won a prestigious posting there at the Daibei Sector University of Warinir. It's a water world, not unlike like Aubaine. It was there I met the crew of the ISS Arrival Vengeance & Professor Ililek Kuligaan. And the women I was to marry, among the crew, Ms Megan Janvis, and Nova Astrid. As I said, we practice line-marriage where I come from.
<P>
<B>CIN:</B> This was the legendary mission sent from the Domain of Deneb to try and halt the Final war or put the "Humpty-Dumpty" Imperium back together again; those were your words, right?
<P>
<B>Rourke:</B> (Laughs, not unkindly)	A true as quote as ever given. Let me put it in modern terms for ye. 'Seems Archduke Norris sent this bunch of Lancers out to see what after eight years of the Civil war could be done to try & bring the Imperium' s faction fraught war to an end. Politically speakin', it was a dangerous move for him, beset by Vargr, the Aslan and the Zhodani, as well as a risin' tide of xenophobia socially speakin'.
 I was a member of Academia then, like Kuligaan, who was traveling Known space in his war of words against the war and the senseless slaughter going on.  And for the record, I categorically agree with him there. It WAS senseless slaughter. Nothing can excuse it let us all remember that. I saw first hand, along with the crew of the Vengeance the horrors and insanity of the war on the two-year leg back to Deneb.
<P>
<B>CIN:</B> 	Professor Kuligaan called you and your daughter's Odyssey across the Wilds, "a fortunate but fraught with fancy tale". He calls your time amongst the Free Traders and polity of Sufren as some of the worst examples of "Imperialism" since the advent of Virus. And that you're being hired by RCES INTEL as a remnant "advisor", as well as Free Trader diplomat is, "damning the Coalition to repeat those mistakes". He calls your reverence for the Domain of Deneb, and its version of the Imperium "part of the last era's sickness."
<P>
                              <B>Rourke:</B>	(smiles crookedly) "Let me put it in professional terms, speaking of the good Professor. He and I have more in common than most folks know which is a good thing. Sad in other ways, like his animosity towards me, and my daughters. I suggest we (he and I) not "air our dirty laundry" out in the open. I'm a gentleman, and I don't attack folk's family. I'll debate till the cows come home with even the most backward minded fool ye care to have across from me, but the things he said against me daughters are unforgivable. Th' things he said against me, well, I'm as an old a codger as he is, and I can take it.
		In my defense of our story, tis true, the Vampire that infected our ship in Gushmege Sector in 1129 killed my wives Megan & Nova, tried to kill me, and kept me as a hostage in low berth over my two daughters and the rest of the crew. Why it didn't kill them, I haven't a clue. They grew up, raised by it, and eventually the crew was replaced along its travels. I was revived in 1190, and found out what kind of women my daughters had become, when it was finally salvaged by the all-female crew of the TeBiRoCaMon, operating in the wilds near the Covenant of Sufren.
		In defense of bein' a diplomat, or speaker for the Free traders of Diaspora, on that I can vouch. There bein' tradition on the ship of all female crewmembers, Aslan, Vilani, Solomani, Ayanshi, Scanian, even a Vargr, I was relegated to bein' a permanent passenger. I have met almost all of the "Big Ten" family run ships. Thanks to the Mercantile Guild and Virus, there are now only five of the latter, as well as host of smaller ship's captains who had the gumption to resist the Guild and move away from their tentacles of Monopoly. I'd reserve judgment on the Covenant of Sufren till the RCS Belladonna returns, meself. Jumpin to conclusions, while convenient for Herr Kuligaan, is unprofessional for a man of his education.<P>
 	In the Federation of Daibei, run by Good Duke Craig, probably outside of what went on behind the Claw, the most honorable upright leader in the Rebellion. He denied Lucan his fleets, as well as Dulinor, the assassin. Up to his ears in Raiders out of The Deep (Reaver's Deep sector), Aslan Ihatei fleets, and the Spinward arm of the Solomani Confederation 's invasion fleets, Craig defended his people, "The people are the Imperium" was his motto, from aggression, and had to secede from Lucan's Imperium to prevent being left defenseless from an uncaring selfish "Emperor" Lucan. Archduke Norris did likewise, cut off as he was, behind the Claw (The Great Reft). Like some of these folks who survived Virus have had to take extreme measures, so did these two great men.
	As for the charge of "being part of the sickness of the former Imperium", I'm sure to be sure, Herr Kuligaan has his reactionary-hysterical-extremist adherents in those young people this Reformed Coalition is hurling out into the Wilds with that we need a "kinder, gentler New Star faring World Order". I know I will never convince them, so I will not bother to try.  I'm sure he's referring to my part in the Intelligence services of Federation of Daibei, with whom I was associated. Unlike Herr Kuligaan, I never worked for a monster, like Dulinor. And I won't be run out of town on a rail like Mr. Eugene Enligi & the Garvey Society folks. Sorry Old stick, it ain't happenin'."
<P>
<B>CIN:</B>	So you believe in these leaders who thought of the people first, as the lifeblood of the former Imperium as good men. Is it possible that the Spinward Marches survived at all? It is not very well known then that Professor Kuligaan worked for the Black Duke, Dulinor?  He left his service and lived a life on the run from Ilelish assassins throughout the War, which he spent condemning.

<P>
<B>Rourke:</B>	"To answer your first question, I know for a fact The Domain of Deneb has survived behind the Claw, since I was sent from there to warn what was left of Strephon's Stronghold of the advent of Virus. Contrary to popular belief, the spread wasn't due so much to the X-boat network, that had already long since collapsed in the vast gulfs of the Outlands and Wilds of Gushmege, Daguudashaag, Zarushaagar, Lishun, Massilia & Diaspora Sectors during the "Hard Times" (1124-1129), as it did from what was left of Lucan's four fleets & Dulinor's "Coronation Fleet". The X-boat web did affect the Domains of Dulinor, Margaret, Lucan, Antares, the Solomani Confederation, the Aslani Hierate, the Hivers, the Vargr Extants, as we have seen, where Technology was still at Pre-war levels.
Though your "friends" the Hivers tell us the K'Kree were probably leveled by Virus as well, they will also recover, being used to low automation as well.  I'm not so sure they will look kindly on humaniti for releasing Virus, though they will view the ability to acquire new worlds without as many carnivores in the way as a gift horse, pardon the pun.
As for the Imperial's beyond the Claw? One day, they will return, like the Arrival Vengeance did. What will that day entail? Proof I was right about them, and Herr Kuligaan was wrong. Until then, I intend to aide this Reformed Coalition's efforts in re-claiming the stars, with my knowledge of the Guild, which has three times tried to kill my daughters and me."
<P>
<B>CIN:</B>	And the second question, sir?  About Mr. Kuligaan. He is the most famous remnant recovered to date; he must have had his reasons for leaving Dulinor. You can't be labeling him as he's labeled you? Isn't what he's saying true?
<P>
<B>Rourke:</B> 	(smiles grimly) "Can't I? Is it slanderous? True, his official position was the prestigious Head of the Astrid Ilethian Chair of History, on Dlan. This was however, but a front for Dulinor's Intelligence Secret Service, of which Kuligaan was the Kingpin, answerable only to Dulinor & his Admirals. I cannot answer for His beliefs he once held. He can answer that better than I. Playing the Devil's Advocate for a moment; it is to his credit he left the monster he served. I'm defending myself in the arena of ideas & ideals.
<P>
Like Him, I was a History Professor, and a Spy. And to be fair, I've killed a few people in my time, some barehanded. I won't say it was "Just following orders". I won't get into moral platitudes of which was better, killing armed opponents intent on harming others, like SolSec commandoes or Lucan's Minions who attempted to kill Duke Craig in 1126, as opposed to having been silent while one's leader he advised killed an unarmed man, woman and young lady in front of the Whole Imperium. I'll let your readers & viewers do that.
Besides, he's all but called me a liar. Ask him yourself. He knew too much, when he left Dlan--of course Dulinor wanted him dead. He knew the Black Duke's plans to kill Emperor Strephon, his wife & daughter, and plunge the Imperium down the road it went. I was under orders to keep an eye on him in Daibei.   When he went rabble-rousing in the Federation, it was deemed he might be a liability.  I had him my sights, but it was deemed he might be a better weapon alive against the madness if he lived. Or so I argued to my leadership. Happy for us all, they saw my point. If he feels betrayed by my being here, then I feel the personage of this sacred cow he has become needs closer examination. He above all should remember the Historian's axiom, "These are the Lies we've agreed to tell". I'm not a revisionist, or a defender of the excesses and wrongs done in the previous era, but neither am I an accomplice to the mass murder of billions in a war I started.  I'm a proud father, and a citizen of Humanity in a galaxy gone mad. And no curmudgeon of his ilk is going to war upon me with words unanswered! This is my response. Next topic please."
<P>
<B>CIN:</B>  	How do you feel about politics, the case of Federalism, versus Centrism on the issues facing us today? Like the Soleean Empire opposing our efforts in Thoezennt & Shenk subsectors, and the menace of the Vampire Highway?
<P>
<B>Rourke:</B>	First off, I dinnae do Politics. Never appealed to me. Never will. I do know that if one is opposed to the threat that toppled the largest human Interstellar society one must take active measures. In me humble opinion, Vampires, Solee, and the Mercantile Star farer's Guild threaten the Coalition today from without.  I don't put 'em in that order meself, but strategically, they are. From within, the selfishness that makes we humans what we are is a large threat, Planets, and systems looking out for their own best interests, not being a complete part of the team. That's why the RCN needs to be a viable force. If one is to build a new society, one will be prudent to be able to defend it. As Plato said in the ancient Athenian papers, "First in all things this above else, go armed."<P>
	And while we have things like the Trigger Incident of Montezuma & the Operation Cosmic Fire of Daaliisa fiascoes poisoning future operations spinward in Diaspora to look at, we have idealism meeting reality head on. I've spoken with many who were fired up at the beginning, and are disillusioned at best now.  Lets face facts, the Coalition's Intelligence services agents from various planets are not working in concert, but in what Herr Kuligaan calls the Imperial factionalism.  Bad Intel equates to bad results. Poor leadership, no matter the enthusiasm & vigor, will burn out. Taking matters into one's own hands was seen in both cases. No cohesion in this great effort is bad. A total all out Federalist policy is almost as bad as the total all out Isolationism the extreme Centrist wing of the RCSA advocates. Like those of Fija, I believe a plan is what's needed, as well as goals. True, a lot of what has happened already is by chance in some way, but I believe we are the masters of our destinies, not the Hivers. In this we oppose the Guild, who seeks to monopolize Free Trade & opposes all stellar polities. They want to keep the power they have, and keep the Universe balkanized & xenophobic.<P>
	Shocking but true. The Hivers, our allies, ostensibly they want a friendlier Human Stellar polity in the future than the Imperium, who can blame them? Some of those who oppose the Light of the New Era will die. It cannot be helped. What we can control is how many we kill. All sophont life is precious, be it Hiver, Humaniti, Aslani, Vargr, Vegan, what have you.  We have to find a balance between the extremes of Federalism & Centrism. The RC isn't there yet, in me humble opinion."<P>
	'As for Solee, they are an aberration of a previous era. We oppose what they support, a return to Margaret's Domain type of polity. We must, and shall overcome them. But to weigh them in the balance versus Virus, they are second in the standings by comparison. I am not so well acquainted as of yet with the local talent in the diplomatic staffing of the Coalition to make a determination of can we see our way thru this dilemma without an outright war, but I must concur with SG Maggart, we can ill afford to be caught unawares.

Since the RCNS Nightwatcher docked in port yesterday, rumors have started to fly about an unspecified incident in the Wilds. Today RCES officials at Dawn Base announced that the RCNS Nightwatcher had discovered a raider attack on the planet Nicosia(0138-X-56666D-3) Aubaine/Old Expanses. The Nightwatcher arrived several days after the attack as part of a RC diplomatic effort to improve relations with the planet. According to eyewitnesses a large ship (probably from 500-1500 displacement tons) landed on the Botany Bay, The Nation of New Burn's primary Port, and discharged 50-100 human raiders and a dozen or so robots. The raiding force was heavily armed with a variety of weapons, but did not seem to be a military organization. The robots were of unidentified types, but seemed to be independent entities. The raiders moved through the city attacking any resident they saw. They also looted and burned many of the settlement's buildings. The raiders continued their rampage for several days before departing. Several of the nearby farms were also attacked. The raiders took with them a few dozen captives, and a large quantity of goods.
In their wake the most of Botany Bay was burned to the ground and many of its citizens were killed. An undisclosed, but high number of the corpses showed evidence of torture and mutilation. Many of the women were raped and beaten, before being killed. Of the town's 25,000 known residents only 12,700 have been found alive. The capital of New Burn, Perth, has sent in several battalions of aid troops & aide workers to assist the survivors, most of who are in a state of shock. This orgy of slayings left even hardened local veterans of the wars with the Empire of Australia sickened. Nothing like this has been seen since the Final War. <P>
New Burn is a small nation on the Southern continent of Australis, lying west of the TED run New Australian Empire. The port settlement was home to some light manufacturing, mostly cottage industries, shipbuilding, and fishing. 25,000 people lived in port, while roughly another 15, 000 lived in small farms around the city. The farms raised crops and livestock. The Nightwatcher was dropping of this party when it found out about the attack. The Ambassador and her staff have stayed planetside to provide assistance, against the wishes of the Captain, RCN CPT John "Full House" Roger. Since the attack, The New Australian Empire has made overtures to the remaining Botany Bay folk for them to come under the banner of the Empire, whose border lies 650 km to the east. Some have accepted, while others are thinking the offer over. Both cities are very afraid of what has happened, and this incident has only increased their paranoia about outsiders.
	The New Australian Empire is a known Star farer's Mercantile Guild client state, and has been purchasing "Crunch-guns" from them to snipe at SAG teams into the old Starport ruins in their territory. New Burn (CO govt/pop 0.35 million/avg TL-3m/L-H-L-M-H) was one of two nations with whom RCES had opened negotiations with thru the Republic of Maldaar, a nation friendly to off world trade & contact(RD govt/ pop 0.45 million/avg TL-4/H-H-M-L-L).  Borea being the other( CO govt/ pop 0.3million/avg TL-3h/ L-H-M-L-L).

LTCDR Horace "Tea-Time" Titan, of RCN Teufelhunden Sqdn AJ001&AJ002, a pair Jackal-class System defense boats assigned to the Atrase World system, confirmed claims by the out system bound squadron of Registered Mercenary ships (RMS) Bloodhound, Relentless & Mjolnir of the Lancer group known as The Templars had indeed uncovered, and attacked the "Ripper-gang" of the raider vessels responsible for the Starhelm Prison jailbreak in the Kruyter System, the Massacre of Botany Bay on Nicosia several weeks ago, and it seems, Virally hijacked the Luhtalan ship LNS Space Witch, freeing the "Shackleton Slasher", serial murderer Dr Manfred Strauss. "Both the RMS Relentless and RMS Bloodhound were heavily damaged by the larger Vampire ship they identified as an ex-Imperial Mosquito-class Fleet Escort, " LTCDR Titan reported.  "We found the remains of the LNS Space Witch, right where they claimed they left them, orbiting an abandoned LSP-LCC in system Lhyd fuel refining station on the first moon of Atrase's 4th largest gas giant, Moonshae. Demolition charges were applied to the EMM converted Stellar liner's computer systems. The bridge & engine room are inoperable. That crate won't be leaving there without help." As for the Rippers, as these murderous thugs have been labeled in the press, LTCDR Titan reports upon "finding their former TL-8 modular quarters had been stormed, and every thug there had been shot at close quarters, probably with Accelerator rifles, judging from the carnage. Stupid killers never should bring shivs to a gunfight. Pretty one sided, it seemed to me, " Titan said laconically. "The Templars said they'd rescued some of the victims seized from Nicosia, but hadn't had room for the scum." CIN noted a lack of sympathy for the ambushed killers, many of who apparently were Starhelm's worst offenders. About forty-two rippers were slain in the assault. The Templars reported on sprained ankle on their side, CIN learned.<P>
LTCDR Titan concluded, "that while the assault was ensuing, the larger ship of the pair returned, and the Templar spacers engaged it, scoring several hits, before driving it off. They estimated they had done serious damage to its M-drives, but not enough to keep it from leaving system." More alarming news though, was the nuclear device left to destroy the Ripper's base. After confirming their "kill", The Templar's allowed the RCN crewed SDB time to clear off. The device was detonated by maser link from the Jump point off Moonshae.<P>
LTCDR Titan was formally reprimanded by RCN CDRE Sayani for Dereliction of duty, failure to apprehend the Mercenaries for questioning & unlawful possession of nuclear weapons". The deadpan Oriflamman skipper's reply was to shrug. "Number one, This wasn't inside the Coalition. Number two, I don't disarm nuclear devices, and I'm not a certified Ordinance disposal guy! And three, I figure they just saved the RCSA Courts a lot of time & paperwork. 'Sides, they had it coming to them."

Well-informed circles announce troop shifting to Fija and Aurora. Ten Oriflamman (TL-9/10) and three Auroran (TL-12) divisions have orders to Aurora. Special operation teams of the RCN and the RCES practice small group combat missions on Atrase and Buhle. <P>
	CDRE Sean "Hammer" Lathrop of RCES & CDRE J .N. Sayanni, were in closed briefings with starship captains of the gathering RCN & RCES & Star Merc forces of BG Cori Sterns. Word has leaked, that the Coalition will be putting forth its largest Decapitation operation to Date. Spokesperson for the Navy, LTCDR Ibrihim Humbria, stated briefly to the press, " We're going to break the back of the Promise subsector Vampire Network, plain and simple, once and for all."
 In Orbit were noted both Class IV Maggart class Clippers, RCNS Maggart & RCNS Karlsruhe, The Fijian "Grey Ghost" Fighter Squadron (comprised of three dozen TL-15 Rampart light Ftrs), the Class III Aurora Clippers, RCNS Thunderchild, RCNS Firelord, RCNS Argent, RCNS Balder & RCNS Ra, each equipped with 3x Battle Riding Manticore class LBRs.  Also making their debut were the 6 kton Frigates RCNS Fusilier, & RCNS Rifleman, (N-PAW armed) with a 1000 dton Oases fueler(carried), and the 6 kton Frigates RCNS Lancer, RCNS Hussar(Meson armed) also equipped with a 1000 dton Oases fueler.  Three of the RCN's six Pathfinder Scouts have been tasked to this effort as well.<P>
Neither of the surviving Class II Aurora clippers (RCNS Apollo, RCNS Aube), were seen in evidence. Sources close to the RCN-RCES commanders revealed these are re-assigned to the ongoing Coreward RC Navy efforts versus Solee, along with the (Class III) RCNS Immanuel Kant, RCNS Helios & their Manticore LBR squadrons.  By comparison to the larger ships, only four Victrix class sloops, RCS Norfolk-Victrix, Schalli-Victrix, Balduri-Victrix, and Eos-Victrix were detailed to this armada, as the bulk of these too, have been assigned to the Shenk-Thoezennt front lines, as have the remaining four Frigates & their fuelers.<P>
Fija's own transport & freight based Transstar, LCC has re-assigned it's three newly refitted 1kton BUFF class freighters, TSS Mothra, and TSS Rodan to the effort for support, under the emergency War Powers act voluntarily.

After five days of arguing who owned what, and for how long, the Balduri & Oriflamman representatives, tired of bickering & accusations, stood long enough to muster votes in the Assembly to include the boneyard worlds of Seliga (Aubaine/0610, X532000-0), Conner (Aubaine/ 0810, X310000-0), Bestor* (Oriflamme /0301, D-110217-9), Corrig* (Oriflamme/ 0501 D-622217-9), Sarid* (Oriflamme/0702, C-000517-A), and L'Steich* (Oriflamme/0503 C-9A4417-A) into the Coalition by annexation. The motion was tabled for a vote for next month by barest of margins. Federalist assemblypersons were astounded at the heat & vehemence the Oriflamman delegates displayed over discovering Baldur had pulled these off under their (Oriflamme's) noses.   A walk out by the Oriflamman delegates was narrowly avoided when the Balduri mysteriously threatened to sponsor the RC client state of Kal (Oriflamme [1339] /Old Expanses (D-778452-7) into the Coalition.
	In the heat of the debate & subsequent vote, The newly formed corporation of Jumping Jack Flash Interstellar & Mercantile, Ltd of Aubaine & Nike-Nimbus, laid claim to Seliga, while Transstar, promising to aide in shipping recovered goods back to Auction, put its cards on the table as well. HTTC, formerly from L'Steich itself, as are most from Baldur, has been quietly building the bridge to Trailing in the Coreward corner of the Oriflamme Subsector. Apparently with Oriflamman support to the colonization efforts in the So Skire Main on Poyzen (So Skire 1736/Old Expanses/(C-787533-8) & the bootstrapping of So Skire/(So Skire 1732/ Old Expanses/ (D-667834-4*). That they had made interstellar refueling way stations (like Adrian) out of Corrig & Bestor came as much of a surprise to some of the Federalists in the assembly as it did the Centrist faction.<P>
	Balduri Spokesperson, Koenig Pangoulis looked deadpan as usual stating, "that to secure a J-2 route to the now breadbasket, (Poyzen) for his planet, these boneyards to Trailing were easier to set up than the initial Colony itself". And as for the move being "federalist", " he averred, "A secure infrastructure comes with such acquisitions, as we have always voted for. Naturally, these (worlds) are open to the rest of the Coalition for refueling. " To the Oriflamman protests over the massive "colony" at Sarid, Koenig shrugged. "Bourgund Yards stand to profit from the Ores & radioactives we are continuing to mine & refine out there. Jealousy of our initiative with the AV weapon "Snake" has no place in this Political arena."<P>
.  "In retrospect," an unnamed source in the Assembly commented wryly," I hadn't had so much fun watching a bunch of Technarchs choke on their own greed, since I don't know when! And of all people to sell Oriflamme "under the Table", but their staunch ally, Baldur!" Oriflamman delegates would not comment to this reporter.

Triumphant & jubilant was the mood of the crew of the RCSNR Behemoth, and due for a rest as they assigned their ship to the Yards for annual maintenance. In seventeen weeks, they had crossed through three subsectors, contacting the worlds of Lazzerton subsector: Menaf, (C-class Starport, Population 5, TL-8) Etienne, (B-class Starport, Population 4, TL-11) Graff, (D-class Starport, Population 7, TL-8), Umkarguu;( C-class Starport, Population 8, TL-10), Cortez, (B-class Starport, Population 6, TL-11), into Auva subsector to Janer, (D-class starport, Population 7, TL-8), J-1 into Drydock where their mission to salvage TL-13, & 14, J-4 & J-5 engine building machinery was successful, despite run ins with small Vampire ships. <P>
The return leg went into Mackenzie subsector, first to Wabash, (D-Starport, population 5, TL-8) then to Dixie, a Free trader's world (C-class starport, Population 3, TL-9) to Phaedrus, (B-class Starport, Population 6, TL-11, with an intact former Imperial Naval base). "These eight worlds are open to Free Traders, and wish to join the Reformation Coalition," CPT Egan said in a late night Vid interview. "Astrographically, Etienne, Umkarguu, Cortez and Phaedrus all have no gas giants, they've survived fairly well thru Virus." <P>
	CPT Egan reported that Phaedrus is allied with two other nearby planets, New Paris (C-class starport, Population 7, TL-8) and Seward (E-class port, Population 6, TL-7) in a mini-polity The Confederation of Phaedrus. New Paris & Phaedrus together share a joint cemetery world, Pickwick, that lies between them. The Phaedran's told them of another polity with whom they'd had cordial relations thus far, three parsecs beyond New Paris, lying across Subsector C & Mackenzie (B), close to the Rimward edge of the huge Sitah Main. At Colfax, (D-class Starport, Population 2, TL-9, relic Imperial Scout base), he reports," the cordially mixed descendants of the former Imperial Interstellar Scout service base crew and the survivors of a crippled Solomani Cruiser who crash-landed here in 1131. This was the outermost outpost of the Clarke's Realm Federal Republic. Formal contact was arranged for a future mission. This Polity's central planet is Clarke's Realm, which renamed itself from its pre-collapse name of Yellowknife.
	From the openness of the "Sol-Scouts", as the inhabitants called themselves, they said Clarke's Realm has a Population of 8, a Pre-war Imperial Naval base, a B-class Starport, and a sustainable TL-11 society. Like Phaedrus, it possesses no Gas Giants. It has re-opened Asteroid mining in Waypoint & Harmony's Belt systems, one parsec to trailing each from itself (D- starports, Population 4, TL-11 each). Through its main, it has opened with Hartford, (C-class port, population 7, TL-10), three cemetery worlds to recover TL-10 & 11 artifacts.<P>
	Luhtahlan Assemblyman, and multibillionaire, Victor Von Hugo announced proudly that ", the survey & contact mission was financed thru his corporation BTG Salvage, LCC & the Shenandoan firm, Rimward Relic Recovery Retrofitters, Ltd., Karlshafen /Shenandoah. "The success of this venture has borne us new friends to our Rimward facing in this Universe. On behalf of their worlds we have hosted on Lucifer & Shenandoah during this mission, we the representatives of Lucifer & Shenandoah, sponsor the Confederation of Phaedrus, and the Free worlds of Lazzerton subsector as Associate members of the RC."<P>
	Senior Oriflamman Delegate, Jason Bigalow practically had a conniption fit upon hearing the eccentric Luhtahlan proposal. "This is sheer folly to inundate this many worlds at once into the Coalition's infrastructure! Assemblyman Von Hugo has seriously overstepped his bounds this time! The people of Lucifer should have a vote of no-confidence in this Lunatic's lunacy!"  <P>
Comments from Lucifer's other two Assemblypersons, Hadrian Balboa & Benson, were equally enthusiastic, as was the single representative for Shenandoah in contrast.  "In the words of Dr Kuligaan, CARPE DIEM!" said Shenandoah's world Rep. Helayna Carson. "The 'Flammer's can't stand it that we draw more worlds with honey than drop-ships! Even Baldur's beating them at it! (Referring to the steady quiet expansion into their former territories trailing in the Oriflamme subsector by HTTC) Whoo hoo!"  <P>
Both worlds stand much to gain as gateways to this new frontier in trade into Coalition Space. And expansionist-minded corporations, like BTG Salvage, LCC. , JJFIS&M, LTD. and Rimward Relic Recovery Retrofitters, Ltd are sure to bring new life to the old salvager's trade, and lend it some respectability for this often dangerous, but lucrative work.
	When asked about the recent windfall in fortunes the following day, CPT Sean "Lucky-Dice" Egan grinned, fired up an expensive cigar and announced he was, "running for the Assembly Seat," being vacated by his father Micheal Connor Egan, "due to health related causes," next month in a special election run-off. "I think the Assembly needs someone who's been "out in the Wilds" for a change, and I said I'd retire. By the way, Ms [Winona] Yukowa and I are getting married next week, ya'll are invited!"  Shares in JJFIS&M, LTD traded +151 pts higher the day after the RCSNR Behemoth hit the yards; with the Starship jump drive machinery brought back at auction.

The Assembly voted today on the formal annexation of six boneyards into the Coalition: Seliga (Aubaine/0610, D-533310-A), Conner (Aubaine/0810, E-310112-8), Bestor (Oriflamme/0301/ D-110217-9), Corrig (Oriflamme/0501/ D-622217-9), Sarid (Oriflamme/0702, C-000565-A), and L'Steich (Oriflamme/0503/ C-9A4465-B). The Assembly approved the annexation of all of these planets, with far less contention than last month's stormy session.
These worlds will be administered territories of the Coalition. Navigational beacons are already in place, according to HTTC of Baldur (Bestor, Corrig, Sarid, L'Steich). Jumping-Jack-Flash Interstellar Trade & Mercantile, Ltd. has yet to purchase any or emplace them. The Assembly gave them three months to have them installed at Seliga & Conner, or forfeit their claim.

In a speech delivered early this morning Secretary General Lon Maggart spoke bluntly about the increasing tensions in Shenk subsector as a result of the Soleean Crisis and of a number of steps the RC would be implementing at home to ensure a swift resolution. Though his words were vague about the actual dangers posed by Solee, the seriousness with which the Assembly views the situation was best exemplified with the SG's own words.
"With the continued deterioration of the Solee situation we are left with little choice but to commit a greater percentage of our forces to maintain that frontier, furthermore as the possibility of hostilities continue to increase with every moment it has been decided that there will be an immediate review of Oriflamme's, Bourgund Shipyards, Trybec's, Dawn Construction Yards, and Kruyter's, Kruyter Corps Deep Space Yards B-ratings in the hopes that they can be upgraded to A- classifications at sometime in the immediate future. In addition to this, The C-class Starports of Baldur, Nike Nimbus, Eos, L'Steich, And, Sarid will be upgraded to B-status as soon as possible.  To this end no effort will be spared to assure the material and technical expertise are available to allow for this classification change to occur in a timely fashion. As such all materials recovered from the Wilds relating to the construction, repair and maintenance of starships and their components shall be considered eminent domain of these shipyards and shall only be distributed to other shipyards should those materials be superfluous." <P>
For sometime technical crews from the Bourgund Shipyards and Dawn Construction Yards have traveled to Aubaine to acquire the necessary information and skills to allow for the eventual upgrading of these facilities. In the wake of this morning's announcement by the SG it was decided during an emergency Assembly vote that technical experts from Aubaine would instead journey to the shipyards at Oriflamme, Trybec, and Kruyter to oversee and assist with their transformation into A-class facilities. <P>
It is expected that by sometime early tomorrow morning the first Aubani technical crew, consisting of some twenty-five individuals, will depart for Oriflamme aboard the freshly returned RCS Fairfax, additional crews will depart as necessary. The first crews headed for Trybec & Kruyter are scheduled for departure sometime later this week.

RCSA is pleased to announce the opening of diplomatic relations with the planets Schotz (1937/ C-546776-5, S, T, Ag / Janazzo (1838/B-345643-8, Ag Ni), Cobham (1835 /C-79A7B8-9, Wa) & Barlow (1934/D-687575-7, T, Ag Ni/So Skire/Old Expanses) Though Schotz remains very reclusive and restricts foreign contact, the Hive Federation has been allowed to establish a Temporary Base in the outer system, that will enable the refueling of ships and provide a firm Jump 3 link connecting the Reformation Coalition and the Hiver client-state in Sitah subsector (Subsector P/Old Expanses).
Travel to Schotz, and use of it's class C starport will be restricted until negotiations can be completed, though the use of the Hiver Temp Base (and all such bases on the Jump 3 link) has been extended to all Coalition vessels, as well as independent merchants. Some Assembly representatives have expressed concern over the reclusive nature of the world and it's government. RCES confirms that a Technologically Elevated Dictatorship does not rule the world, just extremely high levels of xenophobia. <P>
Travel to Janazzo,  & Cobham by contrast, is open to Coalition Traders (large & small firms). Janazzo supports a huge former TL-12 B-class orbital star port, renovated with TL-8 during the Hard Times, and maintained throughout the "Short-Night".  Of the 8 million sophonts, 30% are Droyne. Janazzo's Starport is a linchpin of trade & repairs for Free Traders here in the So Skire Main, running into the Hinter Lands Sector, as well as Rimward into Dagir Subsector(C) of Alpha Leonis Sector. The system exports repaired relic technology, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and processed ores from its inner & outer belts. They are governed by an efficient friendly business oriented Charismatic Oligarchy. Curiously, they are content with their current Non-aligned status, and current Tech level.<P>
Cobham is the highest tech Freeport in the main, (TL-9), boasting a large C-class port, also in orbit, and recently with Trade expansion has moved itself back from TL-8 to TL-9, with the Balduri Colony of Poyzen (1736/D-787564-8, Ag Ri). Some 70 millions dwell there, ruled by an impersonal Bureaucracy. They also are J-1 from the colony and the relationship seems cordial. Cobham has applied for Client State status with the RC, seeing the benefits of uplifting firsthand on Poyzen.
The planet Barlow is another Hiver Staging area, for their J-4 route from Clarke, (across the So Skire Gulf.

The Hive Federation Ambassador, to the Reformation Coalition, M. Sherman, announced that, in conjunction with approval by an Assembly subcommittee, that the Hive Federation is establishing a permanent J3 trade route connecting the Reformation Coalition with what has become known as the Sitah "stepping stone" connecting the Reformation Coalition with the Hiver Federation. Not truly organized on an interstellar level, the subsector has benefited from Hiver technology and uplift efforts and the worlds of region trade amongst themselves.  These worlds are led by the Hi pop world of RENJ (pop A, 80 billion people!), formerly known as SYRIM. Other worlds colonized by them & the Hiver Federation include Zolibe, Dahlgren, Delphinium, Mackloud, Zoquet, Quell, Jowaa, & Adam, with the allied worlds of Darinov, Casseiopea, Osmosis, Markham, Miisha, Carmen, only two systems remain classified as Wilds, at Kodants & Surren. The rest are boneyard worlds.
The Sitah subsector (Subsector P of Old Expanses Sector) has long experienced Hiver efforts (early 1180's) and is the site for many so called Hiver "Temporary" Bases. Hiver J3 merchant ships have previously visited the Reformation in semi-regular convoys, under protection of ships of the Federation Navy. In an effort to encourage participation on the trade route by the Reformation Coalition, the Federation Ambassador announced that the Hive Federation would subsidize Jump 3 merchant designs by Aubaine's Standard Astrotronics and KeeEEka Strongwall Shipyards. A junior Oriflammen Assembly representative has derided the offer as being "useless to Oriflamme" and "another manipulation to keep Aubaine in ascendance in their Client State."

A bill has just been introduced that would fund and authorize contact and diplomacy missions into So Skire Subsector that would facilitate official relations with the Reformation Coalition and facilitate official Reformation Coalition endorsement of the Hive Federation's recently established J3 trade route connecting the Reformation Coalition with the Sitah (Subsector P/Old Expanses) region & Republic Of RENJ (B-86AA98-B, N, Hi In Wa / Sitah/Old Expanses). Initial commentary has been very muted, but it is expected that Oriflammen representatives will oppose the measure, as they have a number of operations ongoing in the "Back Face" of the Coalition, that could be endangered by official Coalition activity. Other Centrist and Pro-Consolidation representatives are expected to favor the measure, and Federalist sentiments are divided. Many Aubani representatives wish to see the Oriflammen "conquest" of the Back Face thwarted, but are dubious in encouraging the increasing power of the Coalition's central government, particularly in issues of interstellar trade. Other debate has circulated around revising the Primary Area of Operations to allow full operations in this and other subsectors, but the issue is expected to be blocked by both Centrist and Federalist leadership, who are protecting the compromise agreed upon with the founding of the Coalition.

In a sweeping vote today, the RCSA World assembly passed the Trailing Trade Bill, extending the AO to Trailing, & Rimward opening the So Skire-Sitah "Back face" subsectors up for Trade & a Trade bill with the Republic of RENJ (B-86AA98-B, N, Hi In Wa 514 /Sitah/Old Expanses). Likewise, it added an extension of the AO to Rimward, and after contentious debate, admitted all the worlds of A, B, & C subsectors of Alpha Leonis Sector contacted by the RCSNR Behemoth last year as Associate worlds <P>
The most strenuous of Centrist objections came from the Oriflamme delegation, which had vociferous complaints that both Fija & Baldur, normally their Centrist allies in the RCSA Assembly, were "selling them out". Balduri representatives countered that Oriflamme had flaunted their patience and understanding for the last time. They cited the "dumping of political "dissidents", and outright criminals," into their joint Colony of Poyzen, and the Technarches usurpation on the Cemetery world-colony of L'Steich, Baldur's former home world. Baldur revoked the acceptance of Oriflamman immigrants for the time being, with a quiet fury. They also cited Oriflamme had made its own operations & "conquests" in the "Back Face", without countenance from the RCSA, or their allies. The most vociferous Federalist objections came from Aurora, Trybec& Aubaine's delegations, urging admission of Marax, Nova Rhyll, and Xezor in Thoezennt, and Tequila & Fisher's World in Shenk versus Soleean aggression, and then there were those shouting for Futok, Khirekhera, Ryvo, Bikar, and Khesanadu and Kide in Khulam, as well as Sittahr in Promise subsectors.<P>
Actual blows were on the verge of being struck until Luhtahlan Assemblyman Victor Von Hugo & "freshman" Aubani Assemblyman Sean Egan offered Oriflamme the benefits of their Trade in the newly contacted Rimward Polities of the Confederation of Phaedrus (Mackenzie Subsector/Alpha Leonis), the Clarke's Realm Federal Republic (Mackenzie & C Subsectors/ Alpha Leonis), to the Spinward RC sole A-class Starport world in Oriflamme Subsector. Ms Arsto's quiet demeanor and small stature defused the tense floor scene in the well of the Assembly by the SG's podium, shaming them into silence.
"We have new allies in our war against ignorance, xenophobia and economic stagnation.  A Stellar Polity interested only in trade two subsectors to Trailing. RENJ has no designs of conquest, unlike Solee.  They are as Centrist minded as we here in the Coalition.  Likewise these ambassadors from Lazzerton's worlds, and the Phaedran Confederacy as well as the Clarke's Realm Federal Republic We have enemies enough in Soleean space without resorting to it here where we can air our differences in civil debate! "<P>
"Gentlemen, ladies, Schalli & Mr. Ambassador of the Hiver Federation, Associate delegates of Teldora & Nex: We are at war with the mad AI-Virus, the Mercantile Guild, and the Soleean "Star Empire" not each other. We have passed the Admissions Bill, we are annexing Boneyard worlds thru the blood, sweat and toil of our citizen Salvagers and this tool called "Snake" from our Coreward friends in Sufren faster than we exhaust words here. How would you feel as a citizen of a world that had survived to be contacted with hope like these Rimward friendly states & single system worlds, and to come many parsecs here to see us quarrelling like children while they stood in the darkness still?
"Fellow Centrists, we must pass a vote on their membership as well as this Trade Bill. We cannot win this three-headed Chimera alone. We went to Sufren far away, and returned with "Snake" with which we are turning the tide on Virus, breaking the blockade of the "Vampire Highway". More ships, crews and Shipyards than our worlds have, demands more people & worlds into our Stellar Polity, the Reformation Coalition.  I have met with these delegates from Rimward. They are eager to join us, for the very reasons we are Centrists-safety in numbers in the chaos of the Wilds, security in knowing, they no longer struggle alone."<P>
" Fellow Federalists across the aisle, you advocate expansion, why are you balking now? Because the expansion isn't in the direction you crave? How shallow if it is so of you. Virus crumbles before us spinward, as the Guild's hold loosens, so it does sowing ignorance & anti-Coalition propaganda in their wake as they fall back into Diaspora. Solee threatens us with the worst uses of relic technology salvaged to Coreward.  Which does more good in our fight versus these, more low populated worlds with techno phobic humans now to Spinward, who barely can feed themselves, or worlds ready & willing to lend their backs to the tasks ahead? We will uplift and feed these destitute worlds, never fear, but they cannot carry the fight with us beyond their own worlds. When news of this vote that will nearly triple the size of the Coalition gets to Solee's Empress she will be forced to think twice, in this hazardous course she has chosen for her people! Remember the Dawn League's six worlds that became twenty in 1200? We lived thru those growing pains. So we shall again. I motion these issue to a vote, now!"<P>

Ms Arsto, in tears after the historic vote, referred to this simply, " Mark you all here, this day. On this day, Solee lost the war she so eagerly seeks with us." A twenty- minute standing ovation followed her out of the Assembly speaker's well.. To the astonishment of spectators of the vote, Professor Ilelik Kuligaan & Professor Martin Francis Rourke, rival remnant  advisors to the Coalition were seen shaking hands after the speech, in the gallery.
"Never mind we old curmudgeons," Professor Rourke said, grinning lopsidedly, "ye watch that lass, she'll be your next SG! Professor Kuligaan uncharacteristically was smiling. "The future of this Coalition seems to be in fine shape, despite our personal disagreements." Both men declined further comment.
