<P>
Most colony worlds will have substantial oceans as well as lakes and
rivers.
These bodies of water can become means of transportation between a
colony town
and its farms, or among several colony sites. Water may also be an
avenue of
exploration beyond the settled area. All you need to take advantage of
water
transportation are wet ships. Here are design sequences that enable the
Traveller New Era referee to design muscle, wind, and steam-powered
vessels
that can be built using the resources of a colony world.  Note that part
of
this design sequence uses some system and subsystem design sequences
published
in GDW's publication Fire, Fusion, and Steel.  You should have a copy of
Fire,
Fusion, and Steel available as you will need some of the tables and
other
information contained in that publication.  For convenience, Fire,
Fusion, and
Steel is often refered to as 'FF&S' in this chapter.
<P>
<H3>
The Law of Buoyancy
</H3>
<P>
All vessels that float on the oceans of a world observe a basic natural
law
that affect every aspect of their design, be they hollow logs or fusion
powered submersibles. This basic law is the law of buoyancy. Buoyancy
works
like this: if an object weighs less than the weight of fluid it
displaces, it
will float in the fluid. If it weighs more than the displaced fluid, the
object will sink.  This law applies to any fluid be it a gas or a
liquid.
Buoyancy enables steel ships to float on oceans and balloons filled with
light
gases to float in atmospheres.
<P>
<H3>
Wet Vessels
</H3>
<P>
With buoyancy as a starting point, virtually any wet vessel may be
designed
using these basic design sequences. These include:
<P>
	Non-Powered Vessels: These include muscle and wind-driven craft
	ranging from simple rafts propelled by polling or rowing to large
	sail-powered merchant vessels and warships.
<P>
	Powered Vessels:  These include surface craft beginning with TL 4
	steam-powered paddle driven riverboats and steam/sail vessels, and
        eventually continuing to submarines and hydrofoils at higher
TLs.
<P>
<H2>
Ship Design Factors
</H2>
<P>
<H3>
Units Used in Ship Design
</H3>
<P>
Displacement Tons-- This is the standard Traveller hull volume
measurement.
One displacement ton is equal to 14 cubic meters of volume (the volume
occupied by one ton of hydrogen).  In Wet Navy ship design, the hull's
resistance through the water and the vessel's resulting power
requirement to
reach a desired speed is calculated using displacement tons.  This unit
is
also used to calculate the speed that can be reached with a given amount
of
power.
<P>
Metric Tonnes--  One metric tonne of displacement is equal to 1 cubic
meter of
volume (the volume occupied by one ton of water).  It is also equal to
one ton
of mass.  The vessel's weight, the weight of the water it displaces, and
the
available free buoyancy is calculated in metric tonnes.
<P>
Cubic Meter-- The cubic meter is the standard unit of volume.  One cubic
meter
equals one kiloliter in volume.  One cubic meter of water weighs one
metric
tonne.  14 cubic meters of hydrogen weighs one metric tonne, and equals
one
Displacement Ton in volume.
<P>
Kilowatts-- One kilowatt equals 1,000 watts.  This is the standard unit
of
power for small water craft.
<P>
Megawatts-- One megawatt equals 1,000 kilowatts.  This is the standard
unit of
power for large water craft.
<P>
Kilometers per hour-- This is the standard unit of speed in Traveller.
Two
kilometers per hour are roughly equal to the ancient Terran "knot" unit
of
speed.
<P>
<H4>
Step 1: Design Hull
</H4>
<P>
Displacement is the weight of the fluid moved aside by a vessel's hull
when it
is floating or submerged in the fluid.  If the displacement of the
vessel is
greater than the weight of the vessel, the vessel floats.  If the
displacement
is less than the weight of the vessel, the vessel sinks.
<P>
Displacement is the starting point for all ship or boat designs.  It is
a
fraction of the total hull volume expressed in displacement tons
converted to
the weight of the fluid it displaces (usually water) expressed in metric
tonnes.  The percentage of total hull volume varies with hull type.  A
submerged submarine, as an example, displaces 100 percent of its hull
volume.
On the other hand, a planing hull displaces only 30 percent of its total
volume.
<P>
Displacement is calculated at one standard gravity as is the weight of
the
craft being designed. If the vessel is built on a world with a greater
or
lesser gravity, the gravity affects the weight of the fluid and the
weight of
the vessel equally. Therefore, the ratio of displacement to weight is
independent of local gravity. However, the absolute weights of the
displaced
fluid and the vessel are not. A vessel that weighs more than the fluid
it
displaces on a .7 G world will sink just as surely as one on a 1.2  G
planet.
Displacement is listed in tonnes for vessels of one tonne or greater, in
kilograms for smaller vessels.
<BR>
To calculate the displacement vs. the weight of standard hulls listed on
the
Hull Size table in Fire, Fusion, and Steel:
<P>
1.  Select a hull size from the Rate column in the FF&S Hull Size Table,
and
the material from which it is to be built from the Wet Ships Hull
Materials
Table.
<P>
2.  Decide upon the thickness of the hull in centimeters.  A thicker
hull will
have a greater armor value but it will weigh more.  The minimum
permitted
thickness, regardless of the hull material selected, should be 0.40
centimeters.
<P>
3.  Calculate the volume of the hull material using the procedure found
in the
'Hulls'section of Chapter 1 of Fire, Fusion, and Steel.  Then, multiply
this
figure with the appropriate weight modifier from the Hull Materials
Table.
Finally, multiply this number by the hull's actual thickness in
centimeters.
The resulting numbers is the hull's true weight in metric tons.  The
equation
appears below:

4.  Determine the hull's armor value. To do this, multiply the hull
material's
Toughness Modifier by the hull's thickness in centimeters.  The
resulting
number is the hull's equivalent Armor Value.
<P>
5.  Note the hull's volume in cubic meters from the Fire, Fusion & Steel
Hull
Size table.
<P>
6.  Determine the hull type.20
<P>
7.  Multiply the hull's displacement tonnage by the "% of Hull
Displacing
Fluid" figure for the selected hull type. This yields the volume in
displacement tonnage of the portion of the hull that displaces fluid and
the
volume in displacement tonnage of fluid displaced.
<P>
<P>
Figure 1.
<P>
The volume of the fluid displaced is a percentage of the hull's
displacement.
This diagram shows a curved displacement hull vessel that displaces 50%
of its
hull displacement.  The superstructure is separate from the hull and
either of
its displacements.  The superstructure's volume and weight are
calculated
separately from the hull and added to those of the hull.
Superstructures are
discussed later in this chapter.

8. Multiply the tonnage of the displaced fluid by 14, then multiply the
result by the appropriate modifier from the Fluid Density Table. This
yields
the weight of the fluid the vessel displaces. If the displaced fluid's
weight
is greater than the vessel's weight, the vessel floats; if less, the
vessel
sinks.

Methane                 0.7
</Pre>
The result is the weight of the fluid displaced by the hull.20
<P>
9. Compare the weight of the hull with the weight of the displaced
fluid. If
the fluid weighs more, the vessel will float, if the vessel weighs more,
it
will sink. In that case, build a larger hull or choose a lighter hull
material.
<P>
<H3>
Length, Beam and Depth
</H3>
<P>
Wet ship hulls are equivalent to a needle shaped spacecraft hull in
terms of
determining length from the FF&S Hull Size table.  The maximum beam
(width) of
 a hull is the length divided by 3.  Finally, determine the depth of the
hull
(from the keel at the bottom of the hull to the main deck at the top)
The
result of multiplying these three figures together should equal the hull
volume in cubic meters.  As an example, a 1000 displacement ton hull
with a
volume of 14,000 cubic meters will be 90 meters long, 30 meters wide,
and
15.5 meters deep.
<P>
<H3>
Free Buoyancy
</H3>
<P>
Free Buoyancy is the figure expressed in tons or kilograms calculated by
subtracting the total weight of a vessel from the weight of the fluid it
displaces.  This is the weight of all additional elements you may add to
the
design until the vessel sinks. Calculate free buoyancy at each step
during the
design process when the weight of new elements such as weapons, cargo
space,
superstructure, fuel tankage, and crew accommodations are added to the
design.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H3>
Weight
</H3>
<P>
Weight is the total weight of the vessel listed in tons for large craft
and
kilograms for small craft of less than one ton.  This figure includes
the
weight of the hull, superstructure if any, propulsion machinery, fuel,
cargo,
weapons, crew, passengers, and in the case of wind-driven craft, sails
and
masts.  Hull weight varies widely and depends on the size of the vessel
and
the weight per ton of displacement of the material from which the hull
is made.
<P>
<P>
<H3>
Hull Form
</H3>
<P>
After you have determined your displacement and the weight of the hull,
select
the hull form from the hull table.  This determines the resistance of
the
vessel through the water, and each hull form's resistance figure affects
the
power needed to reach a powered vessel's design speed.
These hull forms include:
<P>
Deep Displacement-- These are high capacity hulls are suitable for large
merchant ships such as tankers and bulk carriers.  However, they require
more
power to reach and sustain a given speed than other displacement hull
types.
Some 80 to 90 percent of a fully loaded deep displacement vessel's hull
is
below the water line.
<P>
Parallel Displacement-- Both sides of a parallel displacement hull run
parallel to each other except at the bow and stern.  Although easier and
cheaper to build, this hull form has higher drag than a curved
displacement
hull.  Most medium-sized merchant ships including freighters and
passenger
liners have parallel displacement hulls.
<P>
Curved Displacement--  This is the hull form used for most surface
warships.
The hull begins with a sharp bow and gently curves around the widest
part of
the hull, then tapers into the stern. The displaced fluid flows more
efficiently with less drag around a curved hull. A vessel with a curved
displacement hull will travel at a higher speed than a parallel
displacement
hull using the same amount of power.
<p>
Submersible-- This is a sealed variant of the curved displacement hull.
It's
designed for surface cruising and short submerged periods, and is
relatively
inefficient and noisy underwater.
<p>
Submarine-- This hull is optimized for submerged cruising. It's
extremely
efficient submerged, but when surfaced it generates a huge bow wave with

tremendous resistance.
<P>
Hydrofoils-- A hydrofoil hull sits in the water like normal hulls when
at
rest or moving slowly, but rides on underwater wings at speeds over
about
55km/hr. However, since the lift increases as square of wing dimensions,

while weight increases as cube, hydrofoils are effectively limited to
under
about 300 tons mass.
<p>
Planing Hulls-- This hull is shallow and wide. At rest or at low speeds,
it acts as a curved-displacement hull. As the speed rises, the hull
begins to rise out of the water, and resistance drops off remarkably.
Supported by the lift generated by its bottom, it will have a much
higher
top speed for the same power than any hydrostatically supported hull.
At speed equal to 1.8 sqrt(Length) in km/hr, begins rising out of water.
<p>

<H4>
Step 2A: Power
</H4>
<P>
Power is needed to drive the vessel through the water.  This can come
from
several sources including muscular power (from humans, other sentients
or
animals), wind power, or mechanical power.
<P>
<H3>
The Types Available
</H3>
<P>
Power interacts with the vessel's displacement and its hull form to
produce
velocity through the water.  Mechanical power can be constant and drive
a
vessel at a constant maximum speed. Wind power is variable and is
applied
through a different set of principles than mechanical power, and
requires its
own design sequence.  Muscle power may be constant for a period of time
then
decline.
<P>
After determining the hull's displacement, its material, configuration,
and
weight, the ship designer must choose the vessel's source of power. If
the
designer chooses to design an wind-powered vessel, he or she would skip
to the
wind-powered design sequence found later in this chapter. Otherwise, the
designer should continue with the powered ship design sequence beginning
in
the next paragraph.
<P>
<P>
<H3>
Powered Ships
</H3>
<P>
A powered ship may range from a paddle-powered canoe to a steam boat.
The
design sequence is basically the same for each of these vessels and any
other
vessel that has a relatively constant source of power.  To design a
powered
vessel:
<P>
Determine top design speed--  This is the maximum speed at which your
vessel
can travel.  Note that power requirements increase by a factor of eight
for
each doubling of the top design speed.
<P>
Calculate hull resistance-- Use the formula R=3D(=C3WD) x rf  where
=C3WD is the
square root of the hull's displacement multiplied by the percentage of
the
hull actually in the water and rf is the hull resistance factor found
with
each hull type in the Hull Types table. The result is R: hull
resistance.
<P>
Calculate power needed to reach design speed with fully loaded hull-- Do
this
with the formula P=3D(RV^2/2)where P is power in kilowatts, R is the
hull's
resistance calculated in the previous step, and V is the top design
speed.
If you wish to calculate the power in megawatts divide the result by
1000 or
calculate the power needed with the formula P=3DRV^2/2000.
<P>
Determine power plant-- Power plants that can be easily built on a
colony
world range from primitive steam engines available at TL 3 through TL 5
steam
turbines. Power plants available at TL's 3 through 5 are listed in the
power
plant table included with this article. These include steam
reciprocating,
steam turbine, and internal combustion. As with other vehicle designs,
install as many cubic of power plant as you need to produce the output
needed
to reach the top design speed as well as to provide for the vessel's
other
power needs. Note the weight of the power plant and subtract it from the
available free buoyancy. Also, note the total fuel consumption of the
power
plant.

Fuel Options: Steam engines of all types can be designed to use
Wood or coal instead of Hydrocarbon distillates.  Steam
engines of TL 3 and 4 can ONLY use Wood or Coal.  Also, any power plant
from TL 7 and higher can be designed to burn LHyd instead of Hydrocarbon
distillates at no energy penalty.

If wood is used, multiply energy output by 0.5 and fuel consumption by
3.

Cold-Starting and Accelerating with Steam Engines

All steam engines require
5 minutes to be cold-started.  For every 50 kilowatts of power output
(or
fraction thereof), they require one additional minute. Therefore, a
steam
engine with a maximum output of 100 kilowatts would require 7 minutes to
start.
<P>
In the event that a steam engine is not being run at maximum output, it
requires 1 minute to generate every additional 50 kilowatts of power
that it
wishes to add.  Therefore, if a 200 kilowatt steam engine was running at
only
50 kilowatts output, it would take three minutes (of full fuel
consumption)
to increase its output level all the way to the maximum of 200
kilowatts.
<P>
<P>
<H4>
Step 3A: Power Transmission
</H4>
<BR>
Determine Power Transmission-- Choose one from the Marine Power
Transmission
Table. These may be paddle wheels, screw propellers, hydrojets, or
gravitic
drive units. Note the efficiency multiplier of each unit. Multiply the
power
needed to reach the design speed with this multiplier and adjust the
power or
speed as needed. Note the weight and volume of each transmission unit
and
subtract the weight from the available free buoyancy. Where applicable,
subtract the volume from the available hull volume.

<P>
<P>
<P>
Available power transmission types, their advantages and disadvantages
include:
<P>
Side Paddle Wheel-- This is the least efficient and most primitive
marine
power transmission. These have been used aboard inland and deep sea
vessels,
mostly powered by primitive steam engines. Side wheels are best suited
for
calm waters, and may be better suited to extremely shallow waters than
screw
propellers. Also, they greatly aid steering a vessel in tight quarters.
An
experienced ship's captain can spin a vessel around its vertical axis by
going
forward with one side wheel and reversing the other.
<P>
Side wheels are susceptible to damage. A collision, debris in the water,
or a
well placed shot could destroy a side wheel. They also cause problems in
docking. And, in rough seas, they may be intermittently thrown clear of
the
water and race, causing damage to the engine by the rapidly varying
load.
<P>
Stern Paddle Wheel-- As the name suggests, stern wheels are located at
the
stern of the vessel. Because they are located in the vessel's wake, they
are
more efficient than side wheels. They are also less susceptible to
damage.
<P>
Stern wheels are best suited to calm inland waters and may experience
racing
and cause engine damage in rough ocean waters. They can also become
quite
large and bulky, and would not be suited for propelling large vessels.
<P>
Screw Propellers-- Screw propellers are the most common transmission
devices
and are the most efficient marine power transmissions for speeds up to
65 kph
at mid-technology levels. They share the advantage of paddle wheels of
not
occupying volume within the vessel's hull. And they are relatively small
and
light compared with other transmissions for the size of vessels they
propel.
<P>
Water Jets-- Using high-speed pumps to suck in and then eject water,
these
are best used on fast surface vessels. At higher tech levels, combined
with
the abundant power of fusion plants, these are the drive of choice for
high-speed submarines because of their efficiency and relative silens.
<p>
MHD Tunnel Drive: Since seawater is conductive, an electrical current
applied
across a tunnel filled with water will cause a magnetic current, forcing
the
water through the tunnel. Early models require extremely bulky,
cryogenically
cooled superconducting magnets, while the advanced models are somewhat
more
efficient.
<p>
<H4>
Step 2B: Sail Power
</H4>
<P>
Wind pressure against the sails as well as aerodynamic forces,
particularly
with fore and aft rigged sailing vessels, generate the power that drive
a
vessel forward. Because wind is variable, the force that powers the
vessel is
variable. However, since it is possible to determine the maximum number
(and
area) of sails a ship can carry without being driven under, and its
possible
to determine the force generated by the wind blowing against these
sails, the
maximum speed for a sailing vessel can be pre-determined.
<P>
Sail Configurations-- There are two basic sail configurations:
<P>
1.	Square rigged
<P>
2.	Fore and aft
<P>
These configurations may be and often are combined on sailing vessels
with
more than one mast.
<P>
Square rigged-- Square rigged sails are large rectangles of cloth rigged
perpendicular to the hull's main axis. They are designed to catch winds
coming from the stern and from within 45 degrees from either side of the
stern and take maximum advantage of these winds. To enable the vessel to
sail
courses closer into the wind and to help in tacking, a square rigged
water
craft often has a number of fore and aft sails mounted both on its after
most
mast and as jibs close to the bow. Square riggers are well suited for
worlds
with steady winds blowing from predictable directions where trade routes
can
take advantage of wind directions. Large merchant and men of war sailing
vessels are square rigged.
<P>
Fore and Aft rigged--  These sailing craft have their sails mounted
parallel
to the main axis of the ship.  They are exceptionally well suited for
sailing
with the wind coming from the beam and for sailing high up into the
wind,
where aerodynamic forces can pull the vessel along rather than push it.
Fore
and aft rigged craft are much less efficient than square riggers in
taking
advantage of a following wind because the after-most sail often blocks
the
wind from driving other sails to forward.  Choose this type of rig if
your
craft is sailing in confined waters where frequent tacking and turning
take
place, or where you can't count on a steady wind from the same
direction.
<P>
Sail Area-- The total sail area determines the maximum amount of force
available to power a sailing vessel, and consequently the vessel's top
speed.
This area depends on the height and number of the vessel's masts, and
the
length of the yards-- wooden or metal beams that run at right angles to
the
mast.
<P>
Masts may be added at a rate of one per 15 meters of the ship's length.
Large
sailing ships are known to have three to five masts, while seven or
eight
masts are not unknown on the largest ships. Maximum mast height in
meters
equals the square root of a hull's volume in cubic meters. Maximum mast
height
for any vessel is fifty meters. Yards on square-rigged ships may be 130%
the
length of the beam. Yards on fore and aft-rigged vessels equal 50% the
mast
height in length.
<P>
With a square rig, calculate the sail area based on the rectangular area
of
the total number of sails rigged on the masts, plus 20 percent of the
total to
allow for jibs and stay sails rigged at the bow or between the masts.

Fore and aft rigged vessels have basically triangular sails; one per
mast,
plus an additional 10 percent for jibs rigged at the bow.
<P>
Sail Power--  The power generated by wind on sails is determined in a
standard
atmosphere by this procedure:
<BR>
1.	Multiply the wind velocity in kilometers per hour by 0.28 to convert
the wind velocity to meters per second.
<BR>
2.	Calculate the power available in watts with this formula.
P3D {[(1286)S]V} 0.1
<BR>
Where P3D power in watts
<BR>
Where S3D sail area
<BR>
Where V3D wind velocity in meters per second
<P>
On a world with a dense atmosphere, multiply the resulting force in
watts by
1.5.; on a world with a thin atmosphere multiply by .75. Sails are
impractical on worlds with very thin or trace atmospheres.
Note:  One kiloliter of standard atmosphere air weighs 1286 kilograms.
This
determines the constant in the formula used above.
<P>
Here are two examples of how ten kilometers per hour of wind can produce
a
vastly different amount power, depending on the sail area.  The power
output
in both cases would increase as the wind velocity increases.
<Pre>
sail area    wind in km/hr   wind in m/s    watts       kilowatts
200            10             2.8         72016.00         72.016
1              10             2.8           360.08          0.36008
</Pre>
<P>
<P>
Note:  When the power output (in kilowatts) of wind on the vessel's
sails
exceeds its hull volume (in cubic meters), the vessel's sails begin to
take
damage equal to 1 point per kilowatt of excess power. If the power
output
exceeds its hull volume (in cubic meters) plus its free Buoyancy, the
vessel
is either capsized (if it has a beam wind) or is driven under (if it has
a
following wind). If the vessel has wooden masts rather than iron or
steel,
the masts break when the wind load exceeds 75 percent of the vessel's
displacement.
<P>
Sails should be shortened to reduce their area in heavy weather to
prevent
these disasters, and the ship should be headed into the wind in extreme
cases.
<P>
When the total sail area is determined, calculate the potential speed
expected
at several wind velocities. Do this by calculating the power generated
by the
wind at various wind speeds, then calculate the potential speed with the
formula: V^2=3DP^2/R where P is force in kilowatts and R is hull
resistance.
<P>
This formula is based on kilowatts of power modified by the resistance
of
vessel's hull.  Use the formula R=3D(sqrt(WD)) x rf  where WD is the
hull's20
displacement multiplied by the percentage of the hull actually in
the water and rf is the hull resistance factor found with each hull type
in
the Hull Types table. The result is R: hull resistance.
<BR>
Note that in some cases this calculation may result in vessel speeds
exceeding
wind speeds.  If this occurs, reduce vessel speed to wind speed.
<BR>
Sail Damage-- Determine sail damage levels:  Divide the total sail area
by 15
to calculate the level to destroy half the sail area; divide by 6 to
calculate
the level to destroy the sails and demast the vessel.  Double these
damage
values for extra-strength synthetic sails.
<P>
Sail Costs-- Sails cost CR100 per square meter.
<P>
Sail Weight-- Dry canvas sails weigh approximately 1 kilogram per square
meter.
When wet, increase their weight to 2 kilograms per square meter.
Synthetic
sails (TL7) weigh 0.9 kilograms per square meter.  However, they do not
soak
up water and weigh approximately the same wet or dry.  Extra-strength
synthetics (TL8) weigh 0.3 kilograms per square meter wet or dry.

Sail Stowage Volume-- Canvas sails require 1 cubic meter of volume for
every
25 square meters of sail area when stowed below decks (they may
alternatively
be furled on their yard arms.)  Synthetic sails require .5 cubic meter
of
volume per 25 square meters, and extra-strength synthetics .3 cubic
meter
per 25 square meters.
<P>
<P>
Mast Weight and Cost-- Wooden masts weight 10 kilograms and cost CR 10
per
meter of height.  Iron masts become available at TL 4: they weigh .125
tons
and cost CR 100 per meter of height.
<BR>
Steel masts become available at TL 5: they weigh .1 ton and cost
CR 100 per meter.  Titanium masts become available at TL 7: they
weigh 60 kilograms and cost CR 200 per meter.  These values include
the weight and cost of the yardarms.
<P>
<P>
Auxiliary Power-- Beginning at TL-4, auxiliary power sources may be
added.
These can include steam engines, internal combustion engines, batteries,
fuel
cells, or solar cells.  Calculate the amount of auxiliary power needed
for
the desired speed while using the "iron breeze" and determine the weight
and
volume of the auxiliary power plant.  Finally, calculate the auxiliary's
endurance, fuel requirements, and range.  Be sure to include sufficient
fuel tankage for the required endurance and range.  Remember, auxiliary
power is needed to power any on-board electronics such as radios or
sensors.  This may be included in the form of wind generators,
batteries,
fuel cells, or solar cells if power is not desired for propulsion.
<P>
<P>
<H4>
Step 2C: Muscle Power
</H4>
<P>
Water craft may be powered by muscles as well as wind or machinery.
Devices
used to transfer muscle power to thrust include paddles, oars, and
lever-
powered screws.
<P>
Oars-- Oar locks allow oars to be used as mechanical levers that provide
the
most efficient way to transfer muscle power to propulsive thrust.
Determining
the amount of power generated by rowers is based on the species and
skill of
the rowers.
<P>
The basic value for any given species that is capable of rowing is 1/2
the
species' average weight in kilograms.  The average human weighs 70
kilograms.
Therefore, the basic human rowing value is 35-- measured in watts of
power
produced by an individual human.
<p>
This basic wattage value is modified by ability.  A rower's ability is
determined by the total die modifier received for:
<P>
	Strength
	Constitution
	Small Watercraft skill level
<P>
For each point of rowing ability, the rower is able to increase power
output by
40% of the basic wattage value.  As an example, an individual with
Strength 7
(DM+1) and Constitution 7 (DM+1) has two points of rowing ability.
Accordingly, the individual's basic wattage value is increased by 2 x
40% or
80%.  This means that:
<P>
	35 basic wattage x 1.83D 63 watts of total power.
<P>
Note that well-trained, highly fit individuals can easily double this
level of
output. On the average, professional rowing crews can be assumed to
produce
two times the wattage of average individuals of a given species.
<P>
For reference, average for Vargr and Aslan rowers are given below:
<P>
Species	Avg Mass		Basic Wattage		Avg Individual
<P>
Vargr		55			27.5				50
Aslan	       	100			50				90
<P>
Oar-powered water craft require allocating 100 kilograms weight for each
human
and each rower's oar.  Allocate 150 kilograms for each rower and oar if
the
rowers are Aslan, or 75 kilograms if the rowers are Vargr.  Alocate 2
cubic
meters of volume for each human rower stationed below decks within the
hull,
3 cubic meters for each Aslan, and 1.5 cubic meters for each Vargr.

Calculate the total power output by multiplying the individual rower's
output
by the number of rowers on board.  Potential top speed may be calculated
from
the total power output.
<P>
Oars can have more than one rower to increase power.  Each additional
rower
(after the first) adds 75% of his power to the oar.  Each rower requires
one
meter of beam.
<P>
There is a limit to the number of oars that can be placed in a hull.
Subtract
twice the beam from the length of the hull in meters to calculate usable
rowing space.  Each oar in a bank of oars requires one meter within this
space.  Oars can be stacked to form more than one bank.  Each bank
requires
one meter of height.
<P>
Oars weigh 10kg each and cost CR10 each.20
<P>
Paddles-- Light water craft may be propelled with paddles.  Though this
is
similar to rowing a vessel with oars, less power is transfered because
paddles have no leverage.  A paddle will transmit 60% of the power
generated
by a rower using an oar.20
<P>
Paddles weigh 2 kg and cost CR10 each.
<P>
Muscle Engines: Mechanisms That Convert Muscle-Power to Useable Wattage
<P>
The following `engines' use muscle-produced wattage to power
Marine Transmission systems .
<P>
Levers and Cranks:  These devices are available at TL 3.  They
can only be used by sophonts, or creatures which can be trained
to perform a repetitive, noninstinctual task.  All workers re-
quire at least Adequate crew positions.  Species that are much
larger or smaller than humans may have greater or lesser requirements.
<P>
Turnstiles/Treadmills:  These devices are available at TL 1
and can be powered by any type of creature that has a movement
rate of greater than `0'.  All workers require 1 cubic meter per 10
kilograms of weight.  So a human (average weight of 70 kg) would
require 7 cubic meters of space.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H4>
Step 4: Pumps
</H4>
All vessels leak at one or more points in their lives. Leaks may occur
through damage, or through joints that gradually loosen, or through
seepage.  Water may also come aboard during heavy weather.  Because of
this, all vessels need pumps.  Pumps aboard primitive vessels are
muscle-powered.  Pumps are mechanically or electrically powered on
modern
vessels .  Be sure to install pumps with enough capacity to handle
flooding
in at least one large sealed compartment in case of damage.
<P>
Pumps are rated by the number of cubic meters they can pump per hour.
<P>
The Pump Table below gives the power required and the flow rate
generated per
cubic meter of pump volume at various tech levels.  Pumps weigh one
tonne per
cubic meter.  Power for TL2 and earlier pumps must come from muscle
power at
35 watts per person.

<P>
<H4>
Step 5: Superstructures
</H4>
<P>
All surface vessels may have superstructures built on top of their
hulls.
Superstructures increase the total weight and volume of a vessel but do
not
add to its fluid displacement.  Superstructures may range from small
deck
houses built aboard sailing vessels to massive structures almost the
length
of the vessel built to accommodate passengers aboard liners.  Cargo
vessels
and warships generally have smaller superstructures-- generally not more
than 20 to 30 percent of the hull's volume.  To build a superstructure:
<P>
1.	Determine the volume of the superstructure(s) in cubic meters.
<P>
2.	Detemine the material volume (MV) of the superstructure by the
following equation:
<BR>
	MV3D (2x(superstructure height) x (superstructure length +
superstructure width) + (superstructure length x superstructure
width))/100
<BR>
	The minimum superstructure thickness should be 0.25 cm.
<P>
<P>
2.	Convert these to tons in hull equivalent tonnage.
<P>
3.	Determine the weight of the superstructure(s) by multiplying the
tonnage with the weight modifier from the hull materials table.
<P>
4.  Determine the price of the superstructure by multiplying the tonnage
by
the price modifier for the selected material from the hull materials
table.
<P>
	Note that the hull and the superstructure may be (and often are) built
of different materials such as a wooden deck house on a steel hull.
<P>
Superstructures may be used for the ship's bridge, for passenger and
crew
accommodations, or to house additional cargo.  Deck cargo, stowed in
sealed
containers and stacked on deck become a type of temporary superstructure
on
many cargo ships.  More than one superstructure may be built.  A common
cargo ship design is the "three-islander" with a superstructure housing
the deck crew above the bow, a mid-ship's superstructure housing the
bridge
and officers quarters as well as messing facilities, and an aft
superstructure over the fantail housing the engine room crew.
<P>
<P>
<H4>
Step 6: Controls & Electronics
</H4>
<P>
Unpowered primitive mechanical or basic mechanical (at TL5) controls are
required for wet ships built in the context of World Tamers.  Primitive
mechanical controls cost MCr.0001 per displacement ton and basic
mechanical
controls cost MCr.0002 per displacement ton.  All controls displace
0.014
cubic meters per displacement ton and mass 0.0014 tonnes per
displacement ton.
Any ship that employs sensors/fire directors requires controls of a tech

level equal to or greater than the tech level of the sensors/directors.

Also, nav aids cannot be installed at a higher tech level than the
controls.
Additional controls are listed on pg 47 of FF&S.  Also, if any sensor
has
greater range than 30km, or if any MFDs are installed, a full computer
must
be installed.  Otherwise, ships with electronic equipment that doesn't
fit
the above requirement only need a Model Flt computer.
<p>
Electronics:
<p>
Sonar is the sea equivalence of Radar.  It is replaced by EMS sensors at
TL-10+.

<h4>
Step 7: Armament & Defenses
</h4>
<p>
Turrets-- Turrets count as superstructures, and in all other ways are
similar
to the turrets on normal vehicles (ie if they are more than 10% of the
volume
they are main turrets). The turrets can be retractable if an internal
volume
equal to 110% of the turret is alocated (mass is equal to 1tonne/m3 of
the
turret, and price is Cr33/m3 of the turret).
<p>
Torpedoes-- Torpedoes are designed like submarines, at TLs below 5, they
are
unguided, at TL5-7 they are typically wire guided, and at TL7 and up
they
are typically target memory or seeker guided.  Torpedo tubes are
designed
like Space Missles, except with the correct type of control system.20
<p>
Missles-- Designed as normal
<p>
Meson Guns-- Designed as normal
<p>
Particle Accelerators-- Usable underwater, either designed as normal, or
turret mounted.
<p>
Lasers-- Large DEI lasers mounted in turrets can have their HPG in the
hull.
Also, standard starship laser turrets can be installed in the ship.
<p>
Defenses-- Ships can mount ESA, ERA, Nuclear dampers, Meson Screens,
Tractor
Beams, and Sandcasters.  All but ERA and ESA are usually turret or
partially
turret mounted.

Powered Vessels
<P>
Calculate the number of crew members you need aboard your vessel.  You
will
need crew members to stand watch on the bridge, as lookouts, and in
engineering spaces.
<P>
Engineering
<BR>
At least one crew member must be provided for each five kiloliters of
power plant aboard a TL6+ powered vessel with a power plant of one
kiloliter
or greater.    If the vessel is fueled with coal or wood, at least two
crew
members must be provided for each 5 kiloliters of power plant.  If the
vessel
is to be underway for more than eight hours, enough engineering crew
members
must be provided to stand two four-hour engineering watches every 24
hours.
The engineering department is supervised by a Chief Engineer.  If more
than
one crew member is on watch, the senior watch stander is an Assistant
Engineer.
<P>
<P>
<P>
Bridge
<BR>
On merchant vessels, two senior officers, the Master and First Officer,
plus
an officer and crew member for each watch.  Bridge crews (except for the
Master and First Officer) typically stand two four-hour watches every 24
hours.  A normal merchant bridge crew includes a crew member at the helm
and a watch officer.  The bridge crew is equivalent to the Command Crew
in FF&S starship designs.
<P>
Deck Department
<BR>
Minimum of three crewmembers to serve as lookouts on watch and handle
maintenance plus one additional crew member per 1000 tons fluid
displacement.
A boatswain supervises the deck crew and their maintenance work. The

Primitive Vessel Crews
<P>
Oar-powered craft must have at least one crew member for each oar.  Up
to
four crew members may pull on one oar.  If the craft will be rowed for
more
than eight continuous hours, a relief rower must be available for each
oar.
Sail-powered craft must have one crew member per 100 square meters of
sail
in addition to the command crew, gunners, or ship's troops.  Primitive
gun
crews must include one member per every 2 kilos of each gun's weight of
shot;
e.g., a gun firing an eight-kilo shot must have four crew members.
<P>
<P>
<H4>
Step 9: Accommodations
</H4>
<BR>
Vessels which will house passengers and crew for more than 24 hours
require
extended acccommodations.  Passengers require one small stateroom or may
double up in a large stateroom.  Crew aboard steam-powered vessels
(TL4+)
are accommodated two to a large stateroom while officers each have a
small
stateroom.  In truly cramped vessels of TL 1-3 , a more basic type of
extended accommodation is available: the half bunk.  The half bunk is
either a light frame double bunk, or hammock, with just enough space for
the individual's gear and provisions.

<P>
<H4>
Step 11:Special Considerations-- Submarines
</h4>
<p>
Ballast Tanks-- Submarines have to be able to alter their buoyancy at
will.
In order to surface, it needs to be positive, to dive, it needs to be
negative, and to maintain a steady depth buoyancy has to be neutral. The

design should include ballast tanks with enough volume that, empty, the
submarine's final mass is less than its displacement, and filled with
fluid,
its final mass is greater than its displacement.
<p>
Pumps-- A submarine requires sufficient pumps to clear its ballast tanks

fairly quickly. How quickly is the designer's choice, but it will affect
how
long it takes the submarine to dive and surface.
<p>
Pressure Hull and Maximum Depth-- A sub's max depth is 15=D7armor value.
<p>
Minimal Superstructure-- The smoother the sub's hull, the quieter it
will be
while submerged. Hence, the smaller the superstructure the better,
usually
limited to a small, fin-shaped conning tower for use while surfaced.
Advanced
designs may even have retractable conning towers, which require space
within
the hull equal to 110% of their volume (they mass in tonnes equal to 10%
of
the volume of the superstructure, and costs Cr33/m3 of the
superstructure).
Note that submarine superstructures do count towards the craft's
displacement, unlike others.
<p>
Periscopes: Two types of periscope are available to allow subs to see
above
the surface, a night periscope and an attack periscope.
<p>
Night Periscope-- Equipped with large optics for maximum
light-gathering,
a night periscope requires 15m3, masses 15tonnes and costs Cr1,500.
<p>
Attack Periscope: Smaller in diameter than the night periscope to reduce

chances of detection, the attack periscope requires 12m3, masses
12tonnes
and costs Cr1,250.
<p>
Sensor/Radio Masts: Retractable masts may also be fitted to allow the
submarine to use its radios or make sensor sweeps while submerged. Radio

masts occupy 10m3, sensor masts 15m3.  They each mass 1tonne/m3, and the
maximum area of the sensors is 1m3.
<p>
Snorkels: Submarines with combination airbreathing/battery power plants
may
have a snorkel to allow them to use their airbreathing engines and
recharge
their batteries while submerged. Snorkels require 30m3, mass  and cost
Cr1,000.  Every 10 MW worth of power plant requires an additional
snorkel.

<h4>
Step 12: Special Considerations-- Aircraft Carriers
</h4>
<p>
Helicopters, VTOL aircraft and grav vehicles can operate off any vessel
with
a clear deck area big enough for wingspan or rotor diameter=D71.5, or
length=D71.5 for grav vehicles. Fixed-wing aircraft with a mass less
than 30
tons, and equipped with arresting gear can fly from dedicated aircraft
carriers. Floatplanes can be launched from ships or subs by catapult, or

lowered over the side by crane for water takeoff.
<p>
Flight Decks-- Design the flight deck as a superstructure one meter
thick,
1.1 times as wide as the hull, and as long as the hull. Increase the
final
area by 20% if the flight deck is angled to allow for both takeoffs and
landings at the same time.
<p>
Catapults-- Most aircraft require catapults to take off from carriers.
Non-aircraft carriers may have catapults to launch seaplanes.
<pre>

TL	Type	                Mass  Length    Cost Capacity
                               (tons)   (m)     (MCr) (tons)

6	Large hydraulic fixed	15	50	0.3	13=09
7	Steam fixed	        40	100	0.8	35=09
</pre>
<p>
Islands-- The small superstructure located to one side of the flight
deck
is called an island, and provides additional command and control space,
electronics space, etc. It may be retractable, in which case it requires

space within the hull equal to 110% of its volume (mass in tonnes is
equal
to 10% of superstructure's volume in m3, and cost is equal to Cr 33/m3
of
the island). Or it can be lowered down the side of the hull on tracks.
The
elevating mechanism then requires hull volume equal to 10% of the volume
of
the superstructure, and masses 1 tonne per m3 and costs Cr100 per m3.
<p>
Helicopter/VTOL/Grav Vehicle Platforms: Non-carriers may have flat,
open,
reinforced deck space set aside for Helicopter/VTOL/Grav Vehicle
operations.
Each pad costs Cr10,000, and requires a circular superstructure 1 meter
thick
with a diameter equal to 1.5xwingspan, rotor diameter, or grav vehicle
length. It can be retractable mounted by supplying 110% of the volume of
the
aircraft plus platform.  It masses 1 tonne per every 10m3 of platform
plus
aircraft.  And it cost Cr30 per cubic meter.

Sample Wet Ship Designs
</H3>
<BR>
Here are four wet ship designs created using these rules.  They are
designed
to be simply and easily constructed on a frontier world using local
materials.  They are made mostly of local wood.  Their sails are
fabricated
from canvas that can be woven from plant fibers using TL3 textile
processing
equipment.
<BR>
One powered vessel (the trawler) uses an internal combustion engine
imported
from off world, while the other (the riverboat) uses a simple
reciprocating
steam engine that can be fabricated in any TL4 foundry.
<BR>
These profiles are similar to other TNE starship and vehicle profiles
with
one addtion:  the bouyancy of the vessel expressed in tonnes of
displaced
water.  If the loaded weight of the vessel exceeds the bouyancy value,
the
vessel sinks.
