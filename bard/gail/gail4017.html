<P>     During the early days of TNE, there was a discussion on GDW-
        Beta list about using tractor and repulsor devices as
        atmospheric or water thruster engines. The basic idea was to use
        tractor to accelerate large volume of air or water towards the
        vehicle so that the vehicle would also be pulled forwards at the
        same time. An attractive feature in this kind of propulsion
        system would be its low environmental impact, since some people
        did not like the idea of using HEPlaR drives on anywhere near
        biosphere.
<P>
        There is very little information about tractor/repulsor devices
        in FF&S, so I made some assumptions.

<P>
        <B>1)</B> The gravitic attraction or repulsion field generated by
        tractor or repulsor is not a narrow beam but rather like the
        field caused by directional radio antenna. That is, the field
        may resemble a stretched "teardrop". The effect gradually drops
        off at the edge of the field.
<P>
        This prevents from using a tractor as a direct-damage weapon. If
        the tractor was a narrow full-effect beam, it could be used to
        tear off pieces of the target. ("That man, with green shirt. Aim
        the tractor at his left eyeball.")
<P>
        <B>2)</B>  The field shape can be changed by the user (within limits, as
        with a directional radio antenna).
<P>
        A narrower field could be used to affect one target at long
        range, while wide field could affect several targets at short
        range.
<P>
        <B>3)</B> The field strengths are cumulative and opposing fields cancel
        each others.
<P>
        Tractors placed on different walls of a cargo hold could
        manipulate cargo containers; a carrier ship with tractors on
        turret extenders could manoeuver shuttles into landing pads.
<P>
        <B>4)</B>  Any force has an opposing force. When a vehicle with tractor
        pulls a target towards itself, the vehicle is also pulled
        towards the target.
<P>

        With these assumptions I made some calculation to check how well
        tractor performs when used as atmospheric thruster. Here the
        tractor is used as a normal mass-flow thruster to pull air
        towards the aircraft (as propeller or rotor) or through a hole
        in a the hull (as ducted fan or lift inducer).
<P>
        Using the values from FF&S1 p.59 (or table 151 in FF&S2) with
        thrust formulas, a tractor thruster appears to be large and
        expensive, but has better thrust/power ratio than HEPlaR. The following tables show engines for constant values.

<P>
        When the thrust and power values of a 1 m<sup>3</SUP> TL-12 tractor are
        examined with mass-flow formula, the results are:
<P>
        Induced mass flow: 15000 kg/s<BR>
        Velocity of mass flow: 2 m/s<BR>
        Volume of mass flow: 12755.1 m<SUP>3</SUP> (air density is ~1.176 kg/m3)<BR>
        Equivalent rotor area: 6377.6 m<SUP>2</SUP><BR>
        Equivalent rotor diameter: 90 m<BR>
<P>
        These values suggests that the tractor has similar effect on air
        as a rotor with 45 meter long weightless and dragless blades. In the
        same way, the 1 MN tractor performs as a rotor with 130 meter
        blades.
<P>
        If an air vehicle (air-raft) used tractor as thruster engine,
        the environmental effects would be similar as with a helicopter.
        Turning the tractor to another direction would cause similar
        effects as tilting the rotor.
