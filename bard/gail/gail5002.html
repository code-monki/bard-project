<b>COALINFONET, CLASS: NEWSREPORT, DISTRIBUTION: PUSH, AUTHORITY CIN/ORIFLAMME

 MAGGART, COALITION POLITICS, TERRORISM, RCMC, ORIFLAMME MARINE CORPS</b><p>

          Bare-chested Secretary General Lon Maggart has completed his second day of goodwill tours on Oriflamme, following two full days of closed-door meetings with senior Oriflammen technarchs in Dobroye.Although experiencing a chilly yesterday, these tours are fast becoming a public relations spectacular. Each stop on the tour appears to be more enthusiastic than the one before, thanks to the Coalition leader's disarmingly vulnerable demeanor.<p>
          The first of yesterday's appearances, in and around the capital of Dobroye, were subdued events. This was due in part to the pubic association of the Aubani Secretary General with its major Coalition rival, but was mostly the result of the heavy security evidence each of these events. Widesecurity zones and phalanxes of local police, soldiers or Marines served to distance the Secretary General from his audience. Clearly dissatisfied with these arrangements and the effects they werecausing, Maggart departed from his prepared remarks while attending a children's league sporting eventin a Dobroye suburb.<p>
           "You can't tell from looking around here that I am your leader, can you, or that you are the people I have promised to serve.  It doesn't look like we belong togethor at all."  With this the Coalition Assembly leader stepped from his  podium and pushed his way through the security cordon into the crowd, shaking hands and speaking with adults and children.  When he returned to the podium he began unbuttoning his ceremonial burgundy tunic, explaining, "A boy in the rwod just asked me why everyone here is supposed to be afraid of me, and that made me think.  And I decided that maybe it's because so many people tell me that I'm supposed to be afraid of you."  Removing his tunic, Maggart exposed a bullet-proof ballistic garment, which he then removed, leaving himself exposed from the waist up.  "Well, I guess that's pretty stupid, because there is not point in my being here if that's the only thing we have in common."  Then the remarkably trim and muscular 47 year old official threw the protective garment into the crowd to the sound of wild cheering and put his tunic back on.<p>
             In the remainder of his speeches yesterday, and all of his appearances today, Magart laced his calls for unity and Coaltion common cause with references to his actions of the previous day, often in response to calls from or signs in the crowds gathered to greet him.  Following his arrival at one of the construction bays of the Bourgund Shipyards, struck by a terrorist bomb just weeks ago, the assembledworkers remained on their feet, cheering, drowning out the attempts to introduce the SG.  Finally Maggart stepped to the  podium and drawled, "Well I guess by now you'll be wondering what the old man looks like," then opened his tunic to show the crowd he wore no armor.<p>
             Maggart capped off this fourth day of his vist to Oriflamme by observing a live firepower demonstration by the Oriflamme Marine Corps and the "Spearhead" Brigade RCMC, at Devil's Throne Training Range.  Maggart who is protected exclusively by Oriflammen Marines in the form of his Secretarial Guard, watched while the 4th "Dagger" Battalion, RCMC staged a meteoric assualt to seize a landing zone, defeated a simulated attack  by grav tanks from the 1st Oriflamme Marine Division, and held the perimeter until reinforcing Intrepid grav tanks could be landed from orbit.  Behind the cover of the fusion spitting tanks, the Marines then simulated a breakout from teh lodgment, to the approving applause of their Coalition commander-in-chief.  While flames still lapped at the edges of fusion -blasted craters, Maggart and his party moved out onto the field to congratulate the young  Marines and thank them for their performance.
            Members <p>of the SG's official party refuse to comment officialy on his daring behavior of the past two days and all are visibly tense during his appearences.  One remarked, "You could say he is crazy, or that he knows what he's doing, I guess we'll know for sure in a few more days."<p>

 OF SUFREN, DLS LADYELISE, MISSING SHIP, PROMISE, STARFARING ORGANIZATIONS</b><p>

         The normally unflappable citizenry of Brusman were electrified by the twin announcement of the recovery of the survivors of the Dawn League ship Lady Elise and the opening of relations with the .Covenant of Sufren, a previously unknown starfaring civilization<p>
          The announcement followed the successful return of a rescue mission dispatched to the planet Promise in the Promise subsector. Although returning personnel ware sequestered for debriefing, unofficial reports described a nightmare world  inhabited by Virus-infected advanced technology robots.<p>
            The Covenant of Sufren is apparently a small group of inhabited worlds to coreward of the Coalition, but with a governmental structure and social outlook similar to our own. Senior assembly representatives have expressed cautious optimism concerning the possibility of cooperation between the two governments.<p>
             DLS Lady Elise was one of the first Dawn League warships outfitted to discover the fate of the original 12 diplomatic vessels. The vessel disappeared without a trace in 1200, and was long since thought to have been a victim of Vampire activity.   Initial reports seem to confirm that theory. <p>

Attention All Crews</b><p>

         RCES crews operating in Thoezennt Subsector
  are advised to be alert to any weapons or technologies
  which can be linked to the Mercantile Guild, and asociation of
  taders believed to be reponsible for distribution
  of weaponary to objective worlds throughout the Area of
  Operations. Human intelligence and concentration of 
  low-tech weapons suggest thelocation of a local manufacturing 
  center in Thoezennt of adjacent regions.<p>

        Any intelligence relating to the specific location
  or locations should be forwarded immediately to RCES HQ
  on Aubaine.<p>

RCES MIL TRAFFIC, CLASS: <b>NOTICE TO STARFARERS</b>, DISTRIBUTION:<b> MANDTY</b>,
AUTHORITY COMMANDER, RCES DAWN BASE (TRYBEC/0336/AUBAINE,
B443610-A), 12/IV/1202<br>
KEYWORDS: <b>VIRUS, HAZARD TO TRAVEL, VAMPIRE</b><p>
RC space forces have issued a Notice to Starfarers for the entire Khulam
Main, including all worlds connected by jump-1 routes from Montezuma
(2836/Khulam/Diaspora) to Khesanadu (2731/Khulam/Diaspora) star systems.
These systems appear to present an active Viral or vampire threat, and are
to be avoided until more information becomes available. Recent reports
indicate that at least two free traders have been lost in the Khulam Main to
vampire activity in the last three months, and one RCES multi-mission scout
was recently posted as past due and is now presumed to be lost.<br>
RC space forces will attempt to evaluate and neutralize these threats.
Private exploration is not advised.<br>
Exercise extreme caution when entering or passing near these systems, and if
possible, avoid passing through them at all. Even gas giant refueling is
considered to be hazardous in these systems.<p>

COALINFONET, CLASS: <b>NEWSREPORT</b>, DISTRIBUTION:<b> REDFLASH</b>, AUTHORITY CIN/NIKE NIMBUS RE NAVY ADVANCED HEADQUARTERS, NIKE NIMBUS (0732/AUBAINE, C447789-9),
18/IV/1202<br>
KEYWORDS: <b>NIKE NIMBUS, RCS EOS, VAMPIRE FLEET, VIRUS</b><p>
After a protracted and costly battle in far planetary orbit, a large vampire
ship was damaged and today withdrew from the Nike Nimbus system. The vampire
vessel was believed to be a former Imperial destroyer of the Midu Agashaan
class. Some surface bombardment of Nike Nimbus was carried out before the
attack was broken off.<br>
Coalition casualties were heavy in the operation. A combined squadron of the
RC Navy and Nimban Navy vessels engaged the vampire ship, and a number of
vessels were badly damaged. RCS Eos is known to have been lost with all
hands. Other ship losses, if any, are unknown at this time. RCS Eos, an
Aurora-class clipper, is the first Coalition major naval combatant to be
lost in combat.<br>
The death toll on the ground has already topped 30,000, and many others are
still missing and feared dead, making this the worst disaster in the short
history of the Coalition and Dawn League.<br>
Sources close to the regional naval staff report that the need to shift
fleet assets coreward and trailing in response to the growing threat from
the Soleean Empire has left the spinward frontier under-protected. The
losses suffered here today can only mean that fleet assets will be stretched
that much thinner.
