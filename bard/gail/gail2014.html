<h1>Regency Wilds Overview</h1>

<H5>by <A HREF="../../credits.html#Pete">Pete Gray</A></H5>

</CENTER>
<HR>
<P> The Regency Wilds are the area most familiar to Denebian
intelligence and patrol personnel. Comprising the worlds of Lamas,
Antra and Atsah subsectors, it contains a number of predominantly
Imperial culture worlds of mixed human/vargr populations. Many of
these same worlds came under concerted attack by various Vargr states
during the early years of the Imperial Civil War, as these invaders
took opportunistic advantage of the withdrawal of Imperial fleets
from Corridor and the Domain of Deneb's subsequent isolation.
<P>
Several worlds along the Deneb/Tuglikki interface were overrun by
forces from the Assemblage of 1116, which was created specifically to
attack the Denebians. The Assemblage failed to make much headway into
Lamas or Pretoria, but its corsairs inflicted heavy economic damage
by preying on vital shipping and attacking isolated ground targets in
lightning raids. The Assemblage was finally destroyed by Virus, after
its fleets and leadership were killed in the Battle of Ashes against
superior Regency forces. Worlds in trailing Atsah were conquered by
forces by the Dzarrgh Federate, and were picked clean by their
overeager corsair hirelings. Most of these worlds were liberated by
the coming of Virus, and in many cases their human populations were
able to partially or completely Abandon these worlds with Regency
assistance. Those populations that stayed had a front row seat as the
progression of Virus utterly destroyed their former conquerors,
leaving not one corsair group alive by 1143.
<P>
In the short period between the completion of the Abandonment and the
Rape of Trin, the surviving worlds were left to their devices. Early
viral intruders destroyed most of the region's starports and those
remaining communities on worlds that were naturally inhospitable to
life. In the wake of the Rape of Trin, the senior Denebian leadership
decided that the four parsec frontier they had erected was too thin
to deter committed viral opposition, and naval and RQS sweeps began
the laborious process of recontacting those worlds within five
parsecs of the Frontier terminator. The groundwork for such missions
was done covertly by the RQS, with jump trained agents
surreptitiously observing the locals for months before contact teams
of agents and diplomats would openly approach governments deemed
friendly or at least not overly hostile.
<P>
Many of Atsah's worlds had already fallen back into near barbarism,
the result of repeated Vampire attacks by several fleets found at the
trailing end of the Vanguard Way, the J-1 route that connects Atsah,
Ian and Khouth subsectors. Most of these worlds were under the
control of dictators and warlords that used their stockpiles of
leftover advanced weaponry to cow their populations into obedience.
Dubbed Technologically Elevated Dictators, or TEDs by RQS, their
bully boy tactics were severely damaging the future prospects of
recovery. Antra and coreward Lamas had suffered less damage, but
their lower populations meant that most worlds would eventually
succumb to demographic collapse. On Rroerruerz/Antra, however, a
deranged human technician calling himself Tutankhamen after an
ancient Solomani despot, used a strain of human friendly Virus to
reactivate the worlds largely automated military, which he used to
enslave the now mostly Vargr population to do his bidding. RQS covert
action personnel eliminated the threat he posed in a multi-stage
operation, which set the precedent for limited intervention into the
affairs of some of the worst ruled mini-states of the region.
<P>
<h3> Recovery</h3> To effect long term survival of both Atsah and Antra,
the Denebians launched a two prong plan to assist the populations of
these benighted worlds, to recover their economies and some of their
living standards, and to win their hearts and minds when, not if, the
Regency reexpanded into surrounding space. While the Regency could
have launched numerous military operations to overthrow local despots
and reclaim these worlds from the onset, their resources were already
stretched to the breaking point by having to defend what territory
they did hold, a situation exaceberated by the wrecked infrastructure
of the region, and the possible specter of local insurrection on top
of the threat of Vampire attack. With the Regency decades away from
being strong and confident enough to recover these worlds outright, a
more limited strategy of war and recovery by proxy was approved by
the First Regent.
<P>
Surviving free traders in both subsectors began to receive
substantial assistance from RQS agents. In addition to naval deep
space sweeps that gradually attrited the trailing vampire fleets,
these groups received maintenance and trade from the reclaimed naval
base at Errogel/Atsah.  Eventually limited trade between specially
vetted and inspected RQS factors and these trader coalitions was
permitted. For the most part traders brought in high value goods like
precious metals, gemstones and certain salvage items in high demand;
in return they recieved so called "high payoff" technologies for
their home communities, investment credits and hard currency to
increase the home purchasing abilities. The two main collectives, the
"Iron Butterflies" of Atsah, and the "Souk" of Antra, eventually
became the main economic lifelines of the various TEDs that dominated
both of their home areas, giving the Regency soft power leverage over
these dictators, whereby peaceful trade embargos replaced hard
military operations in most cases. Additionally the build up of a
unified economic front in both subsectors permitted the laying of
groundwork for future expansion, as the network nature of both
collectives enabled them to coordinate their industrial efforts
beyond the reach and communication of various warlords.
<P>
In case economic efforts did not suffice, the Regency dusted off the
ancient "small war" doctrine. As opposed to the "big war" concept of
intervention espoused by the Imperial Marines, with its insistence
upon the annihilation of the enemy, or their coercion into surrender
by the intimidating amount of firepower that Marine units carried,
the small war doctrine is built around more limited and less bloody
means of accomplishing the same objective. Under this doctrine,
smaller forces were used for precision strike against enemy military
infrastructures only. As one marine commander aptly put it, "To
topple governments, not mountains" through the wasteful military
force of antebellum units. Contrary to details published elsewhere
(such as Regency Vehicle Guide) more was accomplished through
targeted strikes in conjunction with diplomatic efforts than by the
specter of massive Marine intervention. Most small war forces were
originally Spec Ops and Marine Jump units used against a small number
of especially aggressive or deadly TEDs in the period of 1140-1152.
After this time Regency Ranger Training Cadres and the Navy's Task
Force 543, trained the forces of friendly TEDs to take over patrol
and deterrence roles. These forces were restrained by "they started
it first" rules of engagement that limited them to reacting to
aggressive actions by opposing forces. After the recontact of
Corfinium in 1151, a ready supply of Regency friendly mercenary
troops became available for these operations, a role which the
Corfinium Corps and their later Corvine allies took to
enthusiastically.
<P>
<h3>Progress</h3> This carrot and stick method has had noticeable results.
However the success has been more economic than military. The overall
standard of living has increased, if not to Pre-Collapse levels, than
at least to a comfortable degree. Both free trader collectives are
widely accepted in their home territories, and have increasing
economic and political clout and power overall. Militarily, early
successes have given way to long term cold wars on worlds such as
Ivora/Atsah and Rroerruerz/Antra between Regency friendly regimes and
entrenched dictatorial governments. The lack of political
representation among local populations, and the often soiled
democratic credentials of friendly warlords has stymied advances, and
more time and energy has been wasted trying to consolidate previous
military victories. It has been more productive for free traders to
buy out these dictators with money and chicanery.
<P>
Through both lingering loyalty and nostalgia, and the untiring
efforts of the RQS, its allies, and Denebian Missionaries, several
worlds are firmly under our influence. In Antra these include the
worlds of Djaelervangak, Cilnodan, Rroerruerz, Bangwe, Tchien and
Haggard. Contrary to previous written reports the Regency friendly
Khankael League on Djaelervangak has all but destroyed the
sociopathic cult that arose during the Collapse. This government
shares its name with another government on Rroerruerz; indeed they
are descended from the same Assemblage of 1116 political faction.
However the latter group is vehemently Anti-Regency, and is opposed
by the Llaegaerz League, a coalition of prewar Vargr and human
communities, including the Stormy Federation, the home nation of the
Souk FTC.  In Atsah the worlds of Dophkah (the home of the Iron
Butterflies), Errogel, Wal-ta-ka, Port Comfort, Gampin, Corfinium and
Zerderu are predominantly friendly to us, and we have significant
sympathy on Doho, Atsah and Ivora. Other friendly worlds include
Hysyl/Usani, Newpenton/Geniishir, Nibel/Namidshur, and the worlds of
Qi'iri and Gila in Lamas.
<P>
With the reopening of the Regency Frontier in 1202, economic recovery
of these worlds is expected to commence in the very near future.
Already it appears that Nibel and Errogel will be the center of
reexpansion, the former because of its hospitability and small,
scattered native population, and the latter for its visible naval
presence and well preserved infrastructure. New starports are being
built for Bangwe, Port Comfort and Gampin; plans for additional
facilities are being executed on Doho and Newpenton. Ivora remains
strongly hostile to recolonisation, and rumors of a Corfinium led
invasion are rampant, though uncomfirmed.
<P>
<h3>The Future</h3> The transition from backward dictatorial states to
modern memberworlds of the Denebian mainstream is expected to take
about ten years. Because of strong commercial ties, and the steady
flow of people Passing between the Regency frontier and the Wilds,
the locals are better accustomed to modern society than their
neibhors further out in Corridor. The short time of severance between
local communities and the blanket of naval security created less
disruption in services, and enough living memory of the technological
past has been preserved to ease the future shock of younger
generations over the last twenty years. Current priorities include:
the continuing transformation of warlord governments and the most
repressed communities into more moderate forms. Restoration of local
education, health and security infrastructures. Reconstruction of
interstellar governments and communication systems. Expansion and
legitimisation of Denebian security presence, and the subsequent
reconstruction of buildings and recruitment of personnel to present
and man local governmental institutions.
