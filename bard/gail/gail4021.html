<h1>Creating Religions in Traveller</h1>

<P>
  Religion in the game has always been treated in a curious
fashion. In the original edition, religion was seen through the
filter of 1970s social criticism: it was the residue of outmoded
thinking, and its emphasis upon repression ran contrary to the
trenchant fad of authenticity that lurched out of the counterculture.
Therefore it was represented as an oddball museum exhibit, some
knicknack dreamt up by a bunch of fuddy duddies to be both quaint and
disgusting at the same time, like an Egyptian mummy that was buried
with a dried hippopotamus penis. Religion was the opiate adminstered
to the masses by cruel tyrants like the priests of the Ram of Jokotre
(see Book 6: Mercenary and 101 Patrons) or the star worshipping "son
of a star" of Pavabid (Divine Conquest).  Or worse it was obscure and
exotic at the same time, and just a bit dangerous, like red necked
cannibal cults with air-rafts, and it looked like you were on the
menu.
<P>
When CT and the patchouli dusted 70s gave way to Megatraveller and
the bruising culture war 80s, the role of religion in the game was
partially reexamined, and it was given more shrift. Though in the
context of the Imperial Civil War it was less important than
factional infighting and the racial/cultural divides that punctured
the Imperium. And when the topic came up, it was still in a rather
negative connotation. In the wake of the implosion, religion was a
reaction against the collapse of Imperial authority; succoring the
losers and filling the void of power. Hence we were subjected to
cults that collected political power, like the Panamica Ecclesiasty
of Narquel (Astrogators Guide to Diaspora), furthered racial or
political supremacy such as the Church of the Chosen Ones (Vilani and
Vargr) and the Turin Consolidation (Solomani and Aslan), or rejected
secular society alltogether and suggested that destruction and loss
were the justified will of god (umpteenth cults in various Challenge
and MTJ articles).
<P>
These kind of depictions are to the detriment of the game. Unlike D&D
where the clash of the supernatural and magic must be counterbalanced
against the sensitivities of real world religions, religion can have
a more significant and worthwhile presence in Traveller. Aliens after
all are not transcendant Jesus or Allah-worshipping or hating in the
way that fantasy creatures are. And god is still, despite Nietzches
pronouncement, not quite dead in the real world. The following is not
intended to be anything more than just an overview on the basics of
religion and religious systems. It is not intended to be read as
either gospel or as sociology, just as a helpful crutch. It just
happened that the current discussion about the GTRC cuts across a
number of different layers in Traveller.
<P>
Background: The human invention of religion is thought to be almost
as ancient as Homo Sapiens itself. It is known from study of
Neanderthal burial sites that even this offshoot branch was capable
of veneration of the dead, so it may be rooted in a very primal part
of human existence and supersedes the invention spoken and symbolic
language, though the latter is very important in later religious
perpetuation and. To the question as to why humans developed the need
for religion beyond the simple spirituality of our more distant
ancestors is intimately connected to language and its impact upon the
emergence of modern homo sapiens about 160,000 years ago. Unlike our
Neanderthal cousins, for whom speech and symbolic abstraction was
more difficult (though this is still quite controversial), our
ancestors used language to carry themselves to a much higher state of
development than their beetle-browed neighbors. They used words and
abstraction to convey complex ideas, plan ahead several time periods,
and create complex heuristic patterns and strategies that led to
deliberate advances in technology and social arrangements. Because of
the greater success of modern homp sapiens at hunting and gathering,
and being able to manipulate his environment, religion became an easy
means of forming viable settlements and regulating the relationships
between the members of a community, and the dichotomy of both nature
and the rest of the community.
<P>
But that same symbolic advancement was stilted and awkward, since
objective logic and formal rules of complex social engineering were
still primitive. Religion filled the void in several ways, namely
because it could transform successful cultural and social
requirements into a narrative structure that relied upon conformity
of the group to enforce and follow. Spirituality is about awe and the
supernatural, religion uses those forces to create the boundaries of
community. Natural forces were antropomorphised to a great degree,
something only possible through the invention of the abstract. The
relationships between these forces could be traced through the
hiearchies of gods, and the proper degree of respect for these forces
were ritualised and codified. This enabled communities to quickly
assimiliate, and disseminate to its members, information vital for
their survival in the face of an unforgiving nature. This information
is ritualised, and sometimes become the sacred rites, when a behavior
is desired, or taboos when it is not. Hence the Bible vilified Cain
the farmer for killing Abel the herder because Cain's agricultural
lifestyle was a dangerous luxury in the Holy Land, further reinforced
by the injunction against alcohol. Mythology is a handmaiden to
religion in many cases helping to reinforce its message through
alleged historical events, though in fact the two are not the same.
<P>
Though human society has evolved significantly since its humble
beginnings, language is still imperfect at keeping pace to the
developments of science and industry, resucitating religious faith at
critical intervals when secular understanding failed. Religious
development has followed a traceable historical trajectory. All human
faiths seem to have started out as collections of animistic spirits
that inhabited every river and tree and boulder. As human society
evolved into agriculture and herding, the vast army of spirits was
reduced to a polytheistic hiearchy whose structure reflected the
power system of pre-industrial subsistence, usually as an extended
family ruled by a stern and yet benevolent king. As these communities
became pre-industrial empires built upon conquest and trade, the
centralisation of rule around unitary bureaucracies and trade cartels
caused a shift towards monotheism, which symbolised imperial power.
Finally monotheism has headed towards submergence into utopian
industrial era faiths based upon emerging sciences and technologies,
from Cartesian mechanics to Kantian critical idealism, and finally
has come full circle into a new period of religious mysticism and
pantheism, due to the "harmonisation" between secular mechanics and
religious sacristy, and the remystification of the world through
electronic media and animated or autonomous machinery.
<P>
At every crucial point of human progress or regression, the boundary
of change has been a crisis of language, with religion using its
"metastories" to lay grasp to the new order emerging from the
wreckage of the past. Given that Traveller's own fictional history is
marked by several periods of social convulsion, religion should be an
important background for game campaigns. Even events such as the
emergence of the Solomani into interstellar space and the shock of
becoming an interstellar society would prompt new development (and
perhaps that explains the GTRC, Liam). The emergence of both the
Vilani and the Solomani, the Interstellar Wars, the Long Night, the
rebirth of the Imperium and finally the Collapse and the Dark Years
are perfect religious incubators. The diversity of technology is
perhaps less impressive than the diversity and power of competing
religious faiths and their ministers. Imperial space should be
crawling with different churches, abetted by Imperial laissez faire
policies of religious freedom and nonpreference for any one faith or
creed, except where it becomes a threat to civility and Imperial Law.
In an age of great injustice or deprivation, religion empowers
communities to organise against common enemies and work towards the
common good. In other words a good religion works for the same goals
as the Star Vikings, and keep the flame with as much vigor as the
Regency. The first words of liberation in the Dark Years could come
just as much from the Good Book, and serve to better explain
motivations for characters in fighting for the rollback of the
darkness. <P>
Designing A Religion: Here is a word of advice. Ignore the section in
WBH that deals with generating religions. It is too abstract and
mechanical to do justice, and the result is too stilted and
stultifying for effective roleplaying, or to make a vital living part
of a campaign. Instead of the usual numerological obsessions, one
only needs a few guidelines for creative development of a reasonable
religion.

<h3>First Step</h3>

The First Step is simple: keep in mind what I said above.
Religion is for the formation of a COMMUNITY of assembled
individuals. It determines the boundaries and norms of said
assemblage, assigns positions of power and responsibility, and
creates a common goal for everyone to work towards. It represents its
environment through its rituals and addresses the catalyst of its
creation through its creation of a narrative that (hopefully)
resolves the perceived problem in an acceptable manner. The reality
of the supernatural entities they represent is your own business.
Finally a religion must be based around an idea that is useful for
bringing people together to work for that common goal.
<P>
<h3> Second Step</h3>
Determine the god view. Incidentally these are not
exclusive or fixed. A single religion may go through two or more of
these stages as a result of historical developments:

<LI>1. Animism: The world is governed by a diversity of different
spirits. These can occur in both the most primitive and advanced of
worlds, especially if the latter has superstitious relationship with
artificial intelligence. Animism is perhaps the least rational form
of belief as well, because its insight into the natural world is the
least developed. Primitive religions of this type are most common in
hunter-gatherer societies that live within heavily forested terrain.

<P>
<LI>2. Polytheism: These are religious faiths most common in archaic (TL
0 to 1) societies. Generally they reflect subsistence agriculture,
with a smaller number of spirits being ruled over by gods and
goddesses whose status reflects hiearchal divisions within the
commnities. In Northern Indo-European societies, for example, an all
powerful male "Allfather" was sovereign, reflecting the
male-dominated warrior cultures of the Norse, Germans, Celts and
Dorian Greeks.<P>
<LI>3. Monotheism: Imperial dominance leads to the emergence of this
system. Usually this is more related to economics rather than
military power, as trade must be rationalised according to a single,
standarised system. Most monotheisms are either one god systems that
supersede earlier polytheisms, or the god has multiple aspects or
specialised helpers that prevent a deadening effect. Dualism is a
special case of monotheism, largely because of its rarity, and
because it multiplies a single system by two, often into warring
moralistic systems.<P>
<LI>4. Pantheism: Literally "All God". Panthos are complex systems where
a single didactic god is not desired or needed. Rather all parts of
heaven and earth become the residence of god. Such religions are
ecologically inclined, where the general output of all societal
sectors must be harmonised in potentially difficult environments.
<P>
<LI>5. Deism: God removed from the machine, or god as the machine. In
early industrial societies the juxtaposition of primitive science and
skepticism can create conflict in cultures where the majority still
cling to religious certainty. Deism proposes that the universe is a
mechanism created by god, but with the creator removed somehow. This
is more of an emotional response meant to compromise than a workable
religious philosophy, though it remain to cater to people who wish to
have feet planted in both areas (like the Unitarians).<P>
<LI>6. Interactism: Offshoot or offspring of Pantheism. Interactism
removes god entirely from view, making worship rare. Instead it
concentrates upon ritualising and harmonising human behavior with a
really difficult living environment. The religion of the Dine (Navaho
and Apache) nations of the American Southwest is a good example of
this.
<P>
<h3> Third Step</h3> Determine the system of devotion and interaction
between the believer and the supernatural.<P>
<LI>1. Sacrificial: Weakest system. No emotional engagement between
supplicant and the divine. Rather a worshipper wishes to appease
potentially deadly spirits in hopes of either gaining (or at least
not losing) something held dear. Priests in such religions are
usually go-betweens for the believer and the divine fortune he or she
hopes to secure.<P>
<LI>2. Devotional: Greater emotional engagement. Appeasement of spirits
still the norm, though believers may devote themselves to all of the
particular rituals of a particular god with more enthusiasm,
especially if their profession or geographical location contains some
kind of peril or oppurtunity that requires more frequent aid.<P>
<LI>3. Programmatic: The "Book" religions are of this form. A specific
philosophy is laid down for the believer to follow in hopes of
gaining a higher reward. The time frame that this reward is obtained
varies. Disjointed mythology is usually supplanted by a common set of
themes that recur thoughout the main story, which may have a definite
beginning and ending.<P>
<LI>4. Gnostic/Cabbalistic: The revealed truth is deliberately hidden aay
from the masses. The majority of people follow a certain set of
rituals, while the chosen are a privileged minority who recieve
indoctrination in the full extent of the faith. The early Christians,
Orphic cults and the Manicheans were of this pattern. Many of these
religions usually form around newly discovered knowledge or
exclusively controlled philosophy, and use their advantage to gain
power over non-believers, the Pythagorean cult be a good example. <P>
<LI>5. Mystical: The relationship between god and his children is very
personal. Strict commandments are supplanted by specialised religious
teaching that prepares the believer for the shock of direct
experience of god. A good example is Mahayana Buddhism. These
religions are usually embraced by a much narrower subculture whose
special needs (advanced knowledge, old age, outcast status) requires
more intensive immersion into direct religious experiences.
<P>

<h3>Second and Third Step Special Case</h3>

<LI>0. Universalism: A religious system that embraces a wide variety of
different god views and devotional systems, either due to a diverse
population or to allay social tension between sharply different
socioeconomic groups. Taoism is one example, though perhaps Old
Testament Judiasm and Hinduism are even better. The latter religion
ranges from strict polytheism to pantheism, with different levels of
religious fervor tolerated by priests charged with its stewardship.
<P>



<h3>Step Four</h3>


Determine Hiearchy. <LI>MA stands for Mystic Autocracy
(Safe code E, Wilds Code 9) and MD for Mystic Dictatorship (Safe Code
D, Wilds Code 7). A religion that spans more than one world can
embody both MA and MD codes at the same time.
<LI>MA1. Living God: A religion dominated by a living god or god
embodiment. These are the rarest, and nowadays are technocults that
fetishize technology, such as Bart Kosko's "Immortality on a Chip"
movement.
<LI>MA2. Oracle/Saint: Ruled through intermediaries in alledged direct
contact with a god or its servants.
<LI>MA3. Religious Sovereign: A religious king with extensive theological
or philosophical background.
<P>
<LI>MD1. Church-State: Consensus or council ruled system, with a ruling
council of high clergy, and sometimes church bureaucrats and
influential laity. Shia Islam and Orthodox Christianity.
<LI>MD2. Dispersed Hiearchy: Complex tree system of loyalties and
obediences. Local leadership takes precedence in most issues, though
it may appeal to higher authority on complex questions. Sunni Islam
and Protestantism. Catholicism beyond the Pope.
<LI>MD3. Influential Expert: "Spiritual Guide" religion where the priest
is an advisor or counsellor to the supplicant, who is expected to do
most of their own decisions in pursuit of their faith.
<P>
<h3>Step Five</h3>
Determine the "Yin and Yang" extremes that govern a
religion. Most fall between the two endpoints described below.
<P>
<LI>1. Apollonian to Dionysian: Is a religion dominated by rationalist
thinking, or does it prefer to indulge the senses and give rule to
the passions?
<P>
<LI>2. Promethean to Protean: Does a religion encourage and aid the
advancement of human civilisation, or does it prefer the natural
environment and the company of spirits that supposedly rule it? Many
cabbalistic religions will straddle the line, reserving a monopoly of
knowledge for its followers, while keeping everyone else compliant
through enforced ignorance.
<P>
<LI>3. Render unto Caeser/and Render unto Jesus: Does a faith concern
itself with the political arena and heavily influence or dominate
government, or does it confine itself to the spiritual and ethical?
At an extreme it may ignore or even oppose the necessity of the state
in favor of a cloistered community.
<P>
<LI>4. Mammon and the Brahmachanya: Is a religion and its practitioners
heavily involved in the acquistion of worldly possessions, luxuries
or indulgences of appetite? Or does it reject all of this for a
spartan life of self denial and abasement? (Or do these satisfy the
same human need in different ways?)<P>

<LI>5. Inquistor to Guru: Is a religion governed by a severe
interpretation of the Word, from which deviation is strictly limited,
with stiff regulation over the chancellors and believers of that
faith? Or does it prefer the miracles of charismatic holy men who
wander in and out of the community from the wilderness, leading merry
mobs of disciples and hangers-on.<P>

<LI>6. Augustine to Bruno: Is a relgion largely static in development,
rejecting new intellectual developments, and opposing with sword and
fire any attempts to topple its epistemic superiority? Or does it
embrace such ideas freely and promiscuously?
<P>
<LI>7. The Mask of the Trickster: How well does a religion do in
navigating the channel between the following: the Virtual and the
Real; the Figurative and the Literal; Fictional and Journalistic?
<P>
<LI>8. Ares and Alceisas: Is a religion militant and bent upon either
conquest, or eliminating competing creeds within its hearth region?
Or is it a pacifistic religion that accepts the existence of all
other faiths and differing words?
<P>


<LI>9. Secular/Communitarian "Religions": Religion has the purpose of
addressing particular conditions, and allowing for the creation human
communities within the parameters of both faith and the boundaries
permitted by the environment. In most cases religion handles the
subjective areas that normal society lacks the power to express or
control. But on some occasions a community will specially extend the
boundaries of the priveleged area of religion into the objective
areas of normal secular society, using the particular method by which
religion secures conformity to ritualise normal life in a rigid
social order. In such cases the state and lesser attendant
authorities substitute for priests and hiearchy, and written law and
unwritten custom replace the holy texts.
<P>
A good example is the Japanese concept of Wa, or social harmony. The
Japanese archipelago was a difficult place to colonise, for a number
of ecological and climatological reasons. Numerous groups from the
Asian mainland jostled for control, leading to repeated tragedy in
the form of bloody wars, famines and massacres. Now the islands were
very heavily forested, leading to the development of animistic cults
with heavy Chinese and Korean influences. Over time the harmony
implied within this natural pantheon became the center of a system of
rigid conformity, where the immigrant population was "harmonised"
with their difficult environment. To prevent new groups from coming
in to the country, a warrior culture was developed, and a system of
Japanese Exceptionalism took root. This is not the exceptionalism
based upon relative superiority by wealth or culture, but rather an
anointed state of "first come, first served." (Now replace Japan and
Japanese with the word.... Aslan, and Wa with Akhaoye.) Another good
example is the Pushtun and their code of Pushtunwhuli. Every Pushtun
clan traces their descent from a member of Alexander the Greats
cavalry guard, and this is used as the basis of a male dominated
warrior culture that tinges every aspect of their society.
<P>
In other cases, a social club or fraternity, or a philosophical
movement may become so ritualised, or so affected by its own
certitude as to take on religious aspects and attitudes. Masonry
sometimes takes this form. (How many of our European friends have
ever heard of the Priory of Zion? Its an offshoot of a nasty Italian
masonic lodge called P2.) You could also add Ayn Rand's Objectivism
to this list, from some of the stuff I've heard. And Marxist-Leninism
most definitely.
<P>
<h3>Special Topics</h3>
<P>
<LI>A. Henotheism: Literally "All Gods." The situation that arises when
religious tolerance is liberally accepted so that several religions
compete at the same time without much social stress. The U.S. could
be currently considered henotheistic. Most Imperial worlds could be
considered such as well.
<P>
<LI>B. Science Fiction Cults: "Have you been audited today? I am an
Operating Thetan level 12,348, thanks to the millions of dollars I
spent upon the helpful audiotapes and CDs of the Church of the
Scientific Gullibility. It was easy. Following the helpful lectures
on the tapes (cost per tape: $4599.99), I learned the proper way to
bend over and spread." The development of groups like the Aetherians,
the Unarians and the Mindless Hoard of Hubbard is largely a
phenomenon of the exposure of American GIs to exotic eastern
religions during the Second World War, combined with a reaction to
the muted technological anxiety of the Cold War. So it is likely
never to be repeated in the history of this country. Though it is
possible that after the wars that end the Dark Years could see a
similar reaction to Virus, in the form of Ex-RCES flying around with
pyramid shaped hats around their heads and babbling about their
coming to grips with the power of "wilco."
<P>
If these people are encountered in your campaign, it is always best
for you to deal with them with as much live firepower between you and
them as can be carried in both hands......
<P>
<LI>C. Racial Identity Cults: The Church of the Chosen Ones seems to be
rather mawkish as it is originally written, since racial supremacy is
not usually a universal goal for a culture. But it reflects the same
tension that is seen in the so called "Christian Identity" movement ,
which is not Christian so much as being vehemently Anti-Semitic and
Pro-Aryan, whatever the last is supposed to mean (how many Iranian
and Indian immigrants do you see wearing a hood and burning
crosses?). COTCO exists because the Vargr are extremely sensitive,
and frankly bewildered, over their special status as an uplifted
sentient race. Most problematic is that they have not evolved far
beyond their original pack mentality, and their fluid culture is
inconsistent and anarchic compared to competing human states. The
Vargr have a self-image problem in regards to humanity, and the only
way to compensate (at least for a few) is to proclaim their
superiority over humanity in a self-serving and chauvinistic manner.
Such cults need not be just Vargr, though this is perhaps the most
extreme case in the whole game.
<P>
<LI>D. The Blood of the King: This is a variation of the King Arthur
tale. If you remember the movie "Excaliber" there was this convoluted
relationship, based upon Celtic myth, that the health of the land was
linked to the benevolence of the king that ruled it, with prosperity
and fecundity being a mark of approval for the head honcho. Of course
Arthur buys the farm at the end of the movie, and his body is carted
off to the Island of Avalon barring his eventual return as England's
king at the end of time. Of course this simply says that "what is
good, even the idea of a mythical non-entity hyped up by that
medieval hacke Mallory, will never die." Naturally such a goofy idea
abets some really goofy religious development. The aforementioned
Priory of Zion for example "believes" that Christ survived his
crucifixion, sailed off to Southern France with Mary Magdalene, and
settled down to have a family, and his descendants later became the
Merovingian kings of France. After their unlawful usurpation by the
Carolingians, they went into hiding, and through the efforts of the
Priory, Europe is being prepared for the revival of the rule of the
children of the King of Kings(*). As rank as that sounds, the
disenfranschised people of Brazil actually started worshiping a dead
Portuguese king in the early 1900s, an otherwise lackluster monarch
that had been dead since the 17th Century. The Brazilian government
got upset, and its troops killed most of them at a little town called
Canubas. Yes the competence of a monarch is always less important
than the idea, so take heart Chuck and look forward to the day that
the Old Hag dies, and you take over the throne at the merry age of
eighty.<P>

It would be interesting if there existed cults in the former Imperium
that resurrect dead emperors for veneration. I don't mean recently
dead ones like Strephon or Varian. I'm talking groups that worship
Cleon the Mad or Jacquelline. (Mad Cultist: "Do you accept Cleon IV
Zhunatsu as your rightful sovereign and savior?" RCES Lancer: "Who
did you say?" MC: "Zhunatsu." RCES:"Oh! Gesundheit!")
<P>
(*) What makes this smell even worse, is that if Christ had
descendants, any random person on this list and myself have a 90%
chance of being a direct lineal descendant of Him as well. Last I
checked no one in my immediate circle of friends can walk on water.


<P>

<LI>E. Syncretism: The mixing of different religious traditions, often
for political reasons. This is more than just theology in most cases,
with monotheistic religions often mixing into older polytheistic
traditions in areas where they are trying to attract converts. The
most notable case is Roman Catholicism, which started out as a fairly
strict and austere religion emphasizing the acceptance of the New
Testament and strict devotion to the formerly Jewish god. But as the
new faith spread outside of the Holy Land, it encountered an ancient
Mediterranean polytheism centered around a bevy of pre-industrial
gods and animistic spirits. To usurp these spirits and their pagan
holidays, the early church fathers were flexible enough to adopt a
method of beatification, whereby valorous and virtuous priests and
monks were raised into semi-divine status that allowed for a
circumspect degree of worship, thereby substituting for polytheistic
spirits. This tradition lives on in the Christian holidays, all of
which happen to coincide with ancient pagan harvest and fertility
festivals (Christ was actually born and crucified in the summer).
<P>
The advance of major monotheistic religions always give way to
syncretic development. Islam is perhaps the most syncretic of
religions, mixing in with, and oftentimes being dominated by, local
tribal traditions and mythology in nearly every country it is
encountered (and prompting the ironic recognition among Islamic
clerics that the United States, having no such traditions, is the
only country that Islam can be practiced as it was originally
intended). Catholicism mixes heavily with tribal traditions in Mexico
and Brazil, Protestantism with animistic rites in Subsaharan Africa.
Tibetan Buddhism is a mixture of traditional animism and imported
Mahayana saint worship. Universal religions are by their very nature
syncretic; Hinduism ranges from stock spirit worship to strict
monotheism (Sikhism) to veneration of influential yogis to admixture
with Western tradition (Hare Krishna).
<P>
In Traveller syncretism is either little more than chrome or it is a
major issue, especially when one religion is dominant over a large
swath of interstellar space. While Lewis Roberts has stated that his
Word of God religion does not have saints, it is not beyond the
limits of reason for SOME local congregations, especially of new
converts, to include such a system to appease their new followers.
<P>
<LI>F. Religious Hearth States: Nations or states that embody or
epitomise the core theology and virtue of a particular relgion. These
are usually countries that did not undergo significant syncretism, or
whose political and cultural traditions run roughly parallel or are
in the most agreement with the core identity of a church. This
identification does not necessarily lead to strong religious fervor,
it DOES require that the affected nation and its people internalise
unconciously the core theology of that faith within its daily life.
In our own world several such states exist: United States
(Protestantism), France (Roman Catholicism), Russia (Eastern
Orthodoxy), Iran (Shia Islam) and India (Hinduism).
<P>
France is perhaps the best example of this process. Do the French bug
you? Are they rude, stuffy and downright obnoxious? Do they make fun
of your attempts to converse in their language? Blame the Church.
Outside of the United States, where the Mother Church has been
reduced by our core Protestantism to being another congregation,
Catholicism is elsewhere a civilization. It envisions the creation of
a perfect or harmonious Christian community that reverses the taint
of Original Sin created by Adam's fall from grace. In medieval and
Pre-Revolutionary France, the Church handled most education, and here
it had the greatest oppurtunity in laying a heavy handed mixture of
both educational basics and cathecism. Since the seed of sin is most
evident within the young, priests and nuns were compelled to not
spare the rod in an effort to drive that compulsion out of their
charges. The result is a highly cohesive culture that is based upon
willing repression of the young, whose successful transition into the
adult world is rewarded with a coveted place in mainstream society,
albeit within the scheme set down millenia ago. Though church
attendance is very low in France (and across most of Europe for that
matter) it is actually irrelevant in the eyes of the local clergy
given the heavy influence that their faith still plays in shaping
French culture. The French respect intellectualism, and have a
tendency towards a material culture that rewards pious and sometimes
self-abnegating moderation rather than American style gluttony
(contrast Santa Claus with Pere Noel). Even French superciliousness
is rooted in the church, as their demands of strict communal order
tends to make them deeply disparaging of outsiders who simply don't
know any better.
<P>
<LI>G. Magical/Psionic Cults: The existence of psionics adds an unusual
wrinkle to religious development. All religions claim the ability to
perform miracles, especially for more hard pressed populations. Now
that the Third Imperium no longer exists, and the Psionic
Suppressions are a part of a departed era, psions that survived the
Collapse are in a position of power and influence. To less advanced
cultures even the existence of just a few individuals with common psi
powers such as telepathy can be a huge boon to the survival of
communities ravaged by war. How this is to be played by referees is
subject to some major discretion. Psionic dominated religions may be
as divergent and diverse as normal beliefs, and perhaps more so since
they are based upon the dispensation of power rather than theological
discipline. These cults are likely to be as violent and unstable as
their ancient Masonic and Mithraistic forebears, though some might
adopt their own theologies to rationalise their existence and improve
their longevity.
<P>
Normal magical cults are likely to have survived into the New Era.
Some people, for both good and bad reasons, may simply decide that
the knowledge of technology should be confined to a narrow elite to
whom the secrets have been revealed after many years of faithful
service and heavy study. It is worth remembering that such religions
are Cabbalistic, and their power dependent upon their monopoly upon
knowledge. The return of interstellar society might well upset their
dominance, with violent confrontations between their faithful and the
vanguard of new multicultural states such as the Regency of Deneb and
the Reformation Coalition. These religions are violently unstable at
any rate, as they depend heavily upon charismatic founders, and their
theology is ultimately more useful to their hiearchy than to their
followers, who will ultimately opt for more affirming beliefs.


<P>

Lets evaluate the <a href="../dani/dani7006.html">Word of God</A> faith just as an example.
<P>

<LI>Community Goal: Unclear. Though I imagine that its puritanism
appealed to Imperials exhausted by excessive materialism. There seems
to be some Mormon inspiration, and Mormonism is built upon a strong
consensus of community that was lacking in 1830s midwestern America.
The wishy-washy nature of the Third Imperium leading to despair?
<LI>Devotional System: Programmatic. A very clear path of development
exists, based upon adherence to the written moral codes of the faith.
<LI>Hiearchy: Originally a Church/State adhering to a Religious
Sovereign. Now an Informal Hierachy fragmented into warring faiths
each calling the other "heretic." Now here is a little problem,
because the disunity of the faith might be more than its tolerable
for future reconciliation.
<LI>Yin and Yang extremes: The Word of God is Apollonian and Promethean
dominated, with little mysticism. It is meddlesome in politics, down
to judging the fitness of interstellar secular institutions, giving
it seperatist leanings that limit worldly wealth and interaction. The
Word is law, and the penalty for heresy is both severe and made very
clear to all who would deviate. A very didactic faith that may be
given to heavy literalism. It is also a very militant faith.
