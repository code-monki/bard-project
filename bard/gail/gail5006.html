Fijan Naval officials reported that an unknown party has begun broadcasting
on the emergency broadcast channel at 1420.5 MHz.  The channel is normally
reserved for space vessels to make emergency calls for assistances and aid.
So far the broadcasts seem to consist of single male voice singing love
ballads.  Officials assure the public that the broadcasts are purely 
analog and there is no danger of Virus contamination. The broadcasts 
do not seem be originating from the immediate vicinity of Fija and its two moons. 
Until further notice, a new emergency frequency has been established at
1110 MHz. Fijan Defense force will monitor the situation continuously.
Major Thom Ling of Space Force said "This is serious, it jeopardizes the
safety of all spacegoing vessels, when we find the lummox responsible,
he is in a heap of trouble"

Fijan authorities have determined the source of the mysterious singing
heard on the Emergency Broadcast Frequency. They have been localized
to a starship stranded 1-2 lightyears from Fijan's sun.  The voice
has identified itself as <a HREF=../dani/dani3601.html>Reginald</a> and has professed his undying love
for Venticuulor, Fija's primary star.  The ship is almost certainly a
Vampire ship, which either misjumped or otherwise stranded itself
in deep space.  Space Force is tracking the signal, so they can better
localize the signal, so that warship can be dispatched to destroy the
Vampire. It is estimated that it will take about two weeks to triangulate
the signal well enough that a ship can jump in close.  
<P>
On a side note, Reginald has gathered quite an audience, many listeners
have tuned to hear his pleasant melodies.  Ice miners in the ring system
of Geroas, the largest gas giant in the system are particularly
devoted fans.  Jenna Dias'tra is quoted as saying "I listen to him every
night, he sings me to sleep like an angel.   In the last week or so
he has started to compose his own songs and even a bit of poetry.
Most critics have attacked the lyrics for being melodramatic and cliched.
It is unknown what the news of Reginald being a Vampire will have on his
 listeners.

While Space Force is about to launch a mission to destroy the Vampire ship 
Reginald, his growing legions of fans are protesting his destruction.  They 
claim he is a threat to no one. Jenna Dias'tra of the "Save Reggie Society"
declared that he was one of the greatest artists of all time, and he is a 
treasure of the Fijan people.  The fans gathered in Vlack park and staged 
a peaceful rally in support of Reginald, or Reggie as his fans call him.  
It ended with the crowd listening to a collection of his songs.

Professor Lucas Flint of the Auroran Institute for Technology has issued 
a statement condemning the pending destruction of the Vampire ship Reginald.
 Prof. Flint claims "Here is a perfect opportunity to study the psychology of
 a Vampire, without endangering human life.  The Vampire is trapped in deep
 space and unable to infect anyone. If we study this harmless ship, we can 
better learn to cope with its more lethal brethren." Prof Flint announced 
that he was taking the next available ship to Fija, to plead his case to 
Fijan authorities.
