<B>TL0:</B> After decades of astronomical observations (possibly longer), stones are
arranged such that the local star is observed to cycle through a monument.
One cycle becomes the basis of the local year. The day is measured by the
position of the primary star in the sky.
<P>
<B>TL1:</B> The first chronometers, devices able to measure the day, appear. The
sundial, shadow clock, and water clock each try to offer ways to measure days
without direct observance of the local star. Each relies on natural phenomena
(light & gravity) to measure time. Each is accurate, at best, to 15 minutes
per day.
<P>
<B>TL2:</B> The first mechanical clocks appear. Two hands denote the passage of
time. One hand indicates the hour while the other the minute. In some
instances, a third hand appears to mark the passage of seconds. The chiming
of bells is often used to mark the passage of the hours. The cost and
incredible size of these machines make them cost-prohibitive to all but
institutions and aristocrats.
<P>
<B>TL3:</B> Pendulum clocks, which rely upon a planet's rotation for calibration,
improve mechanical timekeeping to 1 second per month accuracy. Decreasing
costs and size increase their availability to the masses.
<P>
<B>TL4:</B> The first "pocket watches" appear enabling people to carry timepieces
around with them instead of relying upon structures to house them. Accuracy
is sacrificed for convenience. These watches, which rely upon hairsprings and
balance wheels, are accurate to within 30 seconds per week and have to be
wound up regularly to ensure consistent timekeeping.
<P>
<B>TL5:</B> Pendulum clocks peak out at an accuracy of 0.3 seconds per year. The
first quartz clocks are introduced. Accurate to 10 seconds per year, these
devices measure the vibration of quartz crystals as electric current is
passed through them.
<P>
Watches are now equipped with straps to be wrapped around appendages (arms in
humanoids).
<P>
<B>TL6:</B> Timekeeping takes a big leap forward thanks to advancements in physics.
The ammonia clock measures resonance in ammonia molecules interacting with
microwaves. Its accuracy is 1 second per 5 years. The first cesium clock,
accurate to 1 second in 100 years, redefines the second as 9,192,631,770
cycles of the cesium atom's resonance frequency.
<P>
Clocks become embedded in appliances, computers, and vehicles. Their presence
in society becomes ubiquitous.
<P>
Personal watches increase in accuracy. Tuning forks bring accuracy to within
one minute per month. Quartz clocks are shrunk down to become watches and are
accurate to 5 seconds per month. Their high price makes them unaffordable to
the general public.
<P>
<B>TL7:</B> The first commercial masers appear. Accurate to 1 second per 274,000
years, masers measure hydrogen frequencies and are more stable than cesium
clocks.
<P>
Watches diversify. Liquid crystal displays, alarms, chronometers, and water
resistance (up to 100 meters depth or 14 atm pressure) all appear.
<P>
<B>TL8:</B> Cesium fountain clocks appear. Their accuracy is 1 second per 20 million
years. High population planets become increasingly dependent upon the
reliability of these clocks as global synchronization becomes crucial to
staving off chaos.
<P>
Watches increase in sophistication and precision but decrease in price such
that all can afford them. Quartz watches decrease in price but remain status
symbols.
<P>
<B>TL9:</B> Stored-ion clocks appear. These clocks are capable of trapping atoms for
indefinitely long observations. The appearance of gravitic technology enables
clocks to ignore the effects of gravitational fields upon their ability to
measure time.
<P>
Advances in wetware computer technology enable watches to be implanted
underneath the skin for those that wish it.
 <P>
<B>TL10:</B> Advances in gravitics enable researchers to develop clocks which are
immune to the effects of gravity.
<P>
<B>TL11:</B> Gravitically immune clocks appear in all vehicles which utilize
gravitics.
