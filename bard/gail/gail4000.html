Philosophy (Social Science--EDU): The rational investigation of the
truths and principles of being, knowledge, or conduct.  It differs from
Research skill, in that the investigations which takes place are not for
the purpose of seeking out a specific piece of information (the
manufacturer of a drive component, the leader of the Daibei Faction
during the Rebellion, etc.), or even necessarily involve the use of
research materials--the focus is instead on gaining an understanding of
the basic principles and concepts of  the sapient condition with a view
to possibly improving, reinterpreting, or reconstituting them.<P>

   Philosophy is subdivided into three broad categories of study:
Natural Philosophy which concentrates on gaining a better understanding
of the physical universe, Moral Philosophy in which the emphasis is on
the proper conduct  and interaction of sentient creatures with each
other, and Metaphysical Philosophy which is concerned with the larger
questions of existence, causality or truth (Why are we here?,  Do we
really exist?,  What is the origin of the Universe?,  What are the
limitations of knowledge?).  For purposes of roleplaying and generating
character color, a player can designate an area of specialized study for
each 2 skill points, as with the History Skill.  Unlike History,
however, no advanced degree is required.<P>

   Philosophy can be used as an enabling skill for Persuasion (allowing
the individual to better formulate their arguments), as an enabling
skill for scientifically-oriented tasks (allowing the character to
better grasp overall concepts), or as a substitute or an enabling skill
for Willpower (at the referee's discretion) in certain situations.<P>

   This skill can include or influence other social science (even "hard"
science) disciplines as well.  Priests and other serious students of
Religion (i.e. St. Augustine or Martin Luther) usually have high skill
levels of Philosophy and History.  Political philosophers (i.e. Thomas
Jefferson or Edmund Burke) have high levels of Philosophy, Admin/Legal
and History skills.  Economic philosophers (such as Karl Marx or Adam
Smith) have high levels of Philosophy, History, and Economic skill. 
Philosophy skill allows an individual to go beyond increasing level of
knowledge in a particular field of study to apply that knowledge to a
view of the world which may be unique and possibly (though not
necessarily) influential on others.<P>
