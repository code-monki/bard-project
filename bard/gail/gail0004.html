Granddad's old rapier still would have been TL-10, even if he got from
his
Granddad, TL 9.  It would light, strong, hold a good edge, and be very
expensive.  Engraving, craftsmenship, like the Sylean TL 10 revolver.
For
Nobles, made by one of a few well known sword makers.  A particular
sword
could be associated with various noble titles.  "The Snartbartfast Blade
is
only carried by the Count  (Countess) of Snartbartfast.  Ownership is
passed
along with the title.  Knightly orders may have a blade that is
presented
to it's members when they are knighted.  Sort of like a KofC blade, but
more functional.<P>

What's a good solid Imperial Marine Cutlass like?  Heavier than the
rapier,
keeps an edge through the Marines hitch.  Even when it's used to chop
firewood, or to pry the lids off wine crates.  Oh ya, it has to stay
looking good.  Is there an Imperial Sunburst on the bell guard, along
with
the Unit insigna?<P>

A crate of surplus Imperial Marine Cutlasses would be worth their weight
in
gold (or any other material you want that they have) on a world with a
TL
less than 4.  <P>

Perhaps the cutlass a Marine receives when he musters out is an award.
Top
Marine NCO in the Battalion for that year.  Presented to officers who
complete the Advanced Ground Tactics course in the top quarter.  That
sort
of thing.
These cutlasses would be engraved with the award, and perhaps the name
and
unit of the owner.  The information would be on the blade or inside the
bell guard.<P>
