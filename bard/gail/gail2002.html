<P>
<B>Adamantium LRC:</B> The Regency's second largest
corporation. Adamantium, along with LSP and
Morning-STR, is one of the Regency's three "universal"
products manufacturers, and a member of the so called
Big Five. It primarily concentrates in transportation
equipment, starships, power generation equipment, and
an array of automation and industrial technologies.
The company was founded on Mora in 1133 by
industrialist Hoseki Eikawa, who bought up the
scattered Denebian divisions of now defunct Imperial
megacorps, and cobbled together a fully functioning
company. Like its bombastic founder, Adamantium is an
aggressive company, and a constant thorn to the older
LSP.  Adamantium is one of the largest R&D
underwriters in the Regency.
<P>
The company's ships, robots and transportation
equipment is well built and of very good reputation.
It has shipyards at Rhylanor/Rhylanor, Mire/Daryen,
Karin/Five Sisters, Maitz and Mora/Mora, Ara Pacis and
Magash/Sabine (flagship yard), Starn/Inar (Plant 62),
Vincennes and Dekha/Vincennes, Tobia/Tobia (Plant 88),
and Lintl/Vestus.
<P>
<B>AI Race:</B> Competition between Regency government and
private consortiums to be the first to develop a
man-made Artificial Intelligence. The contest has
existed since 1152, and massive sums of money and time
have been spent by interested parties to accomplish
this nebulous goal. But the payoff is quite serious,
the creation of machine intelligences that are not
associated with Virus, and are resistant if not immune
to viral infection.  A prize of ten million credits,
plus royalties of ten percent was posted by the
Regency government as an incentive.  In recent years
the contest has come down to a three way struggle
between small firms/public research teams on Mora,
Dekha and Vincennes. Allegations of sabotage, bribery
and shady dealings with the Flame of Purity movement
have plagued the projects and their associated
personnel for years, and they have gotten worse as the
finish line has come into sight. Current estimates say
that a full functioning AI will be achieved by 1218.
<P>
<B>The Big Five:</B> The five largest Regency corporations:</B>
Adamantium, General Products, Grand Design, Ling
Stanard, and Morning-STR.  All of these companies are
generally concerned with the design, development,
manufacture and distribution of the material goods
that connect and comfort Regency society.
<P>
<B>Deneb Sector Shipping Companies:</B> In addition to
Transstar, several relatively smaller companies also
ply Deneb's busy trade lines. These include (in
diminishing size):</B>
<P>
<LI>1. <B>Aster Nova LRC:</B> The Regency's second largest
shipper. The company is also a larger passenger
carrier than Transstar, an inexplicable anomaly.
<P>
<LI>2. <B>Lodestar LRC:</B> Large passenger hauler and bulk
carrier. The company used to be quite active in Trojan
Reach and parts of the Marches, until it was busted by
MoJ for repeated violations of the Quarantine codes.
<P>
<LI>3. <B>Ohtori LRC:</B> Private spinoff of Transstar. In recent
years the company has taken over many of TS's less
profitable lines. In the last year it has quietly
taken over several of Transstar's more profitable
regions and facilities in several interior regions, as
TS ships have disappeared from active commercial
service. Ohtori is Japanese for "Phoenix."
<P>
<LI>4. <B>Sovereign Lines LRC:</B> Transport subsidiary of
McClellan Factors.
<P>
<LI>5. <B>Sky River LRC:</B> Formerly part of Ginga Transport of
the Marches, which was forced by it shareholders to
divest itself of its Deneb Sector holdings after
several major scandals threatened to undermine its
profitability.
<P>
<LI>6. <B>Wonderworkers LRC:</B> See description below.
<P>
<B>Geek:</B> Modern term for a person who spends an
inordinate period of time working or mastering a field
of study, hobby or artform.  As opposed to a
workaholic, geeks are perpetually concerned with
actual accomplishments. There is no industry in the
Regency today that does not trace its existence to the
tireless efforts of technicians and researchers
toiling in windowless labs and basements.
<P>
<B>Heartland:</B> Theory of geographic development. First
proposed after Terra's Second World War by a Solomani
writer named Mackinder.  The theory purports that a
nations economic wealth is concentrated in its
interior, and therefore development will pattern
itself away around areas of mineral and biological
wealth. Subsequent research has shown that this is
only true of a small number of nations and regions
producing primary goods, that in industrial and
post-industrial societies development follows the
Rimland pattern.
<P>
<B>Invisible Hand:</B> Misinterpreted reference in Adam
Smith's "Wealth of Nations", the authoritative book on
the existence and importance of free markets. The
Invisible Hand only appears once in a later chapter
towards the end of that venerable text, and its refers
not to the limitless perfection of an unfettered
market, but to a perfected human morality minus greed,
cruelty and license and other market impediments. As
with so many Enlightenment thinkers, Smith is simply
arguing a preference, in this case for free markets,
but is implying pessimism about its doctrinal
realisation. Yet, as with many parts of Karl Marx's
Das Capital, this statement has been repeated
countless times in history by pundits and polemicists
who ignore or forget the original context.
<P>
<B>King Jupiter:</B> Regency's largest retail chain and
warehousing firm.  Founded in 1141 by Huang Mu-Xing,
who named the company after a pun on his own name.
King Jupiter started as a department store on
Beaxon/Gulf, and was renowned for its low discount
prices, ample product lines and ease of shopping and
ordering. But the company really took off through
aggressive marketing and expansion into grocery
(Huang's Club) and small retail (Olympic) fields in
Deneb and Reft Sectors during the 1150s and 60s. The
company has begun experimenting with producing its own
"nanofacturing" technology, whereby its retail store
and much of its inventory can be reproduced by a
single small unit that can be leased or rented out to
interested consumers for their own whim or disposal,
and the company would make a profit off of sells of
data packages and refills of material tanks. The
company's cartoonish logo of Jupiter king of the gods
is almost as familiar in Deneb and Reft as
Astroburgers silver 'A' on an Imperial sunburst, a
trend accelerated by a crossmarketing alliance between
the two companies. KJ is given to outrageous marketing
stunts, a habit encouraged by the self-promoting
antics of its famous founder.
<P>
<B>Labor Shortage, Regency:</B>  The increasing division of
services and labor along lines of comparative
advantage has dramatically altered the economic power
of so called "unskilled" laborers. The segmentation of
the Regency economy has diminished the available labor
pools at the same time that increasing specialised
technology requires hard working and dedicated
professionals. Across a major section of service
industries, from food service to child care, it has
become increasingly difficult in recent years to fill
these positions with existing labor markets.  This
trend has accelerated the buying power and wage
increases of these markets, though not prosperity, to
the level of a decent living wage. The opening of the
Frontier is expected to intensify this situation, as
the higher returns of colonial development attracts
many younger workers out of the Regency Safe.
<P>
<B>Lensman LRC:</B> Small shipbuilding company based upon
Deneb/Usani. Lensman had been an antebellum specialty
builder of yachts and high performance racing craft,
but the advent of the Civil War forced it to expand
into military and paramilitary markets. Lacking
expertise in manufacturing large military starships,
it tried its luck at building SDBs and fighters. But
the company really found its niche at the beginning of
the Collapse, when it began building cheap conversion
kits for constructing planetoid SDBs and Monitors.
The company has nearly exclusive control over the
innermost belt of nearby Eshamlil/Usani (Deneb 1826),
from which it culls suitable rocks, which are then
outfitted with parts manufactured on Deneb. Or the
company just ships the conversion kit to a frontier
system, which slaps it on a planetoid obtained
locally. The construction of these planetoid fleets
were a timely and affordable addition to local defense
forces during the early years of the Collapse, and
remain an important part of Frontier defense fleets.
<P>
<B>Ling Standard Products LRC:</B> Former Imperial Megacorp.
In antebellum times the company produced everything
short of the kitchen sink. Compared to most of its
Imperial era brethren, LSP was quiet and modest, and
it success had less to do with chicanery and scheming
than with solid corporate policies and management.
But the desolation of the Imperial environment has
given way to the extremely fluid and competitive
markets of the Regency, and LSP has had to struggle to
maintain its dominance in the face of new corporate
competition. That it is still the largest company in
the Regency is testament to its management and
corporate vision, and it remains the benchmark by
which all corporate activity is compared.
<P>
LSP is still a primarily general manufacturer, though
its starships and vehicles are the most noticeable of
its massive product line. It maintains its
headquarters at Lunion/Lunion, and regional
headquarters at Tobia/Tobia and Dekha/Vincennes. It
has shipyards at Rhylanor/Rhylanor, Lunion and
Strouden/Lunion (both the largest private yards in the
Marches), Pallique and Mora/Mora, Ffudn and
Glisten/Glisten, Edenelt/Trin's Shroud, Tobia,
Seleen/Sabine, Starn/Inar (largest private yard in the
Regency), Isurkun/Star Lane, Dekha (Plant 12) and
HRD/Vincennes, Qevar/Gulf and Pikha/Zeng.
<P>
<B>LRC:</B> Abbreviation for Limited Regency Corporation.
Replaces the older LIC and AG suffixes. All Regency
corporations that are held over from the Third
Imperium were required to undergo rechartering and
licensing in the 1130s, and no Imperial-era license is
currently honored by the Corporate Licensing Board.
<P>
<B>Morning-STR LRC:</B> The Regency's third largest company,
and one of the so called Big Five. Morning-STR is
headquartered and intimately linked with the fortunes
with Vincennes. The company was founded in 1079 by
Albana Morning, a female industrialist/scientist
prominent in the local electronic industry. For most
of the antebellum period, the company was a fair sized
manufacturing firm that produced many of the goods
marketed by Vincennes famous "G" corporation. Because
of the limited markets for its high-tech products, the
company was confined to Vincennes and its immediate
vicinity. But the Post-Collapse need for TL-16
technicians and scientists to assist the Regency
government and military permitted the company to
finally escape the bounds of its homeworld, and it has
grown mainly through contracts in assisting the
construction of the Regency's emerging TL-16 research
and development infrastructure.
<P>
The company "backpedaled" many of its TL-16 products
to lower tech levels, and aggressively marketed them
to other worlds and on the general market to obtain a
market share in anticipation of the lifting of the
TL-15 cap. Like LSP and Adamantium, Morning-STR is a
general manufacturer, though its product line is a
full quantum leap ahead of its rivals in many cases.
The company makes nearly as much money assisting other
worlds in working their own way to the TL-15/16
boundary, and it is thought that when the cap is
lifted, the company will probably overshoot its rivals
into markets where it holds an overwhelming technical
and industrial lead. The company is not content to
rest on its laurels in the face of intensifying
competition, and it is a dangerous rival to any would
be TL-16 manufacturer.
<P>
Morning-STR has shipyards on, Efate/Regina (Plant 60)
Mora and Fornice/Mora, Magash/Sabine, Askigaak(the
military's Plant 30), Norg and Imone/Star Lane,
Preslin and Beaxon/Gulf (Plant 33; these are military
only facilities and therefore not reflected in UPP),
Vincennes, Taburi Nen and Dekha/Vincennes, Lilad,
Depot Beta and Pikha/Zeng, Neumann/Gazulin, and
Tobia/Tobia. Morning-STR produces mostly TL-15 ships,
and a growing TL-16 product line for government and
large commercial buyers.
<P>
<B>Multiworld Cartels:</B>  Large Imperial era companies that
operated on more than one world in a variety of
developing industries. These companies are a residue
of the expansion driven nature of the antebellum
Imperial economy. As befits its name, the Third
Imperium was an empire, and it followed an imperial
pattern of economic development. The multiworld
cartels would spearhead a drive into a previously
underdeveloped region of the Imperium, generally
through primary industries. Because of the wealth to
be gained through untapped natural resources,
competition was fierce, which made the acquisition and
processing of these resources more efficient.
Eventually the construction of industrial base would
occur, and the megacorps would dry up the the local
markets and push out the smaller cartels into some
other area of the Frontier to repeat the the process.
<P>
Since the Collapse many cartels have had to adjust to
closed markets and a different pattern of development.
Most now dominate the less well developed regions and
worlds of the Regency's frontiers through diversified
services like transport and manufacturing, or run
profitable businesses in areas prohibitive in cost and
expense for the larger Big Five companies or their
contemporaries.  Rather than being the first wave of
imperial pillage, multiworlds are now concerned with
development of remote backwater worlds for their
eventual integration into the emerging TL-15 to 16
mainstream. In many cases, however, cartels seem to
have a fairly liberal interpretation of the term
development, and some are little better than their
antebellum ancestors. With the opening of the
Frontier, signs exist that they might revert back into
Imperial habits, a development that might be
unavoidable for the next few years:</B>
<P>
<B>Multiworld Cartel Companies:</B>
<table>
<TR><TD>Blackhawk            <TD>Barracai Technum
<TR><TD>Diaspora             <TD>GaE
<TR><TD>Interglobal          <TD>JAX/TCP
<TR><TD>McClellan Factors    <TD>SpinDev/Ventureprise
</table>
<P>
<B>National Industries:</B> Public industries owned or
maintained by communal, planetary or local governments
for the benefit of the entire population. With the
increasingly network nature of Regency corporations,
and intensifying competition between urban centers,
national cartels are the primary means of economic
exchange between larger government and economic
entities, and local communities.
<P>
National companies generally are the main providers of
labor, supporting infrastructure and power for the
industrial operations provided by the Regency
government, and the Big Five, Residual or Multiworld
companies. About ninety percent of all workers in the
Regency that work for the bodies listed above actually
draw their pay and benefits from their local
governments or contractor. Contrary to what might be
expected, these bodies do not supplant or remove labor
agitation, and Regency laws strike a reasonable
balance between workers and employers.
<P>
<B>Post-Affluence:</B> Term in reference to the emergence of
the Regency middle class.  The accumulation of equity
and property by a broad spectrum of the population
tends to encourage attitudes of pragmatism rather than
polemical and divisive ideological politics.  While
the middle class is prosperous, that prosperity
depends in large part upon overriding communal trends
such as economic efficiency, public peace,
maintainment of public education and other civil
amenities that can only be maintained by government
action. The term "middle" class can therefore refer to
both its mid position between extremes of wealth and
poverty, and between the traditional liberal and
conservative opposition.
<P>
<B>Primary:</B> Adjective referring to industries or markets
that are organised around the search, harvest and
processing of natural resources such as ores,
farmland, lumber, animal products, petrochemicals, raw
fossil or solar energy, and precious metals and gems.
<P>
<B>Rimland:</B> Theory of Geographic development. In
opposition to Heartland theory, Rimland proposes that
a nations economic development will advance from
primary to secondary and tertiary goods, which
requires the convenient location of urban centers and
production facilities to facilitate cheap and timely
transportation, and the shortest possible distance
between all sources of materials and markets.
Consequently most urban development will occur along
the margins of a large country, such as coastlines or
national boundaries.
<P>
The Third Imperium showed a mixed structure between
both Rimland and Heartland development, as many
interior sectors like Diaspora and Core were lightly
populated compared to Vland and Solomani Rim; but at
the same time inefficient development policies and
unrealisable expectations encouraged growth in regions
like Massilia and Ilelish.
<P>
In many ways the Imperial Civil War was a battle of
economic expectations versus the realities of the
integrated Imperial market; there existed no logical
economic reason why Ilelish and other rebellious
interior sectors should be as highly developed as rim
sectors. And yet previous industrial development,
subsidised by the Throne and its megacorp viceroys
encouraged the accumulation of primary industries and
fleetingly profitable secondary industries in these
areas. The breakdown in cultural cohesion and
fragmentation of the Imperium was essentially an
attempt to regenerate frontiers that would be
adavantageous to these leftover regions. In hindsight,
however, the loss of the common Imperial market cost
these areas more than fragmentation gained, a case of
throwing the baby out with the bathwater.
<P>
<B>Schunaman und Sohn AG (SusAG), LRC:</B> Former Imperial
megacorp. SusAG was founded around 500 in the Imperial
Core, and made its fortune off of the manufacture and
sell of psi-drugs.  When these became illegal with the
Psi Suppressions, the company branched out into the
manufacture of chemicals and pharmaceuticals.  While
highly profitable, and possessing a stellar reputation
for product quality, the company was dogged by
Imperial authorities over allegations of abuse and
corruption on a scale worse than any other Imperial
era Megacorp. The surviving Post-Collapse part of
SusAG has an equally spectacled past, with run ins
with Regency and Spinward Hinter governments over
smuggling, production of contraband and illegal
materials, and often boorish behavior by its
management and private security services.  In recent
decades the company has been hurt by increasing
competition; a failure to adjust to new technology and
fund basic R&D has caused its profits and market share
to slip, and its dominance has been eclipsed by rivals
like General Mechanics and Sternmetal. The company
maintains its headquarters at Glisten, and regional
headquarters at Pretoria/Pretoria, Pikha/Zeng and
Neumann/Gazulin.
<P>
<B>Secondary:</B> Adjective referring to industries or
markets that are organised around the conversion of
primary energy and materials into manufactured goods.
<P>
<B>Tertiary:</B> Adjective referring to industries or markets
that are organised around the provision of services
such as sales, bureaucracy, medical and child care,
customer service and marketing.
<P>
<B>The Triangle of Enterprise:</B> All societies are
suspended to some degree between three different
economically productive organisations:</B> the
entrepeneurial, the intellectual and the
organisational. Each organisation possesses different
structures, economic goals, and function. None of
these three are dominant, nor contain the absolute
truth, but provide together all of the main ideologies
and truisms of a functioning and advancing society.
<P>
<LI>1. <B>Entrepeneurial:</B> Concerned with the creation and
fostering of private businesses and their supporting
networks.  Such worlds are disdainful of the
bureaucratic and economic hand-wringing of more
comfortable and mature worlds; behind every great
fortune is a great effort that requires the
dismantlement of older established orders protected by
bureaucratic rules slanted more towards protecting the
status quo, than in delivering the fair and equitable
society that they so often claim. A good example of an
entrepeneurial world is Beaxon/Gulf, whose
traditionally hidebound bureaucratic government has
given up more and more authority to the vibrant
business and intellectual community that has destroyed
and remade its economy to great success in the last
twenty years.
<P>
<LI>2. <B>Intellectual:</B> Concerned with the creation of a
better future. Few human accomplishments are gained
through random accident, the majority requires
deliberate thought and experimentation. These are
worlds dominated by universities, research labs and so
called "technosalons."  Compared to entrepeneurial
worlds, these worlds are less interested in the
tangible yet ephemeral requirements of profit, and are
can be more experimental and flexible in their
political and economic development. Creation is
attended by destruction, and messy nature of science
and technological development are unsupportable by
either the market or the government, and must exist in
a temporal and spatial zone of its own, according to
its own pace. Examples include Vincennes/Vincennes and
Magash/Sabine.
<P>
<LI>3. <B>Organisational:</B> Concerned with the maintainment of
order and public virtue. Despite the disdain of the
entrepeneurial, bureaucracy is the third oldest
profession for a reason:</B> the abstract world of
information requires human attention, and it is ill
served by the mood swings of the market, or the
creative anarchy of the university.  Organisational
worlds have highly organised workforces, orderly and
safe streets, well maintained infrastructure, and the
trains run reasonably on time.  Here the concern has
less to do with making money or rolling back the
frontiers of knowledge than in providing an
environment in which the material and spiritual glue
of society can be fostered and flourish without undue
disruption. Organisation worlds include places like
Ashasi/Inar and Deneb/Deneb.
<P>
<B>Turnstile Economy:</B> The complementary market structure
of the Stronghold.  The offcenter location of that
region, abutting the Great Rift, puts it in close
proximity to both the Regency Frontier with the Wilds,
and the border with the Aslan Hierate.  Producers
therefore have a choice of two markets, and can either
shift production and supply networks depending upon
conditions in either, or can specialise to a highly
efficient degree.  In both cases, the Stronghold is a
strong and stable supplier of vital industrial goods
required by defense forces in both regions in
maintaining the Quarantine, and in the future, any
reexpansion into the Wilds.
<P>
<B>Visible Hand:</B> The manifestation, through the
governments execution of laws and standards, of the
morality of a community in reaction to market forces.
Contrary to the doctrine (as opposed to the idea) of a
self correcting market, or a market that is benign in
its correction, a community and its represenative
authority (government) may act pragmatically in
compensating or counteracting the impersonal forces of
commerce through simple and modest actions.  Phrase
coined by Solomani social scientist Theodore Lowi.
<P>
<B>Wonderworkers LRC:</B> Surviving remnant of the Gvaenoks
interface shipping line, a Vargr company that once
served all of Gvurrdon and most of Tuglikki Sectors.
The company survived the arrival of Virus and the
establishment of the Quarantine, but failed to survive
an internal schism that wrent apart the company in
1145. The sole Regency based section of the company
went independent, and serves the coreward edge of the
Regency, with heavy concentration in Deneb along the
frontier. The company employs both Vargr and human
workers without discrimination, and retains a fleet of
scheduled j-3 traders complimented by roving j-2 free
traders.
