<h1> Project Valhalla</h1>

<P>
Our good friend Strephon was a perceptive man. He saw
that his empire had ossified and was in danger of
internal collapse because of competing factions. To
stave off such a future, he incorporated a number of
projects that would revive the Imperium and restore
popular trust in its institutions. But as is the case
with many such plans of imperial rejuvenation,
Strephon's were rather late in bolting from the barn,
and it was a situation of "too little, too late, too
slow, too bad."
<P>
But Strephon was also a prudent man as well. He had
long range contingency plans just in case it all fell
apart. First and foremost was Project Jumpstart.
Second was Project Valhalla, a program of secret ship
construction, and fallback depots and manufacturing
facilities placed at strategic intervals around the
Third Imperium. Unlike Jumpstart, however, the
logistics of Valhalla were so great that it was
unlikely to be completed in Strephon's lifetime. But
it fostered a number of brainchildren and epitomised
the high water mark of the Third Imperium's
technological development.
<P>
The project was divided into four parts:
<P>
<LI>1. <B>Project Vulcan:</B> Construction of automated starports
and factories in the "shadow" of Imperial naval
depots. This was Valhalla's greatest accomplishment,
as nearly every sector (with the exception of Solomani
Rim, Spinward Marches, Trojan Reach, Diaspora and
Empty Quarter) receiving several covert facilities. A
notable example of such facilities in the Regency of
Deneb include Coshecawat/Sabine (Deneb 0816) and
certain facilities within the infamous "Spinward
Defense Complex" of test ranges and secure factories
in Gulf Subsector (Deneb M). Most "Plant #" facilities
are modelled directly upon Deneb Depot Alpha "Aqua
Metamorphosis" facility, which is located in deep
space almost 600 AUs from the primary.
<P>
Such facilities range from small automated Zero-G
furnaces and kilns, to the large AI run shipyards made
famous in Regency vids. Most facilities built before
1105, however, had rather primitive AI systems built
on architectures similiar to the Kinunir's; these were
high maintenance and are unlikely to remain operative
after the Civil War, but Regency crews are still
cautioned about approaching such facilities for
possibility of Viral infection. Post-1105 facilities,
which includes Aqua Metamorphosis, were designed with
newer Quantum systems in the wake of Strephon's
concerns over the uncontrollability of Herzoch Stearns
Deyo chip derived AI Virus. These systems were not
designed to be as intelligent as the Cymbeline chips,
but Regency personnel have reported strange activity
and evolutionary behavior in these systems as well,
and caution is dictated nowadays for approaching ANY
Vulcan facility.<P>

A selected number of Vulcan facilities were designed
in case of a total collapse of the Imperium, and would
give its descendants the ability to rebuild the
Imperium from scratch provided that a Jumpstart cache
bearing information on such a facility was first found
and its contents deciphered.  Every Cache has a
protected memory that provides coordinates to Vulcan
facilities, but these only become available when TL-12
is deciphered by anyone who has opened and is using a
cache, and only when installed psych-profiling
programs identify a person or persons as being
suitable for such knowledge (in other words, no
dictators or would be Space Caesars). Known as
"Phoenix Eggs", these were mostly microfactories that
would demonstrate basic stellar level technology and
industrial techniques, acting as a seed for industrial
and infrastructure renewal.
<P>
<LI>2. <B>Project Arkidgi:</B> Previously described
<P>
<LI>3. <B>Project Avalon:</B> Pentecost decided to construct an
additional ship program in addition to the <I>Arkidgi</I>.
These included the <I>Avalon</I> class Battlecruiser and the
<I>Hierophant</I> Frigate. Unlike the Arkidgi, however, these
vessels were intended for a "worst case" happening.
The <I>Avalon</I>'s were only built in small numbers, and the
Hierophants fell under Project Forge (see below) and
became part of Lucan's vaunted Superweapon Project.
<P>
<LI>4. <B>Project Forge:</B> Intended to construct escorts for
the Arkidgi and Avalon. The only part of Valhalla to
be revealed to Lucan (and apparently Dulinor as well,
thanks to his spies). Details of Forge are hard to
come by, as it was only in its preliminary design
stages when Lucan came to power. But from the sketchy
information provided to Strephon by his loyalists on
Capital, it apparently incorporated a "sane" version
of the Deyo chip or some other advanced AI system
based upon the Deyo architecture that would be capable
of building and controlling a fleet of automated and
autonomous ships.
<P>
WHETHER THIS IS THE SOURCE OF PUPPETEER VIRUSES IS
UNKNOWN AT THIS TIME, AND SUBJECT TO SPECULATION.  No
details of this fleet exist beyond a few plans stolen
by Strephon's agents, including schematics for a
"parasitic" data architecture based upon existing
silicon based systems. Certain Vulcan components would
allow for the creation of a mobile, jump capable
shipyard limited only by the availability of resources
and spare parts.
