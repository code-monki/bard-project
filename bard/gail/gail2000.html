<HR>
<P><B>Absolute Advantage:</B>   An economic grouping, such as a
planet or corportation, has an absolute advantage over
it trading partners if it is able to produce more of a
good or service with the same amount of resources or
the same amount of a good or service with fewer
resources.
<P>
<B>Ahriy:</B> Aslan term for the Pride, or extended family by
relation and marriage. It is headed by an Aewar.
<P>



<B>Anti-Assimilation:</B> The complete and utter rejection of
the assimilation of friendly Virus strains into
mainstream society. This objection follows the signing
of an Extension Coda to the Spinward Accords in 1147.
Most of the Regency mainstream can be described as
being Anti-Assimilation, a lingering aftereffect of
the Rape of Trin, though it is rather ambivalent and
equivocal. A true Anti-Assimilationist is one that
categorically rejects the idea that Virus and other
sentient species can ever coexist together. The most
articulate and thoughtful of this group tends to avoid
the genocidal thinking of the so called
"Exterminationist" line of reasoning, generally
proposing various schemes for placing friendly or
non-threatening viruses into a reservation or homeland
where they can be segregated from the rest of society.
<P>
<B>Belgariad Sojourn:</B> Former interstellar state, located
in Egyrn subsector (Trojan Reach B) apparently founded
by a disgraced Imperial admiral sometime after the
Wars of the Imperial Throne.  The Sojourn barely
deserved being called an interstellar state. By the
time of the Imperial Civil War, the government on
Belgard could barely maintain what few starships it
possessed. In 1120-1121, an Aslan clan called the
Hlearkhea invaded the state, and quickly swept aside
the feeble defenses. The local human population
eventually recovered from the shock, and have become
somewhat cooperative with their new overlords since
the Collapse.
<P>


<B>Bluejackets:</B> Nickname for members of the Commonwealth
Police Service. Made in reference to the sky blue
dress tunics worn during public ceremonies.
<P>
<B>Codices of Sakolusalo:</B> The 64 volume written authority
for Aslan customs, courtesies and rituals. The codices
are applied by Fait Accompli Aslan to all of their
subjects, both Aslan and Human. Contrary to what has
been reported by other authorities, the Codices are
inconsistently applied, as each clan has its own
interpretation of how they should be applied in more
obscure or special circumstances. Naturally, most
captive Fait Accompli populations are resistant to the
imposition of these codes into their lives, and fuels
most of the conflict that still tears apart the
Thinrim.
<P>

<P>
<B>Borderland:</B> Old name for the non-aligned worlds in
Trojan Reach sector between the Third Imperium and the
Aslan Hierate. These worlds were settled entirely by
Imperial culture humans, though in a few cases old
Rule of Man and Long Night era colonies were already
extant. The region was non-aligned by virtue of its
economic backwardness, and a mutual desire on the part
of both the Imperium and the Aslan to maintain a
neutral buffer zone between themselves. The Imperial
Civil War led to a breakdown in Aslan recognition of
the Peace of Ftahalr, and Ihatei swarmed over the
weakly defended worlds in a lightning attack in
1118-1119.  Frequent guerilla activity and the locals
pronounced resistance to assimilation has impeded the
Hierate's control over these worlds, as has continued
tensions with the Regency. Very little has been done
to resettle or develop these worlds for the Hierates
benefit.
<P>
<B>Commonwealth Police Service:</B> The enforcement and
investigation arm of the Regency Ministry of Justice.
The CPS was formed in the 1130s to rationalise the
diffuse, and oftentimes shadowy presence of Imperial
MoJ police agents in the Antebellum period. By
centralising its police services, the Quarantine
Service in space, and the CPS dirtside, the Regency
made clear its intent of legitimising the rule of law
among its enforcement, investigation and judicial
organs, in direct contrast to the repressive methods
of noble and Imperial police services.  The CPS is
charged primarily with the investigation of violations
of all Regency laws that apply across interstellar
jurisdictions, though its charter prohibits operations
of paramilitary nature (in other words, no Wacos), and
its jurisdiction is limited over Quarantine violations
and smuggling.
<P>
Most worlds with a population of 7 or more, or 5 and
an A-class starport, contain a CPS office. Industrial
and high-pop worlds often have several offices.  Most
of these are generic field offices of 100-300 agents,
divided into several areas of jurisdictional
responsibility. Larger offices include full forensic
and investigation facilities equipped with the latest
modern equipment and procedures, and these render
assistance to local planetary police upon their
request. The CPS has its own transport branch, though
it is prohibited warships of any kind, and its vessels
may only carry defensive armaments.
<P>
Besides investigation, the CPS provides bodyguard
protection for the Regent and his/her family, a
deliberate break from the military protection afforded
the emperor/empress. It is also responsible for
domestic intelligence gathering against criminal
threats, a role that provides some controversy, and
counterintelligence operations.
<P>
<B>Comparative Advantage:</B> An economic grouping has a
comparative advantage in the production of a good or
service that it produces at a lower opportunity cost
than its trading partners. Some groups have an
absolute advantage in the production of several goods
relative to their trading partners. Some have an
absolute disadvantage. They are inefficient in
producing anything, relative to anyone else. The
theory of comparative advanatge argues that it is
better for a country to specialise in the production
of those good it is least inefficient at, compared
with producing other goods.
<P>
For example, let us say that Alphatel has 250 credits,
with which it can invest in speculative manufacturing
ventures. It has two choices, either producing
computers at 5 credits a piece, or producing
holovision sets at 10 credits a piece. Its neighbor
and trading partner is Betamac, which has 210 credits,
and can produce either computers at 15 credits, or
holovisions at 12 credits a unit.  Alphatel has an
absolute advantage in both markets, and could
manufacture both if it wanted to.  However the most
efficient division of its money only allows production
12 holovisions (120 credits) and 26 computers (130
credits).  By contrast Betamac can produce fewer of
each in combination. But if Alphatel were to
concentrate all of its money in computers, it could
produce 50 at 5 credits a piece. Betamac is less
efficient, but it has a lower oppurtunity cost in
producing holovisions, as it can manufacture
approximately 17.5 units if it concentrated solely in
that market. By specialising, more of each kind of
good is made.
<P>
Comparative Advantage is the basis and justification
of all trade.
<P>
<B>Complementary Markets:</B> The ability of two parties to
gain everything they want by engaging in trade with
each other with the desirable goods as a medium and
commodity.  An example of a complimentary market is
two countries, one with a surplus of grain, and the
other with a surplus of iron. By trading their surplus
for the other's, both are content.
<P>

<B>"Dark Ascension":</B> The shadowy undeclared wars between
Aslan clans that have existed since the Collapse. The
rules of formalised clan wars are rarely honored by
human resistance groups, whether on Fait Accompli
worlds in the Regency, or non-aligned worlds conquered
in the so-called Borderland region.  The tendency of
these groups to exploit hostilities between two or
more warring clans has forced many occupying clans to
adopt extreme measures to protect themselves and their
territories, and to continue force projection. Most
interclan wars are now prosecuted by so called
"Champion" Brigades of mercenary or retainered Aslan,
or solely by assassin brotherhoods. Trekhyair are now
reserved solely for keeping the human natives under
dewclaw and thumb.
<P>
This reliance upon units hired for both for money and
professional courtesies, rather than the traditional
ties of feodality, has had some unintended
consequences.  Many of these units have amassed great
amounts of wealth and power themselves. In some cases
they have exceeded the agreed upon terms of honorable
war, and have persecuted or overthrown their
opposition, or wrested control of their lands and
vassals for themselves.  Many members of the Tlaukhu
are distressed by this growing trend of cultural
backsliding, but are in no position to remedy its
effects.
<P>
<B>Delphi Foundation:</B>  Non-profit organisation dedicated
to preserving the traditions of the Third Imperium.
Delphi was founded in 1134 by surviving members of the
Tukera family, and its charter dedicates the
foundation to financial and moral support for
preserving Imperial tradition, culture and governance.
 Naturally such a body has been a strong bastion of
conservatism and opposition in the face of Norris'
reforms.  At times the Foundation has been either a
magnet for resistance by the nobility, or has limply
supported the governments initiatives in an attempt to
weaken or confuse popular support.
<P>
<B>Ekho:</B> Aslan term for the immediate family. It is
headed by a male Tao'.
<P>
<B>Extermination:</B> The destruction of all Virus through
whatever means possible. This line of thinking was
more common in the early days of the Regency, and was
whipped into hysteria following the Rape of Trin. It
has diminished in power in mainstream society, largely
because it is not based upon any clear logic, other
than a pronounced fear Virus motivations and
capabilities.  The unimaginative inflexibility of this
philosophy, and its demand of a war of all sentients
against all Viruses, also has little appeal to the
mainstream. Most Exterminationists are now found
within some areas of RQS, though these are generally
more and more vilified and isolated.
<P>


<P>
<B>Fidelis Controversy:</B> The controversy surrounding
unidentified experiments occuring at a former outpost
of the now defunct Research Station in Fidelis (Trojan
Reach). Delta was a class 4 containment facility used
to carry out chemical and biological experiments that
were too dangerous for experimentation on more
habitable worlds. The facility was abandoned and
evacuated in 1120 as the Domain of Deneb could no
longer guarantee its security. After the Regency
retook the system in 1131, the restoration of the
facility took the backseat after other existing
concerns, and the colony charter was sold to a small
belter collective from Zaibon/Lunion. The Regency did
retain a containment facility on a planetoid
designated HH-4301, but it was a low priority facility
until about 1135, when the government restricted
access to the facility and the surrounding space.
After the Rape of Trin the facility was quietly
interdicted, and a large region of space around it was
closed off to civilian traffic. Even in that period,
rumors swirled that it was a containment facility for
Viruses captured by the Navy and RQS, though those
same rumors indicated that HH-4301 was a "deathrow"
that kept viruses long enough for classification and
analysis before being destroyed.
<P>
But the leaked RASAC archives hint that the facility
was more than just a safe disposal facility, and that
an extensive subterranean facility had been hollowed
out of the rock in the 1140s. Given the 156 km
diameter of 4301, this is a very large facility
indeed.  The archives also hint at lengthy deceptive
techniques to disquise the massive ship traffic that
the facility was recieving for the last sixty years,
and indicated a sizeable security garrison to protect
the facility from attack, including a regiments worth
of Marines backed by Meson deep sites.  These
revelations have thrown the Regency public into a
tizzy, as the extent of the facilities and its
importance seem to indicate a major viral breeding
facility, or something worse. Since 1200, several
attempted perimeter break-ins have been reportedly
carried out by protestors and hardline
Anti-Assimilationist groups. To date the protests have
been peaceful disruption, and the now fully visible
defense garrison has been restrained in its actions.
<P>
<B>Free Association, State of:</B> The formal term for
"client state." In a state of free association, the
lesser party defers external affairs and defense to
its bigger protector, but retains internal autonomy
and the continuance of its culture and society.
<P>
<B>Free Soil Worlds:</B> Those worlds in the Thinrim that
were not declared Fait Accompli after the Collapse,
and are under the rule of a government formed on the
organisational frameworks, or out of the veterans, of
Anti-Ihatei resistance groups. Some chauvinists go
further, proclaiming that worlds absolutely free of
Aslan inhabitants are the "true" free soil, but these
people are fortunately few.  Free Soil worlds have
mixed reactions towards Aslan in the Regency; most
profess few or no reservations about acculturated
Regency Aslan, but are cold and often hostile towards
"traditional" Aslan, especially those clans that
control Fait Accompli worlds.  The irony that most
Free Soilers have to trade with the Aslan to survive
is often conveniently ignored.
<P>
<B>Fteirle:</B> The proper name for the "Aslan." Regency
humans persist in using the older, more pejorative
name.
<P>
<B>Glorious Empire:</B> Former Aslan breakaway state. The
Empire was founded by a disgraced Aslan clan in 650,
among the the worlds of Goertel subsector (Trjan Reach
J. The clan conquered several nearby human colonies
and reduced their populations into slaves.  Despite
the dishonorable nature of this state, political
considerations prevented the Hierate from acting
against these upstarts. The Imperial Civil War altered
the balance of power in Trojan Reach Sector, and
Ihatei invaded the Empire in 1118. The Empire's forces
put up a hard fight, but in the end the Hierate's
honor was satisfied, and the capitol world of Syoakh
(TR 1027) was bombarded into submission with nuclear
weapons. The Empire has been completely reabsorbed
into the Hierate, and the treatment and living
conditions of its human subjects are now on par with
their Aslan neighbors.
<P>
<B>God's Portal:</B> Second company founded by Frederick
Midashi. Under the pseudonym "Franklin Broome",
Midashi registered the company on Neumann in 1168.
After assembling a "dream team" of geneticists and
physicists, he restarted his bizarre and dangerous
experiments.  But where Prismodyn had merely explored
the realms of atomic and molecular research, God's
Portal was Midashi's application of the material he
had translated from his alleged "Codices of the Elder
Races." Midashi never left a clear record of what his
objective was, but documents seized from the company
in 1173, after his second disappearance hint at a mad
plan to recreate biological life in a plasma or
quantum medium. As with Prismodyn, Midashi's financial
and sexual escapades, and alleged embezzlement of
investor funds eventually got him into trouble. The
company went into recievership in 1174, and was
purchased by an investment group from Mora the
following year.  God's Portal remains a small if
innovative research company, again reflecting
Midashi's organisational and scientific genius.
<P>
<B>Grand Design:</B> Former design studio and engineering
office of the now defunct Imperial Megacorp GsBAG.
Grand Design was the company's main design group in
Trojan Reach and Reft, and had been spun off from the
company in the early years of the Civil War to
minimise financial damage stemming from the Ihatei
invasions. After successfully relocating to Glisten in
1123, the company struggled to survive financially,
though it managed to acquire industrial plant of its
own.  With generous financial assistance from an
unknown backer, GD bought out the remaining assets of
its now dead parent company, and concentrated its
assets heavily in the now peaceful Thinrim. GD's
primary focus is shipbuilding, though other
transportation products and space construction have
grown into major divisions in the last 70 years as
well.  The core of its strength is technical
innovation, and the continuance of GsBAGs high quality
engineering. Grand Design is still headquartered on
Glisten, and owns yards there, Neumann (the largest in
the Thinrim), Collace, Albe, Perrior (military
production only), Tobia, Colony Five (exclusive
ownership), Magash, Vincennes and Liiri.
<P>
<B>Grudovo Pendant:</B> Jump 1 route conneting 13 worlds in
Tobia/Trojan Reach and Usher/Reft. Once a remote
backwater, the region has become of utmost importance
to the burgeoning trade between the Denebian Frontier
and the Aslan Interface.


<B>Halka:</B> Albino human race native to Halka/Menorial (TR
0510).  The Halkans are not true
albinos, and their adaptations seem to be the result
of natural adaptation to their bright M9III star
rather than deliberate engineering by the Ancients. As
a people they were peaceful, a preferred a pastoral
existence.
<P>
The Florians contacted the world in 211, and quickly
subjugated the inhabitants.  The original Barnai
rulers took the simple lifestyle of their new subjects
as a sign of inferiority, and employed them as slave
labor. This practice continued for some time after the
world was absorbed into the Florian League, and only
ended after a public outcry in the 900s. Emancipation
landed most Halkans into destitution, and most
remained as tenant farmers for their former landlords.
<P>
<B>Huiha:</B> The Aslan term for Clan. It is headed by a
Fouheh, which is the lowest ranking "person" who may
be represented upon the Tlaukhu or any equivalent
political assembly, according to Aslan law.
<P>
<B>Khai':</B> Aslan name for their unified Quarantine Force.
The Khai' is unprecedented in being the first force ot
institution in the Aslan Hierate to transcend clan
boundaries. The force is equipped and staffed by a tax
levied upon all member clans in the Hierate, who
contribute according to their ability to do so, to a
common pool from which the force is organised and
assembled. Because Virus is a common threat, parochial
concerns of clan and pride are meaningless.  When an
Aslan joins the force, he or she is expected to leave
behind these trivial considerations, and serve the
Hierate and the Khai' without reservation.  Like the
Regency Quarantine Service, the Khai' utilises
gunships and small craft of specialised construction,
and are charged with the inspection of all interface
trade moving into the Hierate.

<P>

<B>Liberation Armies:</B> Modern day descendants of the Civil
War era resistance and "self defense" groups that
proliferated on DoD worlds captured by Aslan Ihatei.
Many world governments crumpled during the invasions,
or were tainted by collaboration, and local resistance
chapters often became the basis for Post-Collapse
governments on a number of Thinrim worlds. When the
Representational Reforms were announced, in most cases
the subsequent referenda confirmed the popularity of
these governments. But when the Regency, bowing to
necessity and the demands of their Fait Accompli
landlords, withdrew those worlds from the purview of
the Reforms, it ignited a firestorm of popular
controversy.  As local popular opinion on "free soil"
<P>
<B>Liberation Riots:</B> Intercommunal warfare that erupted
on several Thinrim worlds in the period of 1155-1164.
The riots were a spontaneous event, following the
inability of populations on Fait Accompli worlds to
obtain the right to participate in the
Representational Reforms, and the Regency's refusal to
extend the reforms to such worlds without the consent
of their Vargr and Aslan overlords.  Popular anger
escalated into an open revolt on Fait Accompli worlds,
and several neighboring systems as well. Many Thinrim
worlds still had strong feelings and memories about
resistance to the Aslan occupiers during the Civil War
period, and the flagging Self Defense movement was
revived as entire human populations were radicalised.
<P>

The revolt took the Aslan entirely by surprise, and
they were slow to respond with their forces. Large
sections of several of their worlds fell to rebels
armed by militias on nearby "free soil worlds", and
several human world military forces engaged in raiding
and infiltration operations of their own in an attempt
to aid their brethren.  Riots eventually consumed
integrated Aslan and human communities on worlds like
Gazulin and Peridot, and the Regency and Hierate
threatened war against each other. In the end the
threat of Virus, and the lack of Regency government
sanction, slowly turned the tide against the rebels.
Improved Aslan military units like the Steikhiy
crushed each center or resistance, one by one. And the
local populations burned themselves out on armed
resistance.
<P>


<B>Murissi:</B> Human minor race native to Atuakhtea (Hlakhoi
2008).  Atuakhtea is a world with a very eccentric
orbit, and the planet undergoes severe climactic
shifts. The Murissi were engineered for these shifts,
and the very dry conditions of the worlds deserts.
Their skin consists of hardened, overlapping plates or
scales, about half a centimeter in length, that cover
the body from head to toe. These plates both protect
the individual from sand and dirt, and provide a
cooling and heating mechanism. This body armor, and
pronounced foreheads and oversized smiles make them
macabre in appearance to most other humans that
encounter them, who often refer to them as"Skeletors."
Adult Murissi develop oversized fingernails intended
by their masters for burrowing and excavation work.
<P>
Murissi are reknowned for their almost inhuman
patience.  Time moves very slowly for this long lived
(300-350 standard years) subspecies.  Sexual maturity
comes late to them, and their birthrate is
imperceptible. Projects and career advancement can
take centuries.  Their high endurance permits them to
go without sleep for periods of up to five or six
normal days, without sign of adverse fatigue.  Most
cultural encounters can take days to complete, and
their slow pace can madden most offworld visitors.
<P>
Most Murissi congregated in small nomadic tribes that
wandered the world, after the Final War, looking for
food and water.  In spite of their nomadic
primitivism, they developed a complicated culture
based upon an advanced system of written and
pictographic representation.  The various tribes hold
a large impact spike (created by Ancient bombardment)
as their holy lands, and kept their holy and sacred
texts and law books here for safekeeping. Every
fifteen years a caretaker tribe was chosen to inhabit
the "speaking mountain", protect and maintain the
books, and to "speak" for the sacred lawgivers hidden
in the depths of the planet that dispensed these laws.
Envoys from the Speakers have their "skin" dyed in
gaudy colors, and touching or molesting them is
punishable by death, even though they often act
imperiously or bizarrely as dictated through their
duties. At the end of the fifteen years, the caretaker
tribe executes its oldest and senior members, destroys
most of its possessions, and is driven into exile for
another fifteen year period, and are subjected to
ritual humiliation and penitence by the other tribes
for its duration.
<P>
The race was contacted by Aslan of the Tralyeaeawi
clan around -740, and willingly submitted to their
control. The Murissi's legendary patience, and mastery
of abstract information made them in high demand by
female members of the clan looking for non-Aslan to
assist them in business and economic affairs. As a
result most members of the race were regarded as
female by other Aslan they encountered, though this
did not seem to worry them. When the Collapse reached
their part of Hierate around late 1131, a sizeable
part of the population fled Vampire Fleets then
rampaging in Hlakhoi, and made their way across the
Rift to the Colonies. The local Tralyeaeawi lords
refused to recognise their bonds of fealty, and they
were refused haven within their territories. Angered
by such dishonor, and recognising the usefulness of an
alliance, the Khaukheairl clan granted them sanctuary
in their territories. Murissi are now heavily
concentrated among "female" jobs in the clan, and are
heavily encountered by human merchants and diplomats.



<P>

<B>Naval Pathfinders:</B> The elite scouting and
reconaissance arm of the Regency Navy. With the demise
of RISS' external role at securing and protecting the
Regency from attack, and the subsequent
disestablishment of the Scout's Exploration Office, a
vulnerability developed in a vital area. Over the last
seventy years, the Pathfinders have become, along with
their dirtside equivalents, the Echelon teams, the
main early warning system for the Regency Safe and its
guardians.  Pathfinder units are seconded to mainline
naval forces during hostilities, but generally avoid a
direct role in combat except where it is warranted.
Most Pathfinder ships were surplus or retired scout
craft in the early years of the service, but have now
grown to include a wide array of specially designed
and constructed craft. Pathfinders are specialists in
covert insertion and infiltration, and many of their
pilots are used in covert operations in the Wilds,
including raids and extractions.

<P>

The Pathfinders are a specialised subordinate branch of Naval
Intelligence. Their primary duty is to maintain photo and electronic
surveillance, by manned missions or low profile remote platforms, of
critical areas of the Wilds.  They track Vampire activity, monitor
refueling activity at Wilds gas giants, assess the status of former
Imperial military facilities, and make contact with friendly groups
of sophonts.  They also maintain a running database of world data to
keep the government appraised of the political and cultural situation
in regions close to the Regency. Because of their experience in
traversing Virus infested areas, they are the pilots of choice for
covert missions and strike operations.
<P>
Dirtside operations, AKA the Echelon Teams, are Marines. For the
occasional contact of a friendly world in the Wilds a special team of
contact specialists from the Foreign Ministry is always maintained as
a part of the Pathfinders TO&E.


<P>
<B>New Lords:</B> Titles taken by Liberation leaders after
the Liberation Riots.  A deliberate play upon the
"Lakh Aorlakht" title used by Ihatei leaders during
the Civil War period.  Like so many other aspects of
the Thinrims "liberty" culture, this act of copying
and adaptation is a very human attempt at registering
defiance towards their Aslan neighbors or overlords.
Unfortunately it is insulting to the honor bound
Aslan, who find it especially grating in the protocol
bound chambers of the Regency Senate, where fellow
human senators from their subsectors demand that they
also be addressed according to Aslan traditions.
<P>
<B>New Model Military Architecture:</B> The general program
to research, design, construct and supply ships,
vehicles, weapons and equipment suitable for a Regency
reconquest of the former Imperium.  This requires a
radical departure from standard Imperial military
doctrines and strategies. The Regency has two severe
limitations on its projection of force into the Wilds:</B>
low force density and logistical/communication
constraints.  Even though the Regency Navy is several
times larger than its Civil War Domain predecessor,
and will grow larger still over the next fifteen
years, economic and logistical contraints will give it
a force density barely one-quarter to one-fifth that
of the entire Imperial Navy.  In addition these forces
will have to operate for a long time away from large
accumulations of munitions or spare parts, and without
the luxury of an extensive courier system for early
warning of Viral counterattacks.
<P>
In response to these demands, Regency military
designers have had to reverse long standing practices.
"Reconquista" forces have to be small and agile, and
capable of being resupplied by depot ships rather than
fixed resupply bases. Naval forces will have to
emphasize small ships, with destroyers and lighter
cruisers becoming the heaviest patrol units,
supplemented and reinforced at critical vantage points
by heavy line units, which are designed and equipped
for extended operations of up to six months without
relief or resupply.  Ground Units will have to operate
in most cases with a smaller number of more capable
armored vehicles and support weapons, and battle
armored infantry will be in many cases the primary
vanguard. Planners are anticipating few pitched
battles, and more guerilla and police actions, and
battlefields with no defined front, rear or flanks.
Missle armaments will have to be deemphasized, energy
weapons limited. Diplomacy and show of force
operations will be as important as normal battles.
<P>
The Regency has understood that the most important
part of any military expansion into the Wilds is its
ability to reassert the rule of law and order over the
TEDs and other disparate factions.  The NMMA forces
are quasi-police units intended to remove the worst
threats, whether viral or human, in favor or restoring
the means for interstellar commerce and planetary
redevelopment.  This force has no charter to restore
the Third Imperium, or to assert Regency sovereignty
in planetary or regional affairs.
<P>
<P>
<B>Nightwatch Alliance:</B> State of Free Association
maintained by the Regency of Deneb. The NA comprises,
in theory, formerly non-aligned worlds in the Great
Reft portions of Reft and Trojan Reach Sectors. In
reality it comprises the six Rift worlds of Tisilli,
Gikarlum, Villane, Browne, Sarage and Auitawry, all
located in Trojan Reach. The Nightwatch worlds retain
their local autonomy, but are subjected to the
authority of the Regency Rift Office for interstellar
operations of their planetary militaries, foreign
affairs and petitions to the Regency government.
<P>
<B>Otaioekh:</B> Former Aslan megacorp. Otaioekh was the
primary conduit of Aslan ihatei across the Great Rift
in antebellum times.  Most of the colony ships that
carried ihatei contingents were operated or leased out
by the company in exchange for a cut of the profits
from new colonial ventures. The Hierate portion of the
company was primarily a construction firm,
manufacturing alternative habitats to accomodate the
growing population.  After the Collapse the surviving
portion of the company congregated in Aslan colonies
close to the Regency and the Borderland, and it has
extensive commercial contacts with Regency corps and
governments in the Thinrim.
<P>
<B>Otritsyu'a:</B> Droyne for "killing between communities."
The Droyne concept of total war.  In wars involving
aliens or implacable enemies, Droyne forces will relax
the ritualised constraints of limited war required of
them for fighting within a community or with other
Oytrips. When Otritsyu'a is invoked, a Droyne
community will not stop fighting until it or its
enemies have been absolutely defeated.  In the face of
such relentless devotion to battle, even Aslan
warriors have been known to wilt.

<B>Prophets of Geynim:</B> Cruel, xenophobic cult native to
Scaladon/Tobia (TR 2616). The origins of this cult
have been lost to the mists of time. They were already
established on this strange and deadly world when the
Imperium contacted them in 341.  Normally they are
hostile and aggressive to intruders, and secretive of
their habits and beliefs.  But defectors and refugees
that left en masse during the 1150s and 60s have
filled in Regency authorities on some of the cults
beliefs.
<P>
The Geynimites worship a god named Geynim, who either
lives or is trapped in the depths of their world's
wilderness and its crushing atmosphere.  Geynim did
not create the universe, but did create all of the
sentient species, and brought them the gift of
knowledge.  A group of very ancient races ascended to
enormous heights of technological command and
scientific ingenuity, but they soon chafed at Geynim's
rule, and grew jealous of his power. Several of them
ambushed and seized the god, and trapped it in an
inescapable prison; but their victory was pyrrhic, as
Geynim used the last of its power to do irreperable
damage to them and their societies, until they faded
into obscurity. The Geynimites teach that this god
contacted them, offering enlightenment in return for
their assistance at freeing them from its prison, and
restoring its honor.
<P>
Supposedly for almost two thousand years the
Geynimites have labored through bizarre and graphic
rituals to free their "god" from its hiding place,
often reverting to brutality in order to accomplish
it. Most rituals consist of force marches in ritual
circles, psionic "conciousness" raising with the
assistance of extreme states of pain and privation,
and even rumors of human sacrifice.  The self
destructive manner of this cult finally exhausted the
patience of a good portion of its believers, who used
the Escape Clause to emigrate to Tobia or Gazulin.
Rumored "Lost Books" containing the technical lore of
the alledged "Elder Races" have been a long time part
of Thinrim lore for centuries, and inspired Frederick
Midashi's creation of Prismodyn and God's Portal.
<P>
<B>Prismodyn:</B> "Midas' Kingdom." First company founded by
Frederick Midashi, and the source of his enormous
wealth. Prismodyn is a cutting edge manufacturer of
industrial and communication equipment, headquartered
on Albe/Sindal.  Prismodyn was constructed to carry
out "alchemical" research, by the use of high energy
particle accelerators, nuclear dampers and primitive
disintegrators, in creating the protomatter that
Midashi claimed existed in the tablets he called the
"Codices of the Elder Races." Despite public ridicule,
this commercial venture proved to be highly
successful. But despite his spectacular scientific
"success", his appetites for sex and money caused
controversy among his shareholders and Regency
authorities. And the scientific community was starting
to sniff at his results and claiming that his
"miracles" were bogus if not downright fraudulent.
These events led to his first disappearance, after
faking his own assassination by a hireling in 1147.
<P>
<B>Spector Ironworks:</B> Small shipbuilding company
headquartered on Glisten. Spector has a strong
presence in the Thinrim, with facilities at
Perrior/Pax Rulin, Glisten/Glisten and Doradon/Pax
Rulin, and these yards build primarily for export to
the Aslan Hierate.  Outside of the Thinrim the company
produces mostly small, low tech starships for the
budget market, mostly in clusters of j-1 worlds in
Deneb. These yards are small facilities located on
lightly populated worlds:</B> Dawn/Zeng,
Achemadon/Vincennes, Imone/Star Lane, Karst/Namidshur,
Kirklend/Pretoria and Berg/Tobia.
<P>


<B>Reastirlao:</B> Former Aslan megacorporation.  Owned
entirely by the Tralyeaeawi clan. In antebellum times
the corporation concentrated upon shipping and trade,
but also possessed a large industrial base in sectors
adjacent to the Great Rift.  Since the Collapse, the
surviving portion of the company has continued to rely
upon shipping as its main source of income.  The
company has some presence in the Regency, acting as
the primary shipping company between Fait Accompli
worlds.
<P>
<B>Regency Intelligence Service:</B> The division of the
Regency Foreign Ministry charged with intelligence
gathering and espionage operations against Non-Viral
adversaries.  Perhaps the term "general information"
gathering would be more appropriate. In the aftermath
of the Collapse, the war against Virus monopolised
most of the intelligence assets of the Regency
military. Which was all fine and well, as the army and
navy had proven largely ineffective against the
Zhodani and in operations among the Vargr and Human
client states. RIS is a "gentlemans" organisation, for
unlike most spy services, it thrives by being open
about some of its operations.
<P>
RIS has four main branches:  Contact and Monitoring,
Operations, Communications, and Administration and
Support. C&M is based in part upon SolSec's monitors;
RIS recruits all manner of so called overt or open
source intelligence contacts, generally people like
traders and academics who have information about the
goings on inside a particular region or country.
Unlike secret espionage, this network is fully
acknowleged by the Regency, and in many cases these
contact sources work for the other side as well,
creating an unofficial diplomatic pipeline used by
several nations. Communications are the couriers and
secret/overt carriers of gathered intelligence.
Operations is your standard issue espionage and spying
officers. And A&S handles logistics and normal
bureaucratic functions.

<P>
<B>Salika:</B> Mammalian species originally native to
Garden/Alone (Reft 0435). The Salika are short,
bilaterally symetrical bipeds with 2 arms. They are
covered in short, fine fur that lies flat like a
seal's. Their hands are  long-fingered
with more webbing and with more joints than a human
hand.
<P>
Some parts of their speech occur at pitches too high
for human or Aslan hearing. Salika are friendly and
tolerant, and have little tendency to violence or
combat. When they find it necessary to fight to settle
a dispute, they always fight bare-handed until the
submission of one combatant. Salika enjoy gambling for
pleasure, and they have a healthy appetite for both
intellectual and athletic diversions.
<P>
The species originally developed from a seal-like
acquatic species. In their presentient phase,
the Salika were repeatedly driven to the sea for
survival as their land habitats dried up in the heat.
In ice ages that followed, most of the world's
lifeforms gathered near the equator.  As a result the
Salika have a physiology best adapted to a cool
temperate climate and  underwater. the Salika can dive
deep and work underwater for long periods. They came
to sentience during one of the longest ice ages.
<P>
As their population and industrial base increased, the
need for land and resources buried under the glaciers
became acute. Garden has a highly variable star, and
this creates alternating spells of intensely hot and
glacial climate as a result. After attaining a TL of
11 (though not jump drive) the Salika leadership
successfully warmed the then bitterly cold atmosphere
by injecting CO2 into the atmosphere. Because of blind
spots in their science,  their lack of understanding
about the star's cycles nearly doomed them when the
next bright phase began around 970.  Faced with
extinction on their homeworld, the race constructed
several massive generation ships, and scattered into
the unknown.  The ships occasionally contacted each
other via radio beacons, but around 1050 an unknown
catastrophe had claimed most of the ships, and only a
handful made it out of the Rift.
<P>
One of these made it <a href="../opal/opal8800.html">Ahfatre</A> (Riftspan Reaches 2219)
and was contacted by the crew and passengers of an
Aslan merchant ship in 1120.  After negotiations with
local clans, the survivors were permitted to settle
Aufusyah (Riftspan 1716) under Tlaukhu supervision.
The Aslan were delighted with their new subjects, and
their world was spared the influx of incoming Ihatei
and refugees fleeing the Collapse.  Two other
generation ships have since been found:</B> one near
Browne (TR 3030) and another in Verge sector; both of
these were evacuated and their populations relocated
to Aufusyah.
<P>

<B>Self Defense Forces:</B> Guerilla forces that fought the
Ihatei invaders of Trojan Reach during the Imperial
Civil War. When the DoD abandoned several worlds in
the Reach during the Civil War period, these forces
often filled the void. Some of these were the local
planetary militaries resisting the initial Ihatei
advances, but most were created by human populations
after the fall of their worlds, and the imposition of
repressive Aslan laws and customs.  Few of these
forces had much direct effect upon defeating the Aslan
advance, though it did slow and seriously hurt it.
Many self defense forces disbanded after the Regency
reclaimed the fallen worlds in 1131-1132, but
stockpiled their arms for future contingencies. Many
of these hidden arsenals were tapped during the
Liberation Riots, and were instrumental in the
creation of the Liberation Armies, many of whom were
commanded and organised by SDF veterans.
<P>
<B>Senlis Foederate:</B> Former interstellar state located in
Pax Rulin Subsector (Trojan Reach C). The Foederate
was an aggressive and expansionistic state dedicated
to the exploitation of several nearby worlds for the
benefit of the mainworld of Senlis. Its colonies were
restive and almost rebellious, and were held in check
only by mercenary soldiers and economic dependence.
The Foederate was invaded by Aslan forces in 1119-20,
and was quickly conquered.
<P>
<B>Steikhiy:</B> The joint internal security forces of the
Fait Accompli Aslan worlds. Stung by the poor
performance and belated reactions of their Trekhyair
during the Liberation Riots, the Regency based clans
pooled their resources, and constructed a military
force that is remarkably similar to Regency
peacekeeping and special operations forces in
organisation and training. The Steikhiy is an unusual
departure for another reason:</B> it is an all volunteer
force of Aslan troops acting as a permanent
professional force.  It has been the brutal yet
effective tactics of this force that has rolled back
the gains created by human guerilla forces, and
deterred wider attacks by Liberation Armies on other
Thinrim forces, and not the dilatory efforts of the
Regency Peacekeeping Forces. Indeed the presence of
this force has been a major reason for intensifying
Aslan disdain for the Regency, not only for its
effectiveness, but also because of the growing
acculturation into the Regency mainstream that it
represents not only for the Fait Accompli, but the
entire surviving Hierate.
<P>
<B>Sternmetal Horizons:</B> Former Imperial Megacorp. The
survival of Sternmetal (German for "Star Metal") is
something of a fluke in of itself. SH had been
assimilated, thanks to clever manipulation, into the
giant "survival cartel" orchestrated by Hortalez et
Cie. But because of the Domain of Deneb's isolation
from the main offices, and because of thorny legal
issues, most of Sternmetal's subsidiaries Behind the
Claw had not yet been incorporated or transferred to
Hortalez when Virus was released. Most of the local
offices simply shrugged off the financial effects of
the Collapse, and continued with business with few ill
effects.  The scandal plagued company had more
problems with accepting the ultimate authority of the
new Regency government, which led to a legal crackdown
on executive malfeasance that gutted the companies
upper management ranks. Since then, Sternmetal has had
a schizophrenic existence, studiously upholding the
law in its Regency operations, while backsliding into
the worst of its Imperial era practices in the Hinters
and the Zhodani Shadow.
<P>
In the Regency the company goes by the name
"Horizons." Mining operations make up a minor portion
of the Regency part of the company; instead it has
concentrated on manufacturing power systems, armaments
and virus-resistant automation in information systems.
The company has expanded its operations in the
Thinrim, and nearly half of its Regency industry and
operations are located on Glisten, Neumann and Tobia.
Outside of the Regency it has concentrated upon
mineral exploration, extraction and processing; it has
become the largest mining company in the Spinward
Hinters. Cutthroat competition from other companies in
the Hinters has compelled it to use military means of
survival, and it is a heavy employer of mercenary
forces.
<P>
Sternmetal Deneb is headquartered on Rhylanor, but
considerable leeway is granted to subsector managers.
Outside of the Regency the company defers authority to
"subsidiary" councils located at various intervals
around the Hinters, like Syl (Foreven 2724).
Sternmetal operations outside of the Regency are
always heavily protected by mercenary forces, and are
to be approached cautiously, with no indication of
aggression.
<P>
<B>Swords of Vengeance:</B> Main Sword Worlds terrorist and
guerilla organisation. Otherwise known as the
Deathriders. Group takes its name from the cruiser of
the legendary Baron Van Kreden, which was destroyed in
1114 over Mora. The Swords have not been a very
effective or cohesive organisation, but its
intelligence and sabotage teams have ranged all over
the Regency in the name of Sword World Independence.
Some of these ranging units have assisted Thinrim
Liberation Armies in the past, though mostly in a
hamhanded attempt to link the two causes together
despite their massive differences.  This has created a
funnel for illegal arms from Narsil through Collace
and Glisten.
<P>



<P>
<B>Tezcat:</B> Minor Race native to Gidiir/Two Little (Reft
1907).  The Tezcat are a warmblooded, upright bipedal
carnivore. They smaller and shorter than humans, but
come equipped with a flexible tail, and higher
metabolism. Their four fingered hands end in sharp
claws, and their front fangs contain a neurotoxin
lethal to small oxygen breathing animals, though it
will only sicken an adult human.
<P>
Tezcat tend to form small polygamous family groups
that also act as the primary political and economic
unit of their society. They are remarkably gregarious,
and violence between Tezcat is almost unheard of. A
pleasure loving species, and prefer to live for the
moment. Tezcat are xenophobic, though its degree is
limited by the amount of percieved differences that
exists between them and an encountered species. A
bipedal humanoid like humans and Aslan are close
enough to be tolerated; Droyne, K'kree and Hivers are
likely to be attacked.
<P>
The Tezcat are governed by an unusual set of religious
traditions that tend to mirror their hedonism with a
peculiar brand of nihilism that makes them fatalistic
and obsessive. Most notable is their Shaper cult,
which worships a void filling god known as the Shaper.
 Places of darkness and vacuum are the natural
domicile of this diety, and black holes are often
venerated as being doorways into its lair.
Transmigration is an alien custom to the religion, and
the dead are ritually eaten by relatives and friends
to ensure that the souls and essence of the deceased
are preserved by the community.
<P>
The Tezcat evolved in the dense forests of their
homeworlds around 40,000 years ago, and developed
slowly into a civilised species. They eventually
reached the equivalent of TL-10 on their own.  About
1000 years ago Droyne explorers from nearby Zamoran
(Reft 2108) contacted the world, and were ambushed by
Tezcat repelled at the aliens appearance. A rescue
expedition was also attacked and wiped out, and war
was declared by the Tezcat on the Droyne. The jump
drives of both missions were salvaged and copied, and
in a few years Tezcat warships began raiding Zamoran.
As their intensity increased to the point of genocide,
the Oytrip of Zamoran declared Otritsyu'a, and
annihilated a good portion of the Tezcat and their
civilization.
<P>
The survivors were driven into the wilderness by
vengeful Droyne troops, and subsisted with stone age
technology. Eventually most memory of the holocaust
was forgotten by the emerging tribes, memorialised
only by the surviving Shaper priests.  Human colonists
arrived from Deneb sector in 964, and recontacted the
aliens. Despite some early unpleasantness with the
locals, the mostly Vilani colonists eventually won
over the survivors, and helped uplift them as they
constructed their own colonies.  Cultural gaps remain,
and the two communties are essentially seperate
nations.
<P>
<B>Tobia Main:</B> Jump 1 main connecting 15 worlds in Tobia
subsector. Severe disruptions of the local populations
by the Ihatei invasions of the Civil War, Fteirle
refugees and the Representational Reforms are quite
evident here.  On many worlds, these dislocations have
left populations that are not hesitant about taking
preemptive action in circumstances where they feel
threatened or abused.
<P>
<B>Trekhyair:</B> Literally the "Land Defenders." The local
defense forces of an Aslan landhold or clan. Unlike
human military forces, which are often professional in
nature, Trekhyair composition varies widely between
clans, comprising well equipped professional soldiers
down to poorly equipped peasant levies. The diffuse
nature of these forces have left the Aslan poorly
prepared for military operations against the human
guerillas, and this led to the creation of the
Steikhiy, an elite interclan military force.
<P>
<B>Volks-Kruez:</B> Small shipbuilder, formerly of the
Federation of Arden. VK was originally the proprietor
of Tremous Dex/Vilis, but defected to the Regency in
the wake of the Quarantine. After selling its yards
and facilities to the Regency Navy, the company
relocated to the Thinrim.  While its product line is
small compared to LSP or Grand Design, its designs
include the highly successful <I>Scorpion</I>-class 300 ton
utility ship, a modular design that can quickly
convert between military and civilian roles; the
<I>Grimlock</I> 6000 ton "Self Protecting Destroyer", a
frigate sized vessel with a squadron of gunships, and
the <I>Nunex</I> class 600 ton corvette. The TL-15 <I>Scorpion</I>
is a standard design in the Navy and RQS, and is the
vessel most frequently encountered in the ready and
inactive reserve forces. It has been the high demand
for the <I>Scorpion</I> that has permitted Volks-Kreuz
remarkable growth. The <I>Grimlock</I> and <I>Nunex</I> are TL-13,
and are marketed for planetary navies or export to the
Spinward Hinters. Volks-Kruez is headquartered on
Neumann, and has yards on Collace, Glisten, Albe,
Neumann itself, Hradus, Elixir and Catacomb.

<B>Wyaroaer:</B> Aslan megacorp that flourishes in non-Aslan
markets. Nominally under the control of the Eakhitiyo,
in reality the company's operations are actually
independent of the main clan council.  The company is
a
major stakeholder in the Hierate's arms industry, from
starship weapons and military vehicles, to custom made
guns and blades finished in the traditional Aslan
style.  Most of its management in the Regency is a
mixture of Aslan and Humans. The relaxed scrutiny
allows the company to hire male "other" Aslan for
management and consulting positions without ruffling
fur back at home.
