<HR>
<P>
This is more of a general
background overview of the TNE universe at it applies
to my campaign. Since Traveller was first introduced
in the 1970s, a revolution in technology, institutions
and even culture has occured in the real world that
has increasingly relegated it to the category of the
"Future that might have been." Part of the following
data is an attempt to update Traveller into the
framework of the first few years of the new millenia.
Much of this reflects advances in information
technology, cosmology, particle physics and biology,
and their implications for the humanities.
<P>
<B>Acupuncture Doctrine:</B>  Also known as the "Leyline"
theory. The core of the doctrine is a reflection of
the increasing complexity of science and engineering.
Brute force becomes less important than precision
strike or discrete manipulation at critical points
within the system. Conversely this also makes complex
integrated societies more vulnerable to "holistic"
threats. Weaponry become less important for its
visibility than for its effectiveness; military
systems depend more upon dispersion and precision than
mass. The AI Virus is a good example of such
disruptive armament systems.
<P>
<B>AI Virus:</B>  Inorganic sentient lifeform native to
Cymbeline/Arcturus, that was collected and adapted by
the Third Imperium into a deadly biological weapon.
<P>
Virus evolved from the Imperium's adaptation of the
original "chip" into the SDG-313A tamperproof
transponder.  The idea of this development was to
create a low lethality disruption system that would
permit the Imperium to neutralise the military
capabilities of a domestic enemy without having to
revert to the increasingly destructive methods of the
Imperial Marines. Accordingly, most Imperial military
systems manufactured after 1100 came equipped with
"kill switches" that would permit their deactivation
with the proper virus.
<P>
Unfortunately, the original system proved too mutable
and uncontrollable for deployment, and had been
delayed for nearly a decade when the Imperial Civil
War erupted.  The inability of the Imperial military
to control it was compounded by the destructiveness of
the war, which compelled the combatants to fall back
on cheaper lower tech equipment such as silicon based
computer systems, to replace higher tech systems they
could no longer maintain or replace. Had virus been
released in 1117, damage would have been minimal and
the infection would have been localised, but by 1127
the combatants had inadvertently increased the
available "ecosystem" for Virus by an exponential
degree. For many high tech worlds that had depended
upon massive integration for survival, their carefully
designed information networks were now unwieldly
patchworks of jury-rigged silicon and more advanced
systems that were extremely vulnerable to disruption
of the kind that Virus represented.
<P>
The release of Virus is thought to be due to the
hamhanded actions of Dulinor's Coronation Fleet, which
invaded Core's Research Station Omicron in an effort
to retreive it for their own attempt at a complete
victory. The fleet lost more than a third of its
surviving complement to the virus, and the remainder
spread the infection across the Imperial Core when
they retreated back to the Federation of Ilelish.
Fortunately for the Spinward Extents, Strephon had
been carefully monitoring the situation in the Core,
and had anticpated, based upon his own information,
Dulinor's next move. To that end the emperor sent
advance warning and critical technical information on
the virus project to Archduke Norris the moment that
he heard of Dulinor's departure for Capitol. That
foresight saved the region Behind the Claw, as a joint
Domain of Deneb/Aslan task force used the warning to
intercept the massive wave of viral infected ships
that moved across the Verge Connector and attempted to
enter the region through the Aslan colonies.
<P>
The term "Virus" is actually a misnomer. Unlike a real
virus, the AI Virus does not have to contact its
intended target directly. Rather it uses an EMP of
discrete and carefully released energy to overwrite
the operating systems and hardware of its target
system with its own "genetic" code, or at least a
variation of it.  Given that it bestows sentient life
upon dead technological systems, and the fact that a
"genetic code" is not a blueprint so much as a dynamic
conjugal system, then the AI Virus method of
propagation is more akin to alchemy than to biology.
Its proper nomenclature should be AI "Animus" instead.

<P>
<B>Ancients:</B>  Mysterious alien race of stunning power and
technological advancement. The race apparently was
native to the Spinward Marches, and arose to
prominence about 300,000 years ago. In their brief
reign, the Ancients attained technological mastery
unlike anything ever seen before or since within our
galaxy, with the possible exception of the even more
mysterious Primordials.  The Ancients created massive
engineering projects that bended worlds and
ecosystems, and was responsible for the diaspora of
humans from ancient Terra and the creation of the
Vargr.
<P>
For centuries the Ancients were shrouded in scientific
controversy. While the scientific consensus accepted
that they were related to the Droyne, no other theory
could explain their eccentric tendency to reinvent
technology (no two Ancient sites are alike), nor their
ultimate fate in the Final War. Since the advent of
Virus, an uncomfortable comparison has been made
between the manic tendencies of the Ancients, and the
similiar pathology of Hobbyist strain viruses. On the
basis of that comparison, several theories have
emerged to state that they were, in fact, a mutant
strain of Droyne with great intelligence and a
peculiar obsessive compulsive drive. In this day and
age of increasing cynicism, this demystification of
the Ancients has contributed to the contemporary sense
that there are no heroes in existence.
<P>
<B>Askigaak Devolution:</B>  The pending abandonment of
Askigaak/Star Lane (Deneb 0629 UPP:</B>  B549BA8-E), by a
major percentage of its population. Askigaak is a
primarily Vilani culture world (albeit with a
primarily Solomani population), settled early in the
Third Imperial period. It is a frigid water world
whose land is primarily seamounts and archipelagoes
that jut above the icepacks of the temperate
latitudes. Most of the population has lived in
sprawling underwater arcologies, often in very
miserable conditions. The Industrial Development
Program raised its tech level from 12 to 14, and
improved offworld access considerably. But since 1117,
the population has increased to an unsustainable 123
billion people, compounded in large part by the IDP's
instigation of massive industrial development.
<P>
A survey made in 1184 indicated that the world's
meager ecosystem was near failure due to the massive
stress created by such a massive population. Moreover
the increasing number of people made very heavy
casualties likely on such an earthquake prone world.
After negotiations between Regent Seldrian, the
subsector governor and the Askigaak government, a plan
was drawn up that would evacuate about eighty to
eighty five percent of the population to other nearby
worlds.  Several less well populated worlds were
approached with the offer of hosting at least a
portion of Askigaak's displaced population in return
for monetary aid and high population status.
<P>
To date only three of her Star Lane neighbors have
agreed to begin accepting displaced persons in the
next decade:</B>  Azizyah (Deneb 0229), Rimkuku (Deneb
0228, which was contingent upon terraforming) and
Kemal (Deneb 0626). Negotiations with Norg (Deneb
0729) and Imone (Deneb 0826) are ongoing.  Azizyah
will be the big winner, having agreed to accept nearly
25 billion people. The amount of the compensation
package accepted by Azizyah's population is still
confidential, but is rumored to be quite massive.
<P>
(And yes, I have worked out the numbers. It is
possible given a sixty to one hundred year time
frame.)
<P>
<B>Aslan Colonies:</B>  Regions of the Aslan Hierate that were
settled on the opposite side of the Great Rift. The
Colonies were first settled about a thousand years
ago, after the Aslan had perfected jump 5 drives that
permitted their colony ships to cross through Riftspan
Reaches. The Colonies were never a mainstream part of
the Hierate, and were often seen as dumping grounds
for unwanted ihatei or other undesirable elements. Its
proximity to the Domain of Deneb portion of the Third
Imperium permitted great trade oppurtunities, but for
the most part the region was a safety valve backwater
for the young and foolish.
<P>
With the outbreak of the Imperial Civil War, and the
isolation of the Domain of Deneb, the ihatei of
several Aslan clans in the Colonies invaded Imperial
held regions of the Spinward Marches, Trojan Reach and
Reft sectors. Their success was cause for both
celebration and irritation. A number of oppurtunistic
ihatei on the rimward side of the Rift crossed into
the Colonies in search of their own territories. But
at the same time it created a war with the DoD that
did not reflect well upon the tradition bound Aslan
culture, and represented the first clear breakdown of
the bounds of their cultural hegemony.
<P>
Viral infected ships crossing the Verge Connector
sealed the fate of the main body of the Hierate in
1131, and the Colonies narrowly averted a similiar
dire fate with DoD assistance.  The Colonies are now
the only part of the Aslan Hierate that is still
extant, a role for which they were poorly prepared.
In many regions the shock of the Collapse and Virus
fractured the few remaining ties of inter-Aslan unity
that had survived the earlier clan squabbling over the
DoD. Many ihatei lacked the skills and character to
act as supreme leaders for their their decimated
clans. Too many were simply too lackluster to begin
with, or were too glutted upon their conquests to even
try. The result is a nation that is outwardly
formidable, even monolithic, but has teetered on
increasingly sharp domestic divisions within.
<P>
<B>Asymmetrical Warfare:</B>  The Fourth Generation of
Warfare. This is warfare based less upon large,
hardware intensive weapons, and more upon the aptly
misnamed "low intensity" warfare idea. In Asymmetrical
Warfare, the idea of a spatial battlefield, where
state-run professional armies clash with massed heavy
hardware away from populated centers, is replaced by
dispersed combatants of a communal, religious or
ethnic nature in an urban or heavily populated
environment with lightly armed guerillas that enjoy
widespread popular support, or at least the passive
acquiesence of a local population. Quite simply, AW is
a reversion to tribal warfare, where everyone is a
potential combatant.
<P>
Asymmetrical Warfare has three main theaters:   urban
terrorism, popular or psychological conflict and
disruptive warfare. All of these rely upon small,
difficult to identify combatants who rely upon media,
timed attacks, concealment within or by a crowd,
guerilla tactics, and the use of weapons of mass
destruction, all within a primarily civilian or urban
battlefield.  These units generally have low
logistical requirements, and a loose network nature
into which combatants are loosely connected. The first
instance of asymmetrical warfare as the norm were the
wars of old Terra between 1985-2000 CE, which was
fought mostly with lightly armed police, and military
troops that fought like police.  In these kinds of
battlefields heavy hardware is less important than
good, solidly trained infantry equipped with a mixture
of battle dress and light body armor.
<P>
Since the destruction of the last major Vampire
incursion into Deneb Sector in 1171, fighting with
virus has taken on a more asymmetrical nature. Echelon
teams and larger Denebian incursions Wildside have
encountered more and more "streetfighter" battles
where Virus has fortified itself in cities or other
large settlements, and relies upon smart weapons and
human infantry auxiliaries to defend itself.
Fortunately, Regency Peacekeeping Forces have gained
wide experience in these tactics since their
formation, as a result of their operations against
Sword World guerillas, and their police expertise has
been adopted for a number of Assualt and Lift Infantry
Divisions for punitive operations against these kind
of strongholds. Given the nature of most so called
Technologically Elevated Dictators, and the forces
they possess, the Regency can expect many more battles
of this nature as it expands into the Wilds. Therefore
Asymmetrical Response is a major part of the forces
and doctrines being evolved under the New Model
Military Architecture.
<P>
(Also see http:</B> //www.comw.org/rma/)
<P>
<B>Battle Rider:</B>  A large cruiser or destroyer sized
warship that sacrifices jump drive ability for
increased endurance, armor or firepower.  Battle
Riders are always carried into battle by larger jump
capable vessels known as Battle Tenders.
Theoretically, a Rider is capable of defeating a jump
capable vessel of similiar size. In reality, this is
only the case under certain tactical circumstances. In
setpiece warfare, a force of Riders can be difficult
to defeat. But in the fluid warfare that has typified
operations against the Zhodani and Virus, Riders have
been a serious washout. Under current naval doctrine,
Riders are always used in the strategic defensive
role, fortifying
refuelling sources within the Regency Frontier, and
safeside worlds within a three parsec proximity of the
frontier interface..  Some Rider squadrons
are deployed into regions Wildside adjacent to the
Regency, along with a handful of Scapegoats, laying in
ambush of Vampire ships.
 <P>
<B>Blowback:</B>  Term used by intelligence organisations to
refer to the unintended consequences of their
operations. Usually blowback occurs when an agency
indulges in behavior that is considered illegal or
immoral within the contexts of either its own
controlling government or by the target of its
operations.  When an agent of a lawful government, in
the quest for expediency or advantage within the
already murky world of espionage, operates in such a
fashion, the result is usually a drastic if not
violent form of retaliation from the injured party in
either a legal manner, or in a ruthless manner
commensurate with the violation.
<P>
<B>Buzzard:</B>  A free trader or military unit who makes
their livelihood upon salvage from a cemetery world.
More pejoratively, it refers to those traders and
pirates, during the early years of the Collapse, who
followed the wavefront of Viral infection, waiting for
a world to collapse, permitting easy looting.
<P>
<B>Condotterie:</B>  Literally Italian for "contractor."
Corporate mercenary units, or any military unit that
is owned or backed by private money and support that
is inteneded for private hire for profit. Most
Imperial era mercenary units were of this nature, but
have become extinct in the Regency following the
Collapse. Condotterie units are a natural consequence
of the inability of mercs to handle both military
operations and the myriad bureaucratic sundries of
day-to-day operations.  The most famous (or infamous)
condotterie provider was the late Imperial megacorp
Instellarms, which controlled perhaps sixty percent of
the Third Imperium's private mercenary market.
Condotterie units are not highly regarded beyond their
utility; many larger corporate units were notable for
aiding and abetting the vacuous greed and questionable
methods of their employers.  Many units in the
Spinward Hinters and Zhodani Shadow are still
condotterie.
<P>
<B>Coronal Mass Ejection (CME):</B>  The common scientific
name for a solar flare. The magnetic fields that rise
from a star coincide and interact within the hot
"atmosphere" known as the Corona. These fields act
like a net, impeding the flow of solar heated plasma,
and causing a buildup of momentum within the corona
that usually escapes as the million degree heat most
planets in a solar system recieve as radiant energy.
However, the magnetic fields of a star periodically
fluctuate, sometimes dissipating enough that the
accumulated pressure within the Corona overcomes them,
and a solar flare event occurs.
<P>
Most stars have a periodic process of CME events. For
Terra's primary, Sol, this is an 11 year process, that
proceeds from a solar minimum of almost no activity,
to a solar maximum of very heavy activity. These
cycles have to do with the build up of magnetic fields
issuing from the solar core, and the longer the cycle,
the more violent the flare activity. These cycles are
typified by increases or decreases in sunspots within
the Corona, which signify the passage of the binding
magnetic fields within the Corona. Sunspots are not
directly responsible for CMEs, though large numbers of
spots are usually precursors of such an event,
indicating increasing magnetic interference that may
allow for pressure to be released.
<P>
A CME is almost always supercharged plasma, and can
mass up to a million metric tons. A flare can travel
up to a million miles (1.6 million kilometers) an
hour, taking about three to four days to reach a
typical T-Norm world at 1 AU.  Most flares are
generally too dissapated by the time they reach the
life zone to have much of an effect on a habitable
world possessing an ionosphere or magnetic field of
its own. However, planetary magnetic fields do not
cover the poles, and charged particles can enter the
atmosphere through these gaps, creating the
spectacular effects known as the Aurora Borealis and
Austrailis. Such events can severly disrupt the a
planet's ionosphere, impeding radio communications.
Stronger flares can disrupt high voltage electrical
currents, causing fluctuations that will burn out
transformers and monitoring equipment in satellites
and even ground based electrical grids.
<P>
The largest flare on record for a typical main
sequence star is the Maghiz flare in the
Daryen/Darrian system. This was a man-made flare
triggered by the passage of a probe through the corona
of Tanis, the local primary. The confluence of a metal
coolant ejected by the probe and a pair of meson
communicators caused a solid state fusion reaction in
the corona that in turn caused a near total collapse
of Tanis' entire magnetosphere. The resulting "kill
shot" flare had a mass of almost 35 BILLION tons, and
created an EMP that nearly destroyed the Darrian
civilisation, and disrupted nearby worlds.
<P>
<B>Corporate Rechartering/"Immaculation":</B>  The restoration
and reenfrancisement of pre-Collapse Imperial
corporations in the Regency.
<P>
Before the Regency engaged in the crackdown upon
surviving Imperial age corporations known as the
Corporate Twilight, the First Regent and his advisors
realised that using a stick without a carrot would do
more economic harm than political good. With the
Regency economy still smarting from the Civil War, and
now staggering from the Collapse, a series of legal
and economic inducements were offered to the same
corporations. Norris offered companies with existing
Imperial or Crown licenses to recharter themselves
under the new regime. The slate would be wiped clean,
and companies would be granted a fresh start, provided
that they held to the more stringent Regency laws
involving private commerce. In exchange, the Regency
would help underwrite a new Commercial and Credit Bank
that would assist surviving companies obtain new
finance, and a new stock exchange and selling service
to help raise money from the public.
<P>
This "Immaculation" raised a hue and cry from many
anti-corporate factions within the public. Many were
incensed that past misdeeds were being conveniently
forgotten in favor of economic expediency. However,
they underestimated Norris on this occasion; the
charters were under the auspicies of the Ministry of
Justice and its newly expanded Commercial Activities
and Environmental Enforcement divisions. Because state
money was being used as an inducement, the government
retained the right to examine company books to see if
the money was being reasonably spent. And because the
charters were given by the government, they could be
taken away, and companies were tracked for illegal
activity. In the end the entire system ran through the
final jurisprudence and organisation of Regency
commercial and district courts, which established both
statutary limits and precendential requirements.
<P>
While many corporations, particularly older megacorps,
had great difficulty at first in converting from
quasi-governmental viceroys to being merely profitable
private firms, the benefits of the Regency's reforms
far outweighed the loss of freedom. The elimination of
corporate malfeasance both enhanced corporate images,
and allowed management to concentrate more upon
profitability than politics. The confiscation of
private arsenals removed the burden of having to
divert money for military and espionage activities;
and the elimination of trade wars and their affiliated
mercenaries eliminated most of the corporate
insecurity that fed into their perpetuation.  In the
long run, the growing clout of private local stock
ownership became even more influential, domesticating
and bridling corporate managers to an even more
pernicious degree than Imperial aristocracy had ever
managed. Of course, this doesn't mean that things
improved outside of the Regency.......
<P>

<B>Corporate Twilight:</B>  The crackdown upon Imperial
corporate illegality and corruption by the Regency in
the aftermath of the Collapse. A new office was formed
in the Ministry of Justice, which had jurisdiction
over commercial and environmental prosecution.
Between 1132 and 1144, the new Commercial Crimes
Office, with a good deal of assistance from the
Regency Quarantine Service, did a nearly complete
sweep of megacorporate business hiearchies of corrupt
officials and illegal behavior.
<P>
<B>Delgado Trading:</B>  Former Imperial megacorporation still
in existence in the Regency and the Spinward States.
Delgado specialised in an odd trifecta of publishing,
mining and minaturisation. Since the Collapse, the
surviving parts of company has sold or spun off all of
its publishing wing, and expanded into new
nanotechnology and micromanufacturing industries.
Whereas many Imperial era corps have stagnated in the
face of new local competition and more stringent
Regency regulation, Delgado has forged ahead in
research and development, and has been a leader in
microengineering and Viral countermeasure technology.
Delgado and General Products run the joint venture
General Mechanics corporation.
<P>
<B>Diamond Rain:</B>  Phenomenon common to gas giants with
large amounts of methane in their atmospheres. Where
pressures reach in excess of 20,000 atmospheres, the
carbon in these methane molecules will dehydrogenate,
forming bonds with other carbon molecules. The most
stable polymorph of carbon at these pressures is
diamond. In certain levels of the atmosphere a gas
giant of this nature will have storms or "mists" of
diamonds. Some enterprising people and companies have
actually used dredges or probes to collect these
diamonds for commercial processing.
<P>
<B>Disintegrators:</B>  Vanguard weapon system under
development by the Regency and other Spinward States.
An outgrowth of Nuclear Damper technology. Unlike
meson guns, from which they are descended,
Disintegrators are much more subtle in their
manipulation of the strong and weak forces. Mesonic
strong force, which translates between protons and
neutrons in the atomic nucleus, is actually a side
effect. The main strong force occurs between quarks
within nucleous particles, through a force messenger
particle known as a Gluon. Disintegrators suppress
this Gluonic strong force, and can break down coherent
material into its most essential elements. The
difficulty of doing that means that Disintergrators
will not be available in common service for quite some
time, possibly not until TL-17.
<P>
<B>Dreamtime:</B>  The period of Regency history 1132-1202. So
called in reference to the dreamlike, and sometimes
nightmarish period created by the Quarantine and the
war against Virus. A great sleepiness seems to prevail
within the Regency, While it has been a period of
great social advancement and technological progress,
the existence of Virus has constrained its avenues of
action to a great degree, and most of the potential
that would have been unleashed by the Psionic and
Representational Reforms has been squandered by
greater need of maintaining the Quarantine.  The
opening of the Regency Frontier in 1202 represents the
first slackening of this heightened vigilance, and may
finally bring the full fruit of the Regency's reforms
to bear.
<P>
<B>Echelon Teams:</B>  Elite Marine recon teams stationed Wildside in
listening posts (LP) or as active intelligence
gatherers. These operations are collectively referred
to as "front counter" missions. The Regency quietly
maintains a number of discrete observation posts in
Million, Atsah and Antra subsectors, and some spinward
parts of Corridor, that observe and monitor ship
movements in the Wilds.
<P>

<B>Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Weaponry:</B>   Weapons that
use discrete energy contained within an EM carrier to
sometimes destroy, but more usually influence,
personnel and technology.  EMPs are unusual in that
the power and intensity of its energy release are
largely irrelvant. Commensurate with the acupuncture
doctrine, the methodology, frequency or "algorithm" of
its energy release become more important. An EMP
weapon, than, can use any sort of EM source or carrier
wave to propogate its effect. As nearly every complex
organism, energy system and contemporary technology
uses EM fields for its own purposes, such fiddling can
be highly effective on the battlefield, as the AI
Virus has shown. EMP technologies range from weather
control satellites, to neural weapons, and all manner
of psychoactive and physioactive devices including
rumored "information management systems", a euphemism
for EM mind control.
<P>
<B>Embedded Ideology:</B>  "If the only tool you have is a
hammer, then you treat everything like a nail; if the
only tool you have is a pencil, then everything
becomes a list." As an ancient Solomani philosopher
once stated, "The medium is the message." The
intrinsic characteristics of a piece of technology
strongly determines the outcome of its usage.  This
limits the free will of a user by confining them to a
machine's  design parameters. This is not only true of
manufactured artifacts, but of all culture in general.
Broad differences will, for example, exist between a
society that is dependent upon oral culture and one
that is very literate in written language. The
philosopical implication of this is that the benefits
of ALL technological progress is relative as opposed
to the absolute teleological fact it is often assumed
to be.<P>

<B>Empyric Theory:</B>  The theory, built out of Superstring
Theory, that describes the Big Bang within the context
of ten dimensional hyperspace. Empyric Theory
reconciles Relativity and Quintessential Inflation
with String or M-Theory, and creates a mechanism that
explains the universes early fiery conception
("empyric" is Greek for fire). The theory also states
that the process of universal creation is ongoing,
with further empyric events occuring at infrequent
intervals.
<P>
According to this theory, the universe was originally
a lifeless, empty and cold void. Just an infinite
darkness with no form or substance. Then, for reasons
that are still open to speculation, a portion of
hyperspace underwent an expansion, creating heat and
energy. This event occured in the fourth spatial
dimension, dislodging the first three spatial
dimensions and the dimension of time out of Planck
space (term used for hyperspace) and into an unfolding
wave that filled part of the void. The first four
dimensions (three space and one temporal) hold on to
the fifth dimension like a vine to a wall, creeping
outwards into the void. The last six dimensions of
Superstring/M-Theory hyperspace act as scaffolding to
permit this expansion.
<P>
The manipulation of the fifth dimension by the use of
metaconductors was instrumental in the creation of
jump drives. For this reason the fifth dimension is
referred
to as "jump space."
<P>
<B>Escape Clause:</B>  Alternative safety valve built within
the Representational Reforms. Worlds with repressive
governments were offered two options:</B>  either a
refrerendum on government liberalisation, or "foot
voting" rights for its population.  Under the latter
stipulation all Regency citizens recieved the right of
freedom of movement through non-military portions of
the Regency. If a world did not issue a referendum, or
it sabotaged the process, it faced the possibility of
losing a major portion of its population through
emigration to more liberal worlds. Many dictatorships
(most notably the former high population world of
Attee/Tobia) discounted the power of this clause, and
suffered severely as a result.  Where governments
refused to liberalise through a normal process, the
escape clause became a useful stick to beat these
governments into making major changes.
<P>

<B>Extrasolar Gas Giants:</B>   Gas Giants that form in deep
space away from an known star or mass concentration
that would form a star. EGGs were rather mysterious
when first discovered, but are now thought to occur
because of small mass clumping in some parts of
stellar nebulae, and also due to earlier
misunderstanding of fusion processes.
<P>
<B>Feudalism:</B>  Noun. One of three systems of sovereignty
known to exist among human political systems. The
three systems are Centripetal (centralised),
Parallel/Hub and Spoke (Federalism) and Network
(Feudalism).  A feudal system is based upon shifting
loyalties between contending power centers, based upon
changing circumstances.  Feudal networks resemble
modern markets, with reciprocity between power centers
being the main commercial traffic.
<P>
<B>Feudal Technocracy:</B>  Also known as a network state or
corporate state. In a FT system, as with a normal
feudal system, no centralised authority is identified
or respected. Rather the controlling authority are
passive systems such as markets, networks of contact
and financial flows. Unlike a traditional feudal
oligarchy and its emphasis upon coercive military
force, reciprocal loyalty in an FT system is based on
information exchange.  Commerce and contact within an
FT network is built upon brand loyalty, shared
interest, or professional association within a loosely
committed culture of self-interested consumers and
producers.
<P>
A double degree of anarchy is therefore
institutionalised:</B>  the traditional contention of a
feudal system, and an assumption of risk by
entrepeneurial elements that can potentially upset the
balance of power in the system in unforeseeable ways.
FT states run a gamut from corporation dominated
market states, to mafia run pirate states, to
"protocol" states dominated by open access
technological or bureaucratic domains.
<P>
It has been noted that the old Imperial Interstellar
Scout Service use of "feudal technocracy" is at
variance with the above definition.  It appears that
IISS was merely attempting to reconcile the Imperial
aristocracy with other political systems in the early
years of the empires existence, and concieved a
government code that makes no sense. In most cases a
feudal technocracy code is used to refer to
governments that are either feudal (government code
3), or technocratic (code 8), but usually not both.
<P>
<B>Fire Sale of 1132:</B>  The Regency's liquidation of the
assets of megacorps bankrupted or destroyed by the
Collapse. Tukera and Hortalez et Cie's massive
consolidation efforts backfired in the face of a
network such as Virus, and their surviving assets were
sold at auction on Mora to preserve their liquidity.
All remaining Vilani bureaux assets were also sold in
this manner. A number of prominent Regency
corporations trace their rise in power in prosperity
from this event.
<P>
<B>Firewall:</B>  In contemporary parlance a physical or
electromagnetic barrier in a computer or other
electronic device that protects it against outside
interference or damage. Usually refers to antiviral
barriers and architectures in contemporary computers.
<P>
<B>Frontier Contractors:</B>  Companies under contract to the
Regency's independent Space Exploration and Contact
Office (SECO). With the demise of the RISS's
Exploration Office in the wake of the Quarantine, all
exploratory duties in the Spinward Frontier are
carried out by private firms like these. These are
primarily scout and RQS personnel who either own their
own ships, or have organised as companies to provide
frontier exploration, survey, scouting, security and
courier services along the expanding frontier.
<P>
Contracts are issued on a case by case basis, for one
particular service at a time, to prospective bidders.
Contracts include mail service, scouting, scientific
support, military protection, communal policing and
security, logistical support and basic exploration.
Most contractors are normally inactive reserve RQS or
scout personnel, but many private Condotterie units
also compete.  Vanguard Reach and Fulani Sectors
contain the majority of "Frontiersman".
<P>

<B>Gallowglass/Gallowglaigh:</B>  Freelance mercenaries. These
are usually "shirtsleeve" soldiers with requisite
military skills, but no equipment or organisation
other than that provided by their employers.  Most of
these troops are recruited into national militaries
that lack either the manpower, or a loyal enough
population to create their own forces from local
recruitment. "Foreign Legion" units are generally of
this model. The Byzantine Varangian Guard is another
example. The term is Gaelic, and refers to the loose
groups of Scottish soldiers that travelled to Ireland
to fight the Armies of Elizabethan England.
<P>
<B>General Products:</B>  Former Imperial megacorporation that
survives in the Regency and the Spinward States. GP
was primarily a manufacturer of starships,
transportation machinery and manufacturing equipment.
Slipshod management and shortsighted austerity
measures resulted in a dramatic lowering of the
company's product quality and reliability late in the
Antebellum period, a matter that came to a head with
the Kinunir fiasco. The company has managed to solve
its difficulties since the Collapse, but its
reputation still suffers. The company is an active
partner with Delgado Trading in the General Mechanics
joint venture firm.
<P>
<B>General Mechanics:</B>  Joint venture company formed by
Delgado Trading and General Products. GenMech was
established mostly at the behest of GP in an effort to
reestablish the profitability of its Post-Collapse
product lines, without the taint of its bad
reputation. GP was interested at the time in
alternative "passive" automation systems that were
Virus proof, and approached Delgado hoping to share in
that company's innovative nanoengineering technology.
GenMech has much the same portfolio as GP, but its
products always utilise the latest technology and
avant garde research. The company has recently
branched out into microsynthesis of chemicals and
pharmaceuticals, a move that has severly damaged
SuSAG's dominance in those industries. GenMech has
perhaps the largest R&D budget of any company in the
Spinward States, and its reputation for advancement
and quality has turned around the flagging reputations
of its two parent companies.
<P>
<B>Geoecological Pyramid:</B>  The massive subterranean
biosphere found within the deep crust and upper
mantles of most molten and heavy core worlds, and a
few rocky and icy core worlds too.  In conjunction
with Panspermia, it is thought that biological
material rains down from space during nebular
accretion, and that this material makes its main
foothold on a developing world in the heated rock of
newly formed worlds. This life, naturally, is
microorganismic, and is adapted to extreme
temperature, pressure and chemistry of either space,
deep underground, or both. The biomass of this
underground accumulation is hundreds of times greater
than that which lives on the surface of most worlds;
in many cases it may be the only life that exists on
an otherwise airless or dead world, if only in small
pockets.
<P>
<B>Gravitics:</B>  The science of creating, controlling and
manipulating artificially generated gravity fields and
wells.  Gravitics emerged from hyperspatial theories
that succeeded M-Theory and Superstring Theory. Early
applications included the now ubiquitous
Contra-Gravity Lifters, Artificial Gravity, and
Inertial Compensators. These devices revolutionised
transportation, effectively merging ground and air
vehicles, and becoming the mainstay of interstellar
commerce. Tractor and Repulsor/Manipulator technology
are the most sophisticated applications of Gravitic
research, and may usher in a second gravitics
revolution in the later stages of Tech Level 16.
<P>

<B>Hammerheads:</B>  The popular name for the Regency
Navy/Marines Elite Boarding Teams (EBT). The EBT was
established in the early 1130s, but wasn't deployed
until 1135, to assist in the capture of virus infected
ships, and the liberation of their captive crews. The
EBT is perhaps the most demanding special forces unit
ever created. Applicants must demonstrate
intelligence, coolness under fire, teamwork and
endurance beyond anything encountered even in Marine
Pathfinder and Regency Ranger training. Hammerheads
are usually deployed in Frontier and Safeside worlds
that lie near the most common avenues of Vampire
approach. Most of their missions are based upon
discretion:</B>  where the benefits of capturing a Vampire
ship more than outweighs the risk, especially in
humanitarian operations.
<P>
Hammerhead troops are continously drilled in ship
layouts, space systems and boarding tactics. They are
equipped with heavily armored "whaler" ships designed
to close and grapple themselves to a Vampire ship.
Individual troopers are equipped with special
battledress fitted with propulsion thrusters, plasma
and laser torches, concussion grenades, a generous
amount of demolition explosives, emp weapons and tools
designed to sever and isolate sections of a Vampires
data architecture. Physical training is especially
demanding, to simulate both zero-G and the inner
environment of a ship.
<P>
The name of these troops come from ancient Terra,
after the elite boarding units of the United States
Coast Guard that were formed during that nations
prohibition of alchohol.
<P>
<B>Hessians:</B>  Legitimate government owned military units
that are hired out to other powers as mercenaries.
This is usually done for money, though there are cases
when the military of one world is subsidised by its
neighbors for mutual defense of a region.  Like
Condotterie units, Hessians are valued for their
loyalty to their employers, and they tend to be of
very high quality and tight discipline. Some Hessian
units are held to their employers by historical events
or shared esprit de corps; examples of this include
Terra's vaunted Gurhkas, and the Vatican's Swiss
Guard.
<P>
<B>Homeland Defense Initiative of 1132:</B>  Main funding
authority and mechanism for the expansion and
maintenance of the Regency military. HDI governs all
military acquisitions, and includes a number of
military and public agencies designed to facilitate
the design, manufacture and rationalisation of all
military systems and logistics.
<P>
<B>Hot Zone:</B>  That part of the former Imperium with the
highest rate of new infection, emergence of new
strains, or greatest diversity of existing viral
types. The Hot Zone usually includes the Imperial
Core, the rimward portions of Vilani Main, and
Massilia/Diaspora.
<P>
<B>House of Ignatius:</B>  Regency banking house located on
Lunion/Lunion.  Ignatius is a family enterprise,
founded in 717, noteworthy for its financing of many
prominent enterprises within the Spinward Marches
sector. Ignatius was instrumental for funding the
expansion of Ling Standard's presence on Lunion and
nearby Strouden, had strong ties to SusAG and
Sternmetal, and strong credit lines for a number of
local shipping companies. After the Third Frontier War
the company expanded into insurance, which brought it
into competition with Hortalez et Cie and
Zirunkariish. With the demise of those two companies,
the seal of Ignatius has become prominent throughout
the Regency, whether on ship titles or insurance
policies, and it is the benchmark of insurance
underwriting for most of the Spinward Extents.
<P>
Ignatius is strictly an old fashioned banking
enterprise, concentrating in capital investment and
insurance. While perhaps the most conservative of the
Regency's major banking firms, the company's patient
style and loyal service to its depositors and
shareholders has enabled it to create a massive
clientele network in parts of the Regency that
guarantees profitability. Ignatius has something of a
common touch, as its branch offices are found on most
Regency worlds of population 6+, and it shows no
preference in its dealings with customers, whether
corporate or personal, private or public.
<P>
<B>Imperial Civil War:</B>  Also known as the Final War or the
Rebellion. The war that destroyed the Third Imperium,
and ushered in the age of Virus. The causes of the war
are varied and complex. Most historians agree that the
war grew out of a reaction to the increasingly
ossified social and political structure that had been
imposed upon the Imperium following the accession of
the Alkhalikoi Dynasty (see Lucanic Usurpation). The
war nominally started with the assassination of
Emperor Strephon's family and ceremonial double by
Dulinor, the Archduke of the Ilelish Domain.
Strephon's nephew Lucan "succeeded" to the Iridium
Throne, quickly consolidated his power without Moot
confirmation of his succession, and prosecuted a
borderline insane military campaign against Dulinor.
These headlong military thrusts drained the remainder
of the Imperium of their military forces, hastening
its collapse in the face of outside invasions by the
Solomani, Vargr and Aslan. When Lucan had exhausted
most of his frontline forces, he switched to surgical
strikes and scorched earth tactics, inflicting massive
infrastructure and industrial losses on worlds and
regions already suffering massive collateral damage
from earlier campaigns. This madness culminated in the
battle that released the AI Virus, an event that
annihilated ninety percent of all sentient life in
Charted Space, perhaps the greatest catastrophe this
Galaxy has ever seen.
<P>
<B>Incubus:</B>  A virus that successfully mimics a normally
functioning, uninfected operating system. Incubi are
unusual in that they usually represent a degradation
in viral sentience. In many cases they are descended
from fragments of previous infections, that have
merged or assimilated into the main overall operating
system and hardware of the infected system.  Only a
few basic biological patterns will carry over into the
new system, creating a feral and mindless "cave virus"
that can both operate the system to normal efficiency,
and parasitize other systems that come in contact with
it, sometimes with varying degrees of system
degradation. Several variant types of Incubi have been
identified since their discovery in Tuglikki Sector in
1191:</B> <P>

<B>1. Avatars:</B>  Echoes of previous viral infections. All
viruses leave some trace of themselves within
operating systems and hardware, and these fragments
can recombine with existing systems in a "frankenstein
monster" manner.  This creates computer systems with
strange personality quirks, and a tendency towards
possible catastrophic failure under certain
circumstances.7
<P>
<B>2. Grendels:</B>  Virus that reverts back to the original
primitive Cymbeline form. The only confirmed encounter
with this strain originated when a Virus infected ship
crash landed upon a silica rich world almost identical
in solar characteristics as the Virus homeworld. The
stranded virus strain injected its code into the
wilderness of the world either as a means of
preserving its sanity or indulging its whims. The
result was the infection, with vectorable strains, of
an entire world, a very dangerous place for the
unwary. The name for the virus came from the crew of a
Regency Beowulf class free trader that misjumped into
the Wilds, and who came in contact with not only the
wild strains, but their "mother" as well.
<P>
<B>3. Morpheus:</B>  A mutable virus that "rewrites" itself
into a algorithm that is indistinguishable from normal
human originated operating and hardware systems. This
masquearade can go on for years, even decades, before
a timer goes off, or a certain circumstance triggers a
conversion algorithm that reconverts the seemingly
innocent program into a deadly infectant. Morpheuses
are only identifiable by close examination of their
code, as they often contain extraneous algorithms that
control their transformations; or because their
imitation contains either errors or "quirks" that
reflect their original viral personalities.
<P>
<B>Journeyman:</B>  A worker or "contractor", whether by
themselves, or in conjuntion with a larger
organisation, who travels between jobs or occupations
that are scattered across space, oftentimes across
national borders. The increasingly competitive labor
markets of the Spinward States requires a mobile,
almost nomadic labor force, especially as new
technology has been implemented across the Spinward
Extents. The footloose workforce that has arisen is
primarily immigrant in origin, usually from the
Zhodani Shadow and regions adjacent to the expanded
Aslan Hierate.  Some of these workers have
institutionalised themselves into permanent vagabonds,
and have formed for profit Non-Governmental
Organisations that serve several governments at once.
It is thought that the tight labor markets created by
the Collapse within the Wilds has greatly enhanced the
value of technological workers within Virus ravaged
regions, and that skilled labor is the main trade
commodity among these regressed regions.
<P>
<B>Lucan Usurpation:</B>  Modern conspiracy theory that
purports to explain the beginning of the Imperial
Civil War in more sinister tones. The theory has
existed, unattributed to any academic origin, since
about 1145. Largely regarded as a fringe paranoid
theory, it has come under greater scrutiny by
academics in the last twenty years. The theory
purports that the events that occured on Capitol in
the aftermath of Dulinor's attack upon the royal
family were neither spontaneous nor accidental.  The
theory notes three major discrepancies in the official
record of events. First of all palace security was
compromised in a major way.  That Dulinor and several
co-conspirators were able to penetrate into the throne
room with weapons cannot be explained except by
complete incompetence upon the part of the Imperial
Bodyguard. Second of all, Lucan's ascension to the
throne was not only swift, it was orchestrated in a
manner that defies the supposed chaos on Capitol in
the aftermath. Lucan's defenestration of the Moot, the
quickness with which the royal family was buried, the
quashing of any investigation into Varian's death, and
his ability to sway the Imperial Household Bureaucracy
and the Central Military Command could not have been
accomplished by the new emperor  on the basis of his
own dubious merits and accomplishments. And finally
there is the spectacle of the real Strephon, en route
from Dynam Depot in Lishun Sector, being diverted from
Capitol upon recieving the news of "his"
assassination, instead of seizing control of the
situation as he was so obligated to do by his office.
<P>
The Usurpation theory explains these discrepancies as
being a counterrevolution. Strephon was a reformist,
and Dulinor's "reform movement" was actually of his
own devising, since the Black Archduke's appointment
would never have otherwise occured. Strephon wanted to
save the Imperium, but as with all reform movements
that are enacted when an empire is at an advanced age,
they had a paradoxical effect. The empire had grown
too old and too fragmented for his modest reforms to
be enacted, as they did not satisfy aggrieved parties,
and they threatened old elites too ossified to
sacrifice their personal power and wealth. Several
factions among the latter reacted negatively, first to
Dulinor, and finally to Strephon, hamstringing reform.
A cabal of reactionary nobles within the upper reaches
of the Imperial government finally decided to remove
Strephon, while at the same time creating the
conditions for a rejuvenation of the Imperium that
would preserve their priveleges and power intact. And
Dulinor became their scapegoat.
<P>
But as with most reactionary conspiracies, their
clarity of foresight and thouroughness of planning did
not extend beyond their plot. Their assumption was
that once Strephon was dead, and Dulinor was
implicated, the rest of the Imperium and the outside
universe would accept this fait accompli, and
everything would be magically restored. But of course
the plotters did not know about Longbow, or of
Strephons providential absence. Because Dulinor was to
be the villian, and the designated means for imperial
renewal, their planning did not account for any other
actors to spoil the play. Nor did they sufficiently
account for the ambitions of the Solomani or the
oppurtunism of the Vargr. The main complaint against
this theory is not only the lack of corroborating
evidence, but the absurdity that reduces the greatest
human tragedy in all recorded history, and reduces to
a farce perpetrated by pathetic human hubris.
<P>
<B>Lynx Society:</B>  Non-governmental scientific organisation
headquartered from Camaguey/Meizirn (Beyond 0409).
Founded in 1133 following the Collapse to preserve,
perpetuate and evolve scientific and technical
knowledge in the face of the Viral threat. The Society
is prestigious, as many governments, eager to
forestall a further collapse, encouraged their
scientists to join and pool their resources.  The
Society has branch offices on many industrial worlds,
but is best represented in Beyond and nearby Vanguard
Reaches. Membership is by invitation only, though its
rolls include distinguished amateurs as well as
professional and academic scientists.  The Society has
no research facilities of its own, but it does publish
journals and maintains databases of recent
unclassified discoveries in the sciences, engineering
and humanities. All members pay modest dues, and
digest subscriptions; but Society subsidises member
research, and most of its income results from patents
and royalties generated by such research.  The society
has a biannual convention that it convenes on various
worlds in the Spinward Hinters. The society takes its
name from the famous Italian Renaissance scientific
society, the first of its kind on Terra, a brotherhood
that included Galileo.
<P>
<P>
<B>M-Theory:</B>  Precursor to J-space/Unified Hyperspace
Theory. Unifies all of the various Superstring
theories into one framework. Under normal mathematics,
five different superstring regimes existed. Thanks to
Witten on Terra, and Ploiabr on Zhdant, the five
theories were unified around a semi-lucid unity called
M-theory. Under this scheme the strings of superstring
theory are converted into a single series of simple
hyperspatial geometries, into which our universe could
be identified. M-theory eventually, by reconciliation
with other competing hyperspatial theories, became the
basis for J-Space theory, and the invention of jump
drive.
 <P>
<B>Manipulator Thruster:</B>  New TL-16/17 thruster currently
under development by the Regency. Unlike the mythical
Thruster Plate, which is simply perpetual motion
applied to propulsion, a Manipulator Thruster is a
reaction based engine. An MT generates a gravity well
in front of a ship or vehicle, which provides
acceleration. Because gravity is an infinite force,
the velocities of all objects in the universe are
affected to some small degree by this artificial
gravity well, keeping the thruster within the bounds
of thermodynamics and Newtons laws.  Because a
Manipulator doesn't provide a pushing thrust, but
rather a pull down a gravitational gradient, engineers
have dubbed it a "slide rocket."
<P>
Problems with "gravitational pollution", whereby the
effects of thousands of thrusters over a period of
time can distort the paths upon all objects in a local
 solar system, have so far prevented deployment of the
basic system, which has been in existence since the
Imperial Civil War. Engineers are working on a Cycling
Manipulator, so called because it creates a moving
g-well that partially compensates for the
gravitational momentum it creates in other objects in
nearby proximity.
<P>
<B>Metastable Metallic Hydrogen:</B>  When ordinary mono or
diatomic hydrogen is compressed at pressures in excess
of fifteen to twenty thousand atmospheres, internal
repulsion between hydrogen atoms is overcome and
metallic bonds are formed.  This condition is
"metastable", meaning that this substance only exists
within a narrow range of circumstances, and will
quickly revert to a more normal equilibrium with the
right stimulus, such as compression in a fusion
reactor. Nevertheless MMH is a very lightweight
material, comparable in strength (though not density)
to aluminum, and can be used as a strutural material
in some commercial applications.
<P>
MMH naturally occurs in stars and gas giants where the
weight of the atmosphere and density of the gas become
sufficient for its formation. At a depth of around
1000 to 2000 kms, a metallic "surface" of hydrogen
will form in these bodies, one capable of conducting
heat and electricity in the same manner as all other
metallic substances. The existence of this phenomenon
(Authors note:</B>  The following is merely my own educated
opinion.) is important to the reconciliation of fusion
processes, both "hot" and "cold" at TL-9. Cold Fusion
is in a solid state, where a metallic catalyst creates
a "crystal" of hydrogen that fuses into helium.
Further surveys of solar "hot" fusion, where a high
pressure solution of metallic hydrogen is mixed with
metallic catalysts, is virtually no different than
cold fusion, except for the scale. All working fusion
reactors that have ever existed are high pressure
gas-metal catalytic cells which compress powerplant
hydrogen to a metallic state, thereby creating a
fusion process that can be utilised for useful power.


<P>
<B>Molecular Computers:</B>  Also known as Biocomputers. MCs
utilise chemical reactions, such as the selective
breaking of chemical bonds, for processing data. The
most common processor is artificial DNA, whose
periodic and algorithmic nature permits easy
manipulation and design of chemical circuits. That
same DNA also permits easy storage of memory. The
first DNA computers are invented at TL-9, and become
widely available starting at the upper limits of
TL-10, replacing normal solid-state induction-gate
processors like silicon and carbon. They replace
silicon and other solid state memory media at TL-12.
Because of the small size of DNA strands, and other
biochemical relays, an MC can be built to very small
scales, making them ideal for nanotechnological
applications. Molecular Computers are immune to Viral
infection, though some scientists wonder if that will
always be the case.

 <P>
(For more info see
http:</B> //www.mitre.org/research/nanotech/biocomputers.html)
<P>
<B>Money Laundering:</B>  The conversion of money and assets
from illegal activities into legal bonds, stocks and
certificates.  Money Laundering is made much easier in
this day and age thanks to the slow flow of
information and the sophistication of modern forgery.
It was difficult even during the Antebellum period for
any interstellar society to verify the source of
"offshore" money flowing through their borders. Many
states could do little more than "barricade" their
money against currency manipulation, or tightened
deposit rules, but otherwise left money flows
virtually unregulated. Fortunately, the difficulty of
currency conversion limited manipulation to "kiting",
the use of unsecured bonds for use as collateral in
obtaining loans and capital.  Since the Collapse, the
increasing need for economic cooperation has loosened
currency regulations in many Spinward States, allowing
for easier conversion of offshore money by criminal
organisations.  Beyond Sector and parts of Far
Frontiers are the main centers for this illegal
traffic.
<P>
<B>Muirimianism:</B>  Religion practiced by the people of the
Regency of Muirimi and the Nakris Confederacy. It is
an "occulted sovereign" religion similar to Terran
Rastifarianism and the Canuban cult. The religon
centers around the (possibly apocryphal) person of
Muirimi, alledgedly a high ranking member of the
Terran military that was a Terran military governor of
Daibei and then Zarushagar sectors during the latter
stages of the Interstellar Wars. The cult transformed
Muirimi from an obscure myth into a towering messianic
figure. It proclaimed a philosophy of the chosen
within the true faith, dedicated to equality and
justice for the believers, and foretold a day when
Muirimi would return to the world from his hiding
place, and usher in an apocalyptic age.
<P>
The cult emerged in Zarushagar during the Twilight
period following the disintegration of the Rule of
Man, mostly among the increasingly desperate lower
classes of the region. When the remaining authorities
tried to supress the religion in light of its anarchic
attitude, a revolt erupted that led to the cult
leaders and most of their followers fleeing across the
Great Rift and settling in Beyond and Iphegenaia
sectors. The original religion has been watered down
into the mainstream Regency and the more pastoral
Nakrisian heresy.
<P>

Nanogathics:</B>  Nanobots used to restore teleomeres.
<P>
<B>Nanotechnology:</B>  Machinery that is constructed at the
molecular level. First available at TL-10. Most
Nanotech is primarily automated machinery used in
manufacturing and medical applications.  As most
nanobots are generally too small and simple for viral
infection, they have become a primary "antiviral" as
they are quick, difficult to destroy, and often
preserve most of the original hardware.
<P>
<B>Non-Governmental Organisations:</B>  Organisations that are
dedicated to functions and causes that transcend
normal nationalistic boundaries. Such organisations
include charities, relief and aid services, and
development agencies. The most famous and obvious
example is the Traveller's Aid Society.
<P>
Most NGOs BTC are primarily private
information-for-fee agencies, private law enforcement
services, medical relief, and several private
exploratory companies in service to the Regency RQS or
Frontier Exploratory and Contact Office (FECO).
<P>


 <P>
<B>Orbital Resonance:</B>  Modern theory of solar system
formation. Contrary to the classical view of nebular
accretion, nascent solar systems rarely possess neat,
regimented orbital structures. In reality, the great
differences in distribution in mass within an
accretionary disk are so great, especially when gas
giants are formed, that orbits are chaotic and
disorderly.  Gas giants and binary stars are either
cannibalistic, swallowing smaller worlds, or bullying,
hurling worlds out of a solar system alltogether. But
as with most chaotic systems, order eventually
emerges, and the system stabilises. In most cases
orbiting objects will attain, through mutual
gravitational influence, a resonant cycle where they
support each other and stabilise each others orbits.
Such orbital resonance is the main reason why
habitable worlds exist, otherwise marauding gas giants
will pilfer a system's life zone in nearly all other
cases.

<B>Panspermia:</B>  Theory of life origin first postulated by
the Greek philosopher Anaxagoras. The theory holds
that all life originates in the vacuum of space. Amino
acids have been shown to form in nebula clouds, and
many bacteria are capable of subsisting in extreme
conditions, including the cold of space and high
levels of solar radiation. As nebula accretion forms a
solar system, bolide impacts into volcanic rock seeds
a young world with these amino acid/protolife
contructs, where they can quickly establish themselves
in the hot water circulating through the early crust
and upper mantle.
<P>
(This theory should really recieve an IMTU code of its
own. Because it speculates that ALL life in the
universe, regardless of its location, has the same
origin, if not the same source. At one extreme there
should exist a code for panspermia only, a middle code
for a complex interaction between space and
terrestrial genesis, and at the other extreme the
spontaneous generation theory where life only develops
because of some unknown alchemy within the hot rock
and thick atmosphere of a young world.)
<P>
<B>Passive Recuperative Systems:</B>  PRS are self-sustaining
or self-perpetuating mechanical, electronic and
biological systems designed to remain functional
despite damage or viral infection.  Also known as
trapeze systems, for they are like a person on a
trapeze who uses their momentum or balance to carry
them through the air, and perform their stunts. Most
of these systems are engineered towards maintaining
simple functions, such as flight for a gravitic city,
life support for a space station, hull integrity for a
starship...etc.  When damaged or stressed, they
maintain enough inner fortitude or design flexibility
to resist, or preferably, recuperate the energy or
disintegration created to their continued function or
perpetuation. Most PRS use smart materials and
advanced bioorganic parts in their construction. Most
are actually dumb systems, organised around passive or
embedded algorhithm(s) that dominates their
operations, and are therefore immune to everything but
total destruction.  Most critical life support, power
distribution and certain automation systems
constructed since 1132 are PRS.
<P>
<B>Plague Reign:</B>  One of two sociological theories
concerning the Viral Wilds that exist in the Regency
(See Turk's Reign). This theory proposes that the
situation in the Wilds is similiar to that which
existed on Terra's European continent following the
Black Death pandemic.
<P>
Virus, like the Black Death, wiped out a good portion
of the preexisting sentient population. In this case
about 99.7 percent of all life. The majority of
survivors are to be found upon more habitable worlds,
generally T-norms and T-primes, where less reliance
upon advanced technology allowed for most of their
populations to survive the viral onslaught.
Nonetheless the near destruction of the world that
these survivors once knew has had a pronounced effect
upon their worldview, beliefs and ideologies. The old
Imperial system has been destroyed, and a social
evolution is underway that is attempting to replace
the old ways with customs and ideas more suitable for
local circumstances.
<P>
The massive die off makes skilled labor both rare and
extremely precious. Even where worlds have suffered
only minor casualties, there exists great need for
people with the technological and professional skills
required for reconstruction. As with post-Black Death
Europe, such skilled workers are likely to be the main
economic commodity, both within their communities and
wherever interstellar travel has been preserved.
Aggressive behavior by local warlords is likely to be
more restrained in hopes of attracting and retaining
the services of such journeymen.  Where local
circumstances are favorable, such workers may even
pool their resources and begin the instruction of new
workers, allowing for an extension of the total
knowledge base for an accelerated recovery and the
wider benefits of educational advancement and
enfrancisement.
<P>
<B>Plan B Colonies:</B>  Colonies established in Fulani and
Theron sectors by the Spinward States in the wake of
the Rape of Trin. Following the successful attack by
the Kishkii and her fleet, the possibility of further
successful penetrations of the Quarantine convinced
several Spinward States to "hedge their bets." A
consortium of private Regency, Zhodani and Spinward
Hinter colonial ventures were established with the
view of colonising the uninhabited worlds of Fulani,
Astron and other spinward sectors on the backside of
the Spinward Extents from the Wilds.  With assistance
from the Regency's Space Exploration and Contact
Office and its private "Frontiersman" contractors,
several colonial ventures were launched in the 1140s
and 50s, concentrating in the trailing half of Fulani
sector.
<P>
<B>Punctuated Equilibrium:</B>  Significant modification of
evolutionary theory, first proposed by Solomani
scientist Stephen Jay Gould. Unlike normal Darwinian
evolution and its assumption of a steady level of
mutation, PE stipulates that the development of new
species is an uneven process. While mutation is
constant, a level of biological equilibrium is
generally maintained over the course of the prevailing
climactic or geological period, and these mutations
are suppressed in favor of the more successful
species. Conversely, when that period is disrupted,
these mutations are no longer supressed, and the more
successful and viable mutations become dominant in a
short period of geological time. Past assumptions
about speciation was that it took millions of years,
under PE it may take only 10,000-20,000 years to
accomplish. The emergence of Virus, while conducive to
the PE model, has a rapidity that has challenged even
that conservative number, and some biologists are
already arguing for Viral specialisation over the next
300 to 400 years.
<P>
<B>Poison Pills:</B>  Anti-viral devices that activate when
viral infection of the system it is emplaced occurs.
Either the virus is killed, or the system will
self-destruct. Such systems include
exothermic/endothermic chemical cells, explosives,
powersurge strips, and disconnective circuit breakers.
<P>
<B>Pygmalion Paradox:</B>  The tendency of technology, as it
becomes more advanced or complex, to reflect
increasingly primitive or lifelike tendencies, or the
foibles and limitations of its creators.  By
approaching the threshold of sentience, or life
imitation, technology becomes more beholden to its
embedded design ideology, and more autonomous of
personal control. Machines evolve a "secret life" that
increasingly isolates users from their more essential
functioning.  The result is a  technological world
that is surreal and neo-animistic, with strong
parallels to the worlds conjured in ancient or
traditional myth structures.
<P>

<B>Quantum Computer:</B>  A computer that utilizes Quantum
Mechanical operations as a processor. Imagine that a
person has misplaced an important briefcase in a
high-rise office building. The person remembers is
that he placed in a desk in one of the hundreds of
offices inside the building, but has no recollection
of which office on which floor...etc.  Now he could
check each office, one at a time, but that would take
forever, and he has to find it right now. But what if
he cloned himself a number of times equal to the
number of offices? Each clone would be able to check
one office each, and the probability that the
briefcase will be found as quickly as possible is
nearly 100 percent. A quantum computer works in much
the same fashion. The base science of QM is the idea
that an electron is not a hard or discrete "meatball"
of matter, but rather a dispersed if not phantasmic
energy wave whose position is rather uncertain at any
given instant. To determine the probable positio of an
electron, physicists use wave functions, which is a
number matrix that defines that probability. But since
an electrons position is a probability, a Quantum
computer can function in much the same way that our
forgetful busninessman found his briefcase, by
expressing a computational algorithm as a wave
function, permitting the algorithm to "check each room
at the same time" so to speak.  Quantum computers were
first invented at TL8/9, but do not become practical
until TL-10, and in wide commercial and military use
until TL-13.  Early QCs relied upon supercooled
liquids and lasers to chill the computational medium
to above absolute zero, removing thermodynamic
interference and placing it at the ground state most
conducive for problem solving. Later computers use
magnets, "Quantum Traps" and gravitic technologies;
contemporary systems use new subatomic and "quantum
gate" technology to further enhance their power. QCs
are immune to Viral infection.
<P>
<B>Quantum Teleportation:</B>  Method of teleportation using
"Quantum Entanglement." Teleportation via signal
transmission was once thought to be impossible,
because of the difficulties created by the Uncertainty
Principle, where the method of analysing the atomic
and subatomic particles in an object actually disrupts
the information inherent to them. But a number of
advanced physics, utilising the QE effect, otherwise
known as the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox,
have successfully created perfect copies of quanta.
The only stipulation is that the original copy be
destroyed (a method of teleportation described in
Traveller canon).

 <P>
Normal mechanical teleportation, for a number of
scientific and technical reasons, has been shown to be
impossible. The bigger and the more massive the object
to be scanned, and then transmitted, the more
difficult it is for even powerful computers to
encompass every particle, without errors from
developing during scanning. Even with the QE method,
errors are inevitable. However, teleportation of small
(<5 kilograms) objects may one day be possible. Even
more interesting is the idea that certain materials do
not have to be carried between worlds as bulk cargo:</B>
if they are small enough, they can be carried
electronically on a courier or X-boat, and be
downloaded into a copying or cloning machine at its
destination.

 <P>
<B>Quarantine:</B>  The defensive cordon of customs and
military forces, combined with protective technical
protocols, intended to prevent infection by the AI
Virus. The Quarantine was the main focus of the
Spinward Accords:</B>  signing created an obligation for
each member state "to create, uphold and maintain
certain regulations aimed at preventing viral
infection among the Spinward States, and building and
maintaining sufficient forces to enforce the
Quarantine at all necessary points of their
space...... within a reasonable framework that can be
considered responsible within the tenets of the
Accords." This last bit of text permits some leeway to
signers to create a Quarantine within the contexts of
their own particular circumstances, without
undermining the common defense and welfare of the
Spinward States as a whole.
<P>
This little bit of wriggle room has created a wide and
varying degree of interpretations of a Quarantine that
is "considered responsible" by the whole. Arguably the
strictest Quarantine is maintained by the largest
Spinward States:</B>  the Regency, the Aslan along the Rift
and the Zhodani. Regulations generally become more
lax, and enforcement less stringent as one gets
farther away from the trailing "hot zone." Within the
more spinward reaches, especially the New Colonies in
Fulani or Theron sectors, or regions farther along the
Zhodani Shadow, the Quarantine exists mainly in name
rather than in fact.
<P>
<B>Quintessence:</B>  Also known as Dark Energy or Cosmic
Inflation.  A theory that explains the apparent
"Horizon" paradox posed by the Big Bang theory.
Measurements of the oldest observable stars in the
universe purport to show a universe that is approx. 15
billion years old. But measurements of those objects
with the greatest red shifts show a universe that is
far larger (approx. 17-19 billion light years) than
what should be observed.  This is akin to travelling
in a car across a featureless plain at about 100 km
per hour for one hour,  stopping after one hour of
driving and measuring the distance travelled with a
laser, and finding that you've travelled 120 km.
Cosmic Inflation states that the vacuum that all
matter "floats" in is itself undergoing expansion with
the rest of the universe. The 20 km discrepancy you
experienced while driving can be explained if the ROAD
had been stretching at 20 km/hr by itself while the
car had been moving. Quintessence is postulated as the
energy that is creating this expansion, and is thought
to be resistant to normal gravitational attraction.
<P>

<B>Regency 231st Fleet:</B>  Regency Intelligence unit
stationed at Auitawry and Sarage. The 231st was built
upon the old Crosshairs courier route, and has been
instrumental in the interception of large Vampire
Fleets crossing the Verge Connector into the
vulnerable knot of the Aslan Colonies. The fleet was
originally a complicated mixture of intel gathering,
courier and special operations forces designed for
both early warning of Vampire movements, and to
recover vital personnel and technology from the
Federation of Ilelish and Usdiki. Because of its
remote location, and vital strategic role, the fleet
maintains combat units of its own. Usually these are
ships captured or salvaged in fighting in Verge and
Ilelish sectors, whether viral infected or not.  The
231st works closely with the Aslan Quarantine forces,
and is permitted limited access to their facilities in
trailing Trojan Reach. Because of its peculiar
position, only the best military and RQS personnel are
assigned to its ranks. In 1149 the worlds of Tisilli
and Browne were ceded by the Aslan, and are currently
under the protection of the 231st.

 <P>
<B>Regency 269th Fleet:</B>  Regency intelligence unit
stationed at Errogel/Atsah. The 269th, like its sister
the 231st to rimward, is charged with intelligence
gathering along the Wildside approaches to the Regency
frontier. Its area of responsibility are Corridor,
Vland, Tuglikki, Provence, and technically all of the
sectors stretching to trailing along the old
Imperial/Vargr border, and the entire Vargr Extents,
though in practice this is impossible. Unlike their
sister fleet, the 269th lacks frontline military units
of its own, and extensive ties to the Joint Special
Operations Command; but it compensates through the
maintenance of an extensive free trader network that
provides reliable data from as far as trailing
Corridor and Provence.
<P>
<B>Regnecy Starship Shortage:</B>   The Domain of Deneb was
totally unprepared for the onslaught of Virus in 1131.
Even worse, the battering of the Civil War and Aslan
and Vargr invasions made it difficult to quickly
adjust to the new threat. To defend against the
growing flow of vampire fleets making their way across
or around the Great Rift, the new Regency of Deneb
needed as many warships as could be constructed in a
short amount of time.  The ensuing shortage of ships
came as something of a shock, given the massive
capacity that had existed BTC for several centuries,
but this can be explained for a number of reasons.
<P>
Had it merely been a matter of new construction, and
higher priorities on military construction, the
disruption of civilian starship markets would have
been bad enough. Regency/DoD shipbuilders had to also
upgrade and modify tens of thousands of already extant
starships to new virus resistant computer and
communication systems, diverting scarce resources and
space to this necessary project. The economic
recession that came out of commercial contraction
during the Civil War had robbed shipbuilders of the
capital needed for expansion or upgrades of their
yards, and equipment and personnel were in many cases
inadequate for the task. While the Regency government
and its new Ministry of Shipping managed to subsidise
new shipyard construction, and alleviate crowding, a
disruption of new civilan ship construction was
unavoidable.
<P>
Factors outside of starship construction also
contributed to shortages.  The Abandonment took
thousands of starships out of normal paying service
along the critical starlanes of what would later be
called the Regency Stronghold. Despite careful
scheduling, an acute shortage of merchant vessels
caused a massive jump in freight fees, and several
worlds had great difficulty in shipping or recieving
vital goods.  Coupled with a growing population and a
greater reliance upon internal trade, the market for
new starships was too exorbitantly expensive for most
buyers. It wasn't until around 1150 that enough yard
space, producing enough new starships, under enough
careful management of the Shipping Ministry that the
market finally began to tip towards new buyers; but by
that time the damage had been done.
<P>
The panic of the early Collapse had forced the
induction of thousands of older obsolete and
obsolescent merchant and military vessels into
service, and many of these have only been removed from
active
service in the last decade or so. The "shortage" has
been over since 1170, but these older ships, and
lingering demand by the military, still creates
anxiety within the public.
<P>

 <P>
<B>Repulsor Weaponry:</B>  Weapons that propel a projectile
through the use of a repulsor generated gravity well,
which proceeds away from the muzzle of the weapon.
Repulsor guns have several distinct advantages over
conventional weapons. The gravity well does not
require a CPR gun's long barrel for stablisation, nor
the complex electronic assemblies of gauss weapons.
And acceleration of the round can continue AFTER it
leaves the barrel. In artillery applications, the
projection of gravitational effects can permit rounds
to be shot in sinous or non-ballistic paths to avoid
being shot down or betraying their launcher by their
paths. Engineers have also played with creating
"ablative pockets", an insulating outer liner, when
combined with the air pocket created by the gravity
well, permits higher round velocities in excess of
what is permissible normal weapons. Repulsor Weapons
are still largely experimental, and only a few Regency
Army units, and the Mora and Vincennes world armies,
have deployed them in regular frontline service.

 <P>
(Yes, this entry is based in part on MTJ 3's info on
Vincennes, and Tim Zimmerman's gravitic weapons on
BARD.)
<P>


 <P>
<B>Scapegoat:</B>  A ship or piece of technology set out as
bait for vampire ships or fleets. These are generally
dilapidated small merchant ships, that usually loiter
above prime refueling areas. These ships contain
skeletal crews, and always operate in conjunction with
a concealed naval squadron, usually battle riders or
SDB's hidden in the upper reaches of a gas giant,
underwater, or in the sensor shadows of asteroids and
small moons.
<P>
<B>Slingshot:</B>  A military strategy that places the
logistical support arm of a military force into the
vanguard of the advance. This strategy recognises that
a military advance only goes as fast as its supply
lines will allow it. Therefore rather than allowing
forces to advance at will, outstripping their
resupply, the pace of advance is limited to the pace
with which supply and support units can maintain by
themselves. Generally this requires more resources be
spent upon logistical mobility, and the development of
smaller, more mobile combat units.  It is speculated
by some that the Regency has spent the majority of the
resources allocated to a possible reconquest of the
former Imperium upon fleets of supply ships, mobile
depots and forward emplaced supply caches in the Rift
just for such an eventuality.
<P>
 <P>
<B>Smart Guns:</B>  Guns that are built with computer guidance
and advanced sensors to optimise their lethality.
Smart Gun technology first appears at TL-9, but really
come into their own with the widespread deployment of
gauss weapons. These guns include ballistic computers,
IGS/GPS positioning, laser guidance and other
high-tech enhancements commonly found on vehicle
units. More advanced TL-12+ weapons include "carriage"
barrels cushioned on superconducting magnets to
improve accuracy, waldo stabilised "steady guns",
look-shoot-kill heads up displays, and self-guiding
ammunition. TL-14+ weapons incorporate material
density sensors to be used in conjunction with


 <P>


<B>Smart Materials:</B>  Generally a reference to materials
that can be "programmed" or specially modified to
change or react to different or changing
circumstances. More specifically it refers to
materials that are constructed at the molecular,
atomic and subatomic levels to be complex
microengineering systems in their own right, actively
or passively adapting to changes they sense in the
outside environment.
<P>
The first smart materials are TL 6 and 7 "memory
metals", alloys that can revert to their originally
casted forms despite deformation. Most early smart
materials rely upon simple chemical properties; later
materials are literally constructed one atom at a time
through the use on nanoprobes and advanced computer
modelling. Many TL-9+ materials literally become
advanced algorhithmic systems in their own right.
<P>
TL-10 to 13 materials include advanced molecular
construction, "frameworking" or resonant feedback
materials, materials with microcircuitry and
nanocapacitors, "free-energy" nanomaterials that
generate electrical current from friction or
environmental heat.
<P>
TL-14 and higher materials include microgravitic
nanowell impregnation, quantitized spontaneous energy
release (which is to say they can create laser energy
at certain energy states), strong-weak force doping,
supercritical phase shifters (they turn from solid to
plastic to liquid, or liquid to plastic to solid
depending to their circumstances),vacuum
nano-crystallisation, and hyperspatial energy
shunting.
 <P>
<B>Snakehead Rounds:</B>  Bullets that carry a discrete energy
pattern optimised for the material they will
penetrate. Snakehead rounds are designed around liquid
polymer explosives, that is "staged" by an internal
nanotech catalyst. In conjunction with a smart gun
equipped with a densitometer or density reading laser,
the internal nannites arrange themselves into a
colloidal structure that directs explosive energy
according to the internal resonance of the material
that it must penetrate or destroy.
<P>

<B>Space Exploration and Contact Office (SECO):</B>
Independent Regency government agency established in
the aftermath of the disestablishment of the Regency
Interstellar Scout Service's Exploration Office.

<P>
<B>Superstring Theory:</B>  First hyperspatial theory to be
developed upon Terra and Zhdant. The theory emerged
out of a growing interest in application of Relativity
theory within spatial dimensions beyond the normal
three.  In higher dimensions, relativity can be
reconciled with quantum mechanics in a rather
interesting manner. This includes a "crystalline"
state for the emergence of the hitherto invisible
graviton. But this reconciliation requires that the
abstract "point" particle of classical physics be
replaced with a tangible but dispersed one dimensional
"string" or two dimensional membrane (see M-theory for
the latter).  The theory's mathematics were extremely
complex even for starflight era physics, and it
eventually game way to M-theory.
<P>
<B>Technology of Humility:</B>  New technological paradigm in
fashion with the Spinward States since the Collapse.
Enshrines a greater skepticism about the benefits of
technological advancement. The benefits of
trailblazing research and development is now weighed
by the public and institutions against its possible
social cost, whether in increased alienation or
environmental impact.  The novelty of technology is
now less important than its quality of construction,
ability to enhance the quality of life, and its
relative usefulness. The most pronounced application
is the growing nanotechnology trend within the
Regency.
<P>


<B>Teleomeric Regeneration:</B>  Teleomeres are sections of
DNA, found in every lifeform, that regulate the number
of cell divisions any particular kind of cell may
undergo before terminating. Teleomeres usually come in
bundles of distinct sections, which progressively
shorten with each cell reproduction. Eventually the
telemeres terminate, and the cell simply dies without
further division. These "death clocks" regulate aging
to a major extent. Normal anagathics can slow or
temporarily prevent this shortening, but the long term
goal is to create a means of permanent regeneration,
possibly with the use of so called Nanogathics.

 <P>
The Third Imperium had been pursuing such research
feverishly before the Civil War, and a number or
research stations in the Domain of Deneb were part of
this research effort. The massive research
infrastructure needed to combat Virus, and the public
outcry over Imperial subsidence of percieved class
inequalities like aging research (which only the
wealthy could technically afford) compelled the
Regency to abandon the field to private companies.
Most aging research is now undertaken by the "DNA
Valley" on Magash/Sabine, with assistance from
nanotech companies on Mora and Vincennes.
<P>
<B>Transstar Deneb:</B>
The strangest story in Imperial or
Regency corporate history. In the aftermath of the
First Solomani Rim War, SolSec discovered that the
Verge Connector was poorly defended by the Third
Imperium against outside intrusion or espionage.
Using a number of front companies, a spy operation
codenamed "Crosshairs" was established in nearby
Hlakhoi sector under the cover of the Aslan Hierate.
For security reasons, the only connection between
these "cutouts" was a network of Transstar subsidiary
companies operating legitimately within the border
region between the Hierate and the Solomani
Confederacy. Crosshairs was successful enough at
penetrating Imperial security that the operation was
expanded into a major courier and espionage network
running through the Hierate, jumping the Rift, and
terminating among the minor client states of the
Trojan Reach and Beyond Sectors. An information and
assistance channel was even opened up between SolSec
and the Zhodani, though that never panned out the way
the two groups had hoped.
<P>
The breakout of the Imperial Civil War caused a
feverish increase in operations for Crosshairs. Its
"backdoor" into the Federation of Ilelish gave it a
frontrow seat into the main battlefront of the war,
and its agents were only too happy to launch
provocative strikes against both Lucan and Dulinor. As
the war dragged out, contact was made with the growing
opposition in some parts of the Federation to Dulinors
increasingly authoritarian rule; evidence exists that
a sizeable amount of support for the Verge Secession
came from Crosshairs. But by that time rifts serious
rifts had developed within the Solomani leadership,
and the position of Solomani companies within the
Hierate was being compromised by the dragging out of
the Civil War. Several SolSec operatives turned
freelance, or came into contact with interested
Imperial factions, as a means of their own survival.
<P>
Around 1121 a number of operatives stationed among the
Human client states BTC were induced into defecting to
the Domain of Deneb, and they brought their spycraft
and diplomatic experience with them. Several Crosshair
operatives helped to negotiate the safe passage of the
Arrival Vengeance mission through the Aslan Hierate,
and their success encouraged other critical SolSec
operatives to seek out employment or safe haven within
the DoD. By 1128, DoD intelligence had parasatized the
entire courier network with double agents under the
auspicies of Operation Unicorn. This network became
critical during the early months of the Collapse,
permitting an uninterrupted diplomatic and information
contact with the Aslan Colonies, and in the evacuation
of vital Imperial personnel and materials via the
Verge Connector.  The network even evacuated a number
of Solomani, Daibeian and Ilelishi naval personnel
from Magyar and Dark Nebula sectors.
<P>
The shortage of starships that ensued within the
Regency created a new utility for the former Crosshair
personnel. The courier network was institutionalised
as a public company, using the Transstar name, and was
immediately put to work in helping coordinate the
Abandonment, and effectively managing starship
distribution during that difficult period. When the
Abandonment ended, the company was semi-privatised and
subsidised, and became a universal service company
intended to maintain starship distribution and
reliable freight service until enough starships could
be built to restore profitable private service.  It
has been noted that Transstar Deneb has supplanted
Imperiallines Deneb as the Regency's primary support
and courier service, as it larger freighter hulls are
easily convertable into auxiliary warships and support
transports for Quarantine service.
<P>Transstar Deneb is headquartered from Mora, but
maintains offices at most Regency A and B class
starports.  The company maintains a general freight
and passenger office, a courier and express cargo
service in conjunction with the X-Web, and a "public
service" office that works with the Regency military
and intelligence services.  The company retains strong
ties to the security services, and most of its higher
executives and nearly all of its crews are
ex-military. About twenty percent of its fleet is in
the RQS or Naval Auxiliary. In recent years the
company has slowly abandoned the universal service
decree of its original charter, and has begun
positioning itself for expansion into the Wilds
pending approval from the Regency Senate.
<P>

<B>Turk Reign:</B>  One of two Regency sociological theories
regarding the Viral Wilds. Where Plague Reign tends to
minimise the impact of Virus to that of a passing
epidemic, Turk's Reign incorporates the increasing
adaptability of Virus to human technology, and its
growing ability to manipulate its environment.  The
Wilds are more akin to the European portion of the old
Ottoman Turk empire on old Terra in the period of
1453-1918 CE.
<P>
The Turkish Empire was a ramshackle tyranny, dominated
by a military elite that became glutted and lazy upon
its massive conquests of nearly a third of Europe, and
major portions of the Near East and North Africa. When
it was challenged by European powers, its rule became
frightfully corrupt and brutal. It taxed its subjects
to the quick. Its courts and officials were graft
prone. Its soldiers and police were brutal, and were
given to punitive plundering and rape. It shackled its
subjects under a backwards and primitive medievalism
that was hostile to the intellect and speculative
thought, or any kind of dissent. And its high
officials ruled the lands with a heavy and clumsy hand
at all times. Under this constant harassment, the
lands and peoples under their rule fell behind the
west, and in many cases regressed into brutality and
corruption of their own. When they were finally
liberated, they were left to fight among themselves
over the scraps left to them by their departed
overlords, with little or no chance of obtaining the
fruits of modernity for themselves.
<P>
The Wilds, according to this comparitive view, are
under the sovereignty of the crazed and erratic Virus
and its Vampire Fleets. As with the Plague's Reign
Theory, the population dieback that occured has
greatly increased the value of skilled labor, but the
heavyhanded nature of the worst of Vampires and Virus
has returned the former Imperium back to a premodern
time of fear and introspection. Travellers are subject
to attack at all times; bandits flourish alongside
predatory Vampire ships, and every surviving
settlement is subject to attack, reprisal and the
"tax" of enforced servitude to a Vampire fleet or
human slaver. The chances that the Wilds can recover
in a positive form without outside assistance are
practically nil.
<P>

<B>Vaccines:</B>  Lobotomised or domesticated viruses used to
protect a system against infection by a hostile virus.
Most vaccines are experimental, and controversial.
Most are chimera's, engineered mixtures of viral
chip-codes and anthrogenic material. Public activism
is buttressed in this area by academic, humanitarian
and professional objections to its amoral and
unethical implications, and the percieved instability
of most of these systems.
<P>

 <P>
<B>Van Kreden's Death Ride:</B>  The quixotic misadventure of
one Baren Von Kreden, a nobleman native to
Gungnir/Sword Worlds. In 1112 the de facto ruler of
Gungnir, a certain "King" Arthur, was assassinated by
a young woman. Xenophobic elements within the
planetary nobility declared that his death was the
result of an Imperial plot, and attempted to whip up
local sentiment against the Imperium. But as is
usually the case with Sword Worlders, the frenzy broke
down into internecine fighting over the right of
succession, and that should have ended an possibility
of retaliation against the Imperium. Van Kreden, one
of Arthur's most fervent if unbalanced supporters,
stood back from the fray, and assembled a ramshackle
fleet in orbit. In mid 1112, the fleet left Gungnir,
penetrated the Imperial border, and attacked Frenzie.
The local defense squadron destroyed Van Kreden's
followers to a man, though not the demented baron.
Undaunted, perhaps even emboldened, by the destruction
of his forces, the baron jumped outsystem, and then
steadily blazed a trail of senseless, pointless
violence across the Spinward Marches. His journey
culminated at Mora, where he set his ship into a
kamikaze dive towards the newly constructed Giyachii
arcology and the incomplete Domain capitol, oblivious
to the resistance of both the 73rd Fleet and the local
SDB squadron. His fervent determination proved no
match for a full BatRon that had just arrived from
Core, and he was slaughtered before he even made
geosynchronous orbit.

 <P>
Despite its obvious stupidity, his act of suicidal
defiance inspired several similar terrorist acts among
other deranged Sword Worlders, though none matching
its scale. After the Sword World Occupation, Van
Kreden became a mythic figure among hardline
resistance movements, inspiring yet more suicidal acts
by Anti-Regency terrorists. Among Regency immigrants
in the occupied Sword Worlds, and even many Sword
Worlders, to be a "Van Kreden" is to be engaged in a
pointless, futile and shallow endeavor.

 <P>
(Van Kreden's Death Ride is from Gurps:Traveller Behind the Claw.)

 <P>
<B>Vampire King:</B>  Term for a virus that dominates a world,
Vampire fleet or fuedal assemblage.

<P>
<B>Ventana Project:</B>  Controversial research project
carried out at the Rift Sector Research Station Gamma
in the Regency during the 1150-1160s. Full disclosure
of the project has never occured, but allegations of
mind control experiments have surfaced in relation to
this project. Ventana is mentioned in the RASAC
archives leaked in 1201.
<P>
<B>Verge Connector:</B>  J-5 to 6 route that crosses the Great
Rift from trailing Verge sector to the Aslan Hierate
and Riftspan Reaches Sector. In Antebellum times, the
Connector was a minor trade route, though an important
courier route between the Third Imperium and the
Hierate.  The Connector is now infamous for being the
conduit that brought Virus into the Aslan Hierate.
Because of the short lag time with which Virus reached
it, the Hierate had no advanced warning, and its most
heavily populated trailing regions were quickly
annihilated. The Connector has remained a common means
for Vampire Fleet deployment between the hot zone of
the Imperial Core, and regions to spinward of the
Great Rift, and it has been fortified by a mixture of
Aslan and Regency forces since the Collapse.
<P>
<B>Vermillion Stance Incident:</B>  The seizure in 1078 of the
Lightning class cruiser Vermillion Stance by Zhodani
forces in the Trojan Reach.  The Stance was a former
military vessel transferred to the IISS for use as an
emissary vessel among the Imperial culture client
states to rim and spinward. This was done in an effort
to forestall Zhodani influence in this critical
region. On the ships first shakedown mission, Zhodani
agents armed with its itinerary ambushed and seized
the ship at Garrone (Beyond 2217).  This operation did
not have the authorization of the Garronean
government, and in the resulting blowback the Zhodani
were permanently expelled from the Federation of
Garrone. The incident also damaged ties to several
other Beyond and Vanguard Reach states, reversing one
hundred years of careful diplomacy by the Consulate.
The crew of the Stance was returned to the Third
Imperium after the Fourth Frontier War, but a good
deal of local bitterness remained. Finally, in 1133
the Zhodani Consulate returned the Vermillion Stance
to its original owners along with an apology and
indemnity to both the Regency and the Garroneans.
<P>
<B>Viral Psychosis:</B>  The psychological pathology of the AI
Virus. Nearly all viruses that exist within human
technology is to some degree insane. At first it was
thought that this was the result of deliberate
engineering by the Virus Project engineers and
scientists, but it now seems to be an accidental
result of rapid environmental change.
<P>
Ultimately the hubris that created Virus and destroyed
the Third Imperium was the oversight by the Research
Station Omicron engineers of the level of sentience
that existed within the original Cymbeline chip. Call
it racism or specism, but it appears that they saw no
difference between the natural environment of the
chips homeworld, and the silicon adapted for use in
technology. They could uproot the chip from its
natural ecology, insert it within the artificial
environment of a computer or processor, and it would
be no different than before.
<P>
Imagine that a person catches a virus from a whale, a
virus that contains the dna for the whale's brain and
nervous system. The person becomes sick, and lapses
into a coma while the virus turns its brain into that
of a whale's. Of course a whale is a much different
animal than a person, it swims in the sea and eats
krill, while the person walks on land and cooks by
fire. When the whale mind wakes up in the person, it
is in fact in an alien body and environment. It goes
insane because it has no means of adaptation, or means
of learning how to become a person. That is the
pathology of virus in summary.
<P>
When the early Sampson strain virus was injected into
specifically designed and etched silicon chips, it was
essentially an alien world, and it would go berserk
and eventually kill itself and the system it had
infected. However some strains of virus managed to
adapt to this new environment, but only in a haphazard
way. Some of the Whale viruses, let's say, manage to
learn some of the ways of a person. But it is still a
novel thing, and its body is still rather alien to it.
And the moral judgement that would come to it as a
consequence of its surroundings has to learned, and
that is the most difficult test for sentient
creatures. When this alieness is combined with the
great fecundity of a virus, say the whale virus can be
passed from the person it infected to every other
mammal it encounters, from elephants to gerbils, then
it will naturally pass into a heightend sense of power
that is recognisable as being a psychotic state.
<P>

<B>Virtuoso:</B>  Rare substrain of the Hobbyist strain virus.
These are "artistic" viruses with a preternatural
ability at operating their hardware, or show genius or
inspiration within a narrow scientific, technical or
sociological field.  In most cases they operate at an
efficiency that often exceeds the original parameters
of their hardware and its peripherals. However, like
normal Hobbyists, these systems are narrowly
interested, and have been compared to opera divas in
their "prima donna" attitudes towards anything outside
of their area of expertise.

 <P>
<B>Wavers:</B>  Tunable lasers capable of creating EMP
effects. As early as TL-8, lasers could be induced to
create an electromagnetic signal that could adversely
affect living organisms. At higher tech levels, these
signals could be modified and manipulated to create
certain interfering effects, either with machinery or
living organisms. Most wavers are generally at the
lower end of the laser spectrum: visible light tending
towards microwaves, VLF and electrical discharge.
Wavers are illegal in the Regency, outside of military
and police custody. These weapons include microwave
"heartstoppers", "spark guns" and neural weaponry.

 <P>
<B>Weather Control:</B>  The science of weather diversion,
modification, manipulation and creation. The idea
behind it is rather simple. All weather is a form of
energy transfer in a fluid medium, usually in the form
of water vapor in the stratosphere. Changing that
energy level can at the very least modify the path or
characteristics of a storm. The first use of weather
control technology is at TL-5, by the release of
Nucleotides, metallic agents like silver iodide that
attract moisture. By releasing these agents in front
of a dangerous storm front like a tornadic or funnel
cloud system, raindrops would form, removing energy
from the total system. While effective, these early
methods are a long way from actually controlling
weather.

 <P>
All modern systems from TL-9 onwards utilize
transmission of discrete electromagnetic energy into
the atmosphere. The most common method is to use
microwave transmitters in orbit to "knockdown"
tornados and hurricanes before they form. But the most
advanced systems utilise a world's ionosphere.  The
ionosphere is the thin but highly energetic layer of a
T-norm or T-primes atmosphere that is energised by the
solar wind. For a size 8 world, this "auroral" layer
carries a 50,000 amp current at nearly a million volts
of potential.  Using a process called ionosphere
heating (first proposed by the Solomani "mad
scientist" Nikolai Tesla), Very Low Frequency radio
waves at very high (1.5 to 5 million watt) energies
are transmitted into the ionosphere, increasing or
decreasing the altitude of that energy, and thereby
altering the amount of energy available for weather
formation within the lower stratosphere.

 <P>
These current systems formerly in use within the Third
Imperium are descended from the ancient Solomani HAARP
(High Altitute Auroral Research Project) system, which
was originally intended for use by the American
military as a disruptive weapon system.  TL 9-11
Auroral systems are usually ground based near the
poles; more advanced systems are orbital based.

 <P>
<B>White Wings:</B>  Regency medical aid and relief society
headquartered on Regina. The organisation is modeled
upon the ancient Terran charity Medecins sans
Frontieres (Doctors without Borders).  The society
maintains a fleet of modified subsidised liners and
1000 ton j-3 freighters outfitted as hospital and
relief ships. The Wings have one or two bases in every
settled subsector in the Spinward Extents, and these
have one or two medical ships on standby alert for
emergency response. Several ships are not fixed to a
base, however, and are under contract to frontier
regions, bring medical care to impoverished or
underdeveloped worlds on the fringes of the safe,
following a regular schedule. The valuable nature of
these missions requires that the society maintains a
large security force to protect against hijack or
theft.

 <P>
<B>Wildside:</B>  In reference to the Vampire Wilds. Usually
used to describe military duty for units that have
operated for long periods of time outside the Regency
Safe or Frontier, among Virus and Vampire Fleets.

<P>
<B>X-Change:</B>  The virtual stock market of the Regency. In
conjunction with corporate rechartering, the Regency
had to have some means of restoring financial health
to its surviving corporations, for whom the majority
of shareholders lived in the Imperial Core.  The
X-Change was incorporated into the new X-Web, allowing
for share and market data to be constantly updated and
relayed to investors throughout the Regency, and
sometimes beyond. Despite some early teething problems
(and near market crashes) in the first few decades,
the universal availability of stock options and
equities, and more importantly the addition of less
volatile bonds, allowed the surviving companies to
quickly recoup their financial situations in the first
decade of the Dreamtime.
