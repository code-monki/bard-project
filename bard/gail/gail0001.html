The
<!A HREF="../hana/hana####.html">Scout Service</A>
of the
<!A HREF="../hana/hana####.html">Last Imperium</A> had two primary
functions: exploratin and communications. The purpose of
exploration is clearly substantiated by the huge number
of relic
<!A HREF="sara####.html">Scout/Couriers</A>. So whatever happened
to all of the
<!A HREF="sara####.html">X-Boats</A> and their
<!A HREF="sara####.html">Tenders</A>?<P>

First of all, the
<!A HREF="sara####.html">X-Boats</A> and
<!A HREF="sara####.html">Tenders</A> had massive amounts of
electronics (as befits a moile communications post). Thus, they
were greatly susceptible to
<!A HREF="../hana/hana####.html">Virus</A> infestation. In fact, a
major avenue of
<!A HREF="../hana/hana####.html">Virus</A> propagation was the
<!A HREF="../hana/hana####.html">X-Boat Network</A>. Therefore,
the majority of
<!A HREF="sara####.html">X-Boats</A> and
<!A HREF="sara####.html">Tenders</A> were casualties to
<!A HREF="../hana/hana####.html">Virus</A>. But that still leaves
us with a large number of
<!A HREF="sara####.html">X-Boats</A> and a lesser number of
<!A HREF="sara####.html">Tenders</A> to account for.<P>

In the Post-Collapse universe, most
<!A HREF="sara####.html">X-Boats</A> will be greatly valued as
reserves of spare parts (just as the
<!A HREF="../????/????####.html">Covenant of Sufren</A> is doing
with the jump drives from its larger naval vessels). However, a
pocket empire might maintain one or two
<!A HREF="sara####.html">X-Boats</A> as a special high-jump courier.
<!A HREF="sara####.html">Tenders</A>, on the other hand, will
probably be used as fuel shuttles (with their hangar bay
reconfigured as extra fuel tankage). While you consider the
implications of this, let me bring up something else.<P>

A major problem faced by the Reformation Coalition is the
restriction on travel within the RC imposed by the
astrography. For example, for a typical jump-2 ship (such
as a
<!A HREF="sara####.html">far trader</A> or a
<!A HREF="sara####.html">scout/courier</A>) takes eight jumps to
travel from
<!A HREF="../opal/opal####.html">Oriflamme</A> to
<!A HREF="../opal/opal####.html">Spencer</A> (see
<A HREF="#FIG1">figure 1</A> below), crossing the RC border to do
so, even though
<!A HREF="../opal/opal####.html">Spencer</A> was only three
parsecs away!  If the same ship goes from
<!A HREF="../opal/opal####.html">Baldur</A> to
<A HREF="../opal/opal1000.html">Helios</A>, the trip involves four
jumps, again crossnig the RC border, and again the destination
was only three parsecs away. Going from
<!A HREF="../opal/opal####.html">Nike Nimbus</A> to the RC Navy HQ at
<!A HREF="../opal/opal####.html">Aurora</A> takes four jumps, once
again crossing the RC border (but this time, our destination was
four parsecs away). What does this have to do with relic X-Boat
Tenders?<P>

Suppose the RC Navy were to commission two squadrons (with one
Tender [
<A HREF="../sara/sara9000.html">Tanker version</A>] each) to service
deep-space refueling depots. One squadron ("Sahara Squadron")
would be based out of
<!A HREF="../opal/opal####.html">Baldur</A> and would service 0833
and 1034. The other ("Gobi Squadron") would be based out of
<!A HREF="../opal/opal####.html">Shenandoah</A> and would service
0938 and 1137. From 0833, Sahara Squadron would connect
<!A HREF="../opal/opal####.html">Kruyter</A>,
<!A HREF="../opal/opal####.html">Eos</A>,
<!A HREF="../opal/opal####.html">Nike Nimbus</A>,
<!A HREF="../opal/opal####.html">Enkidu</A>, and
<!A HREF="../opal/opal####.html">Baldur</A> (see
<A HREF="#FIG2">figure 2</A> below); from 1034, Sahara Squadron
would connect
<!A HREF="../opal/opal####.html">Baldur</A>,
<A HREF="../opal/opal1000.html">Helios</A>,
<!A HREF="../opal/opal####.html">Oriflamme</A>,
<!A HREF="../opal/opal####.html">Spires</A>, and
<!A HREF="../opal/opal####.html">Zloga</A>. From 0938, Gobi
Squadron would connect
<!A HREF="../opal/opal####.html">Aubaine</A>,
<A HREF="../opal/opal2000.html">Phoebus</A>,
<!A HREF="../opal/opal####.html">Spires</A>,
<!A HREF="../opal/opal####.html">Lucifer</A>, and
<!A HREF="../opal/opal####.html">Shenandoah</A>; from 1137, Gobi
Squadron would connect
<!A HREF="../opal/opal####.html">Oriflamme</A>,
<!A HREF="../opal/opal####.html">Spires</A>,
<!A HREF="../opal/opal####.html">Zloga</A>, and
<!A HREF="../opal/opal####.html">Shenandoah</A>. Also, within each
squadron, both deep-space refueling locations would be within
jump-2 distance of one another. Thus, someone wanting to go from
<!A HREF="../opal/opal####.html">Oriflamme</A> to
<!A HREF="../opal/opal####.html">Eos</A> could do so in just three
jumps!<P>

Initially, each deep-space refueling site would be built
from the following
<!A HREF="sara####.html">Clipper</A> Modules :<P>

<UL>
<LI>1x <!A HREF="sara####.html">25-ton Lifeboat Module</A> (for the emergenct low berths
     and the radio)
<LI>1x <!A HREF="sara####.html">25-ton Missile Module</A> (for self-defense as well as
     for the Active and Passive EMS arrays)
<LI>2x <!A HREF="sara####.html">25-ton VIP Quarters Modules</A> (for accomodations)
<LI>1x <!A HREF="sara####.html">50-ton Service Module</A> for 10-ton Small Craft (for
     the skiff and the machine shop)
<LI>4x <!A HREF="sara####.html">100-ton Fuel Modules</A> (for fuel tankage)
</UL>
<BR>

Eventually, each site would replace the
<!A HREF="sara####.html">Small Craft Service Module<A> and both of the
<!A HREF="sara####.html">VIP Quarters Modules</A> with a
<!A HREF="sara####.html">200-ton Quarters Module Mk IIa</A> (for
the rec deck, the radio, the sickbay, and the skiff); furthermore,
each site would get an additional 6
<!A HREF="sara####.html">100-ton Fuel Modules</A> (bringing the
total number of such Fuel Modules per site to ten each).
Initially, both Squadrons would have only one
<A HREF="sara9000.html">Tanker</A> each to service both of their
deep-space sites; eventually, another two
<A HREF="sara9000.html">Tankers</A> (one per Squadron) should be
assigned. The eight-week schedule for both Squadrons would look
like this:<P>
