<B>Amygdala:</B> 1. Almond shaped organ found in the
forebrain of all Humaniti. Its purpose is the
processing of threats or danger, and regulates the
production of stimulant hormones like adrenalin. The
amygdala also regulates neurotransmitter production,
and has an important role in psionics. 2. A wild
psion. In some rare cases, the Amygdala can be
hyperactive, and create an overproduction of
neurotransmitters. This can create psions with little
or no control over their powers. In most cases
Amygdala psions generate a permanent energy field
around themselves that can manifest as random
telepathic or telekinetic activity.  Amygdalas are
thought to be a major reason behind antipsion
prejudice and fear, and accordingly are treated in
contemporary Regency and Zhodani society with
medication and special training.
<P>
<B>Avernus:</B> 1. Name of volcanic crater lake in the
Campania region of Italy on Terra. In the period of
Classical Greece and Rome it was thought to be an
entranceway into the underworld. 2. Avernus/Usani
(Deneb 2027), a mysterious world that was first
inhabited by Ziru Sirka colonists around -2200, now
long since vanished. The Vilani constructed several
bizarre graveyards on a plateau located on the world's
northern continent, consisting of ornate but empty
mausoleums. The only passable land trail up the slope
to the site passes through a bizarre, tunnel like
building, which is guarded by the "Burning Man" a bas
relief figure, vaguely human and set in a crucifixion
pose, surrounding by a billowing red robe or flames.
<P>
<B>Blacklight Plot of 1180:</B> Attempted coup d'etat by
reactionary elements in the Regency nobility and
military. Led by a member of a Tukera family cadet
branch, a cabal of officers attempted to organise a
mutiny among members of the 125th and 257th fleets in
an attempt to coerce Regent Seldrian and the Regency
Senate in repudiating political reforms carried out by
her father, most notably the Representational Reforms.
The nobles had the backing of many noncoms whose
families had been displaced or unemployed by the
liquidation of noble owned businesses and properties.
But the actual popular support in the ranks was
overestimated by the plotters, and the coup was
quickly broken up and its ringmasters arrested by
Regency security services. Several participants went
underground, aided by the Flame of Purity movement,
which was radicalised by the incident.
<P>
<B>Church of Stellar Divinity:</B> Ziru Sirka religion
founded in -3883. The CSD is an animistic religion
that worships stars as the repositories of divine will
and conciousness. In its main form the CSD is typical
of Vilani religions, carefully balancing religious
mythos with the rational logos demanded of the Vilani
by their consensus based society. The idea of god
being the local star is a rather rational idea,
finding inspiration in both stellar science and
romantic idealisation. The religions main attraction
is its daffy devotion to its mythos, and its close
knit communitarianism and willingness to adopt
believers from any social strata.
<P>
Its main raison d'etre is the attempt to explain the
universe, and the individuals place in it as a kind of
interactive monotheism. God/Nature created the
universe along rational lines, with the brightest part
of its nature acting as the center of all life,
providing gravity and heat for incipient solar
systems. Because evil and deviance tends to be posited
outside the tight-knit Vilani community, or ignored
completely where their culture predominates, the CSD
theology is rather inadequate in describing or dealing
with it. As long as the rituals are followed, and
people are pure in heart, the light of a star will
forever fill the vacuum and deny the emptiness of the
void.
<P>
CSD blends both science and religion to an incredible
degree, though both actually suffer from a careless
attempt at cross-assimilation. For example the idea of
a Black Hole is a rather difficult one for its
theology. And the idea of a "Cosmic Whimper" in which
stars are only a temporary phenomenon before cosmic
expansion makes new stellar formation impossible is
heretical. Increasingly the church has had to turn its
back on new astronomical discovery in order to
maintain its orthodoxy. Its own internal politics and
conflicts are therefore arcane and even postively
ridiculous, as the "Pavabidian Heresy" clearly
demonstrates.
<P>
The CSD was a minority religion in the old Ziru Sirka,
mostly popular in the coreward extents of the old
empire, congregating in large numbers near large stars
like Beta Pyxidis and Antares. Almost driven into
oblivion by the influx of Solomani religions after the
Terran's conquest of the First Imperium, it barely
survived the Long Night. After the founding of the
Third Imperium it found new support and rational in
the new order, attracting new followers on many worlds
in the expanding Imperial frontier. Many of these
communities found homes in the Domain of Deneb, though
few dominated a world like the Pavabid branch of the
church did. Many of its communities made themselves
indespensable to the Third Imperium by working in
important industries or running important facilities
along the made communication lines. Since the Collapse
the religion is a waning though still powerful force
where its communities have survived.
<P>
<B>Cold Jupiter:</B> A gas giant that forms in the outer
reaches of a solar system. The customary planet
thought by people when they hear the term gas giant.
Nearly all gas giants are of this type, having first
formed well away from a primary star where their
gravity allows them to accrete the material necessary
to survive the abrasive nature of the solar wind.
<P>
Many Cold Jupiters actually form outside of a solar
system, as they are not reliant upon a primary star
for their formation. Most such gas giants wander
freely across the interstellar void, their internal
heat preventing them from freezing over. These are
referred to as EGGS (Extrasolar Gas Giants). When they
form within a solar system, cometary collisions
increase or decrease their orbital velocities over
time, bringing them farther or closer to a star. Where
most habitable worlds exist, it is because a Cold
Jupiter's gravity vacuumed up most loose outer system
debris and comets, preventing frequent collisions with
the inner system worlds. Where no gas giants exist
near a habitable world, it is thought that giants once
existed in the far outer system and were eventually
lost to interstellar space.
<P>
<B>Colors and Symbols, Regency:</B> The Regency government
has retained the Imperial tradition of inclusion by
having no official color for the government and/or
state functions or emblems. The only addition to the
old Imperial Sunburst has been the inclusion of the
"Bridled Steed" of the Spinward Marches, and the old
symbol of the Domain of Deneb. The "Burning Horse" was
first introduced on the Lightning Class cruiser
Arrival Vengeance in 1127, following its sucessful
return from the Imperial Core.
<P>
The Regency Military has incorporated some changes in
its official colors since the Collapse in an effort to
seperate its units from invading Vampires. Before the
Collapse the Domain of Deneb Navy painted its ships
with a Blue-Gray or aquamarine color scheme with light
gray or cream highlights. After the Rape of Trin, its
frontline ships wear navy blue with gold and black
highlights, a scheme adopted in the general issue
Class A Naval uniform. Reserve fleets use a emerald
green scheme, again with gold and black highlights.
Planetary units on long-term assignment with the
Regency Fleet use black with gold and crimsom.
<P>
The Army uses the Regency Sunburst with a Shield
device as its symbol. Its official colors are a light
green with gold braiding or piping. For ceremonial
purposes vehicles sport a Green and Gold scheme,
though for field duties their chameleon suites adjust
accordingly to local terrain and vegetation to provide
suitable camoflauge. The Marines use the Regency
Sunburst with a Sword. Their official colors are
Maroon and Gold, and all vehicles, including many in
active service, sport this scheme as well. The Marines
have discontinued the issuance of the special parade
ground "Maroon" ceremonial battle dress for logistical
and morale reasons. Army and Marine reserve and
roundout units use frontline uniforms, but their
equipment is usually Dark Gray or Tan.
<P>
The Regency Quarantine Service sets the Bridled Steed
against a Starburst surrounded by twelve stars as its
symbol. Its inspection ships are always identifiable
by high visibility red and yellow color schemes;
patrol ships are usually painted a "gunmetal gray" for
low visibility. The RQS uniform is a simple dark blue
tunic with white and light green piping. The Regency
Interstellar Scout Service paints its patrol and scout
ships in a silver or tan scheme without much
ornamentation, but its X-boats and tenders are usually
"barber striped" in red and white or the yellow and
black "yellowjacket" scheme. Scout personnel still
wear the plain blue or gray jumpsuit worn by Imperial
scouts for centuries.
<P>
<B>Emerald City:</B> Popular nickname given to
Vincennes/Vincennes by Regency citizens. The
implication of the world as a magical place or arsenal
of eldritch is actually resented by most citizens of
the world.
<P>
<B>Fishbowl Effect:</B> The unusual economic advantage
provided by small, airless rockball worlds. The lack
of gravity and interfering fluids make heavy
manufacturing on such worlds more cost effective than
on more habitable worlds. The term comes from the fact
that such a world can be treated like a huge
megastructure, rather than just a cold lump of rock.
In low gravity large scale construction and huge
industries can be built, and the normal costs of
geography safely ignored.
<P>
<B>Flame of Purity:</B> Regency terrorist movement, formerly
a popular conservative movement. It was founded by
conservative nobles in 1135 to better prepare the
Regency for the coming onslaught of Virus. Through
popular clubs and membership drives it enlisted tens
of millions of Regency citizens, and operated
education programs that disseminated information about
Virus and increased popular support for the new
Regency government. But it soon became disenchanted
with Norris' liberal reforms and unwillingness to back
traditional Imperial repression of Pro-democracy
movements like the Ine Givar. It also became a
rallying point for Exterminationists and hardline
elements of the Regency military. After it tried to
coopt Norris' Flame imagery, and began creating armed
cells in resistance to the Representational Reforms,
the group was outlawed, and became the main resistance
to reform. As the Representational Reforms became more
popular, the movement lost most of its public support,
and it became increasingly violent. The failed
Blacklight Plot exposed many of its primary members,
and arrests and executions marginalised it further.
The group has toned down its violent rhetoric in
recent years, though its alliance with some members of
the Vargr Pack have become worrisome.
<P>
<h4>Fleets of the Midway</h4>
<P>
<B>23rd Fleet (Axemen):</B> The Rhylanor subsector fleet
recieved its moniker during the Fifth Frontier War for
its actions in helping cut off the main Zhodani
salient. Like most interior fleets, the 23rd is
largely defensive in equipment and tactics, though in
this case it has a large number of vital industrial
worlds in its area of responsibility.
<P>
<B>88th Fleet (Eight Ball):</B> The Spinward Marches Swing
Fleet is based in Lanth Subsector, but its past
deployments have mostly carried it into the Midway to
back up fleets summoned to fight Vampire incursions.
<P>
<B>195th Fleet (Stronghearts):</B> The Sabine Subsector fleet
saw extensive action against the Zhodani during the
Fifth Frontier War, helping to shield Rhylanor and
Mora from Zhodani raiders and deep penetration units.
It also fought at the Battle of Rhylanor, and became
famed for its resolve despite heavy resistance. The
worlds of Sabine are more fractious than most, and its
units spent a great deal of effort to preserve
internal peace during the antebellum period.
<P>
<B>257th Fleet (Elohim):</B> The Inar subsector fleet is a
heavyweight unit. Besides being tasked to defend Deneb
Depot Alpha, it is the primary backstop for Lamas,
Antra and Namidshur fleets, owing to the lack of
adequate basing facilities and the presence of large
Vampire threats. Depot Alpha's extensive facilities
make up for this, and boosts the fleets units with new
build warships and supply/support ships. Because of
lingering Imperial nostalgia on Depot Alpha, it is the
most contaminated with reactionary political
sentiments. Elohim units are carefully watched lest
they attempt another Blacklight Plot.
<P>
<B>258th Fleet (Seraphim):</B> The Vincennes subsector fleet
is the best equipped after the 43rd. Its proximity to
TL-16 manufacturing facilities on Vincennes and Dekha
gives first choice for new advanced ships and
equipment. It has also seen considerable action on the
Deneb Front. Unfortunately its prestige and
effectiveness has been blunted by continuing
controversy between Dekha and Vincennes over the
construction of new naval bases among the high
population worlds of the subsector. The Regency
proposed to build one such facility in 1142, but
squabbles over who would obtain the facility has kept
it from being built. Current facilities in the
subsector are insufficient and overloaded, and the
Seraphim and its people are frustrated at the paradox
of possessing the latest technology, and the worst of
housing and base facilities.
<P>
<h4>Fleets of the Stronghold</h4>
<P>
<B>19th Fleet (Tsunami):</B> The Vestus subsector fleet is
heavily involved in frontline military operations
against Virus. Because of its access to TL-15 and 16
material coming out of Lintl's factories, the fleet
often tries out new military hardware on forays into
the Great Rift or the Wilds. The Tsunami gets its name
from the sheer heaviness of its units; while most
Regency fleets have doubled in size since the
Collapse, the 19th has an unprecedented 20 BatRons and
CruRons in unmixed squadrons, as opposed to the more
common mixed LineRons, ScreenRons or SuitRons that is
the current norm for the Regency Navy. The reason for
this heavy makeup has never been explained, though a
large number of heavy capital units pass quickly to
other fleets, so it may be a primary training and
shakeout facility. Given the fleets close proximity to
the Spinward Defense Complex, this seems likely.
<P>
<B>43rd Fleet (Regency Guard):</B> The storied 43rd Fleet
protects Mora and the Regency government. It is often
considered to be the last line of defense in case of a
Viral breakthrough on the Frontier. It is not the most
elite of all the fleets however, as the Frontier gets
first pick on promising personnel. The Guard is at
most above average, though it gets first pick of new
TL-16 ships and material, and is a showcase for
Regency military technology.
<P>
<B>74th Fleet (Twilight Riders):</B> RQD 5 and Macon
Subsector fleet. Heavily engaged in fighting Vampires
that cross the Rift from trailing Reft sector, or from
Corridor. Like most frontier fleets, the Riders have
more squadrons than the norm, but the problems of
operations in the Rift means less emphasis is placed
on heavy capitol ships.
<P>
<B>128th Fleet (Ancient Mariners):</B> Defending Usher
subsector and the vast region of RQD 5A, it has been
the 128th's lot to defend against most Vampire
incursions into the Rift, and at the same time
maintain the peace within the Islands. Like the 74th,
the 128th is a larger but lighter squadron. Most of
its ships are craft like the Kishikhaniir Rift Cruiser
(CJ-15) which sacrifice acceleration for long
endurance. Most of the fleets units are centered in
the Islands, and its personnel have generally better
relations with the locals than the local RQS cadres.
Where the Rocks are concerned with defending the
Regency safe against Islander perfidy, the Islands are
the main responsibility of the Ancient Mariners, and
they are less judgemental of their charges.
<P>
<B>154th Fleet (Spectral Fire):</B> The 154th Fleet and its
personnel has had a love-hate relationship with
Deneb's religious government. The 154th incorporates
the "Burning Man" of Avernus into its official
insignia, imagery that the Willies claim to be
sacreligious and offensive. And the fleet has had
several run-ins with fundamentalists among the Flower
of the One, the fundamentalist military arm of To Will
One Thing, who seems to be unnecessarily activist in
helping defend the Frontier, especially those worlds
with active missionary ministries. The 154th is second
only to its neighbor the 183rd in the number of
battles and engagements fought against Virus. This is
quite a change from its prewar role as a transport and
logistics support for the Marches, and it is now
considered to be an cherry posting.
<P>
<B>196th Fleet (Keystone):</B> The 196th has mostly been a
training and logistics fleet before the Collapse.
Assigned to the backwater Star Lane subsector, the
fleet was considered to be too far away from any
potential trouble spots to be of much effectiveness.
Its line units did engage the Zhodani in the last
Frontier War, but it never rose above a second tier
supply rating in the entire antebellum period. The
fleet retains its lower rating, but it now must
actively work as a facilitator of fleet movements from
the Marches to Deneb, and vice versa. Most of its
bases are located in the rimward portion of Star Lane,
where it backs up the Rift fleets.
<P>
<B>207th Fleet (The Ronin):</B> The Trin's Shroud subsector
fleet have never forgotten, and have never
forgiven.... themselves that is. The personnel of the
207th wear their disgrace openly, taking on an air of
self-castigation for their failure to protect Trin
from the depredations of the Kishkii. Today the Ronin
preside over a subsector still reeling from the
effects of 1139. Trin is centuries away from recovery,
and the subsector economy and population are still
well below that before the Rape. To their credit its
officers and and rank and file do not pine for the
unrecoverable past, but they are not necessarily
pleased with the present or the forseeable future. The
fleet is vehemently vengeful about its losses, and its
past commanders have aggressively sought out
operations on the front against Virus. But privately
the personnel of the 207th believe that nothing more
than the complete extermination of Virus would expunge
their dishonor. Needless to say the unit is a hotbed
of Exterminationist fervor, and many Flame of Purity
terrorists have emerged from its ranks.
<P>
<B>260th Fleet (Trailblazers):</B> The Zeng Subsector fleet
has been heavily engaged against Vampires for the last
seventy years. The Trailblazers defend a section of
strategic naval bases that anchor the trailing to
coreward kink along the periphery of the Rift.
Vampires have attempted to overrun these bases on
several occasions, and the battles for Ibsen, Balzac
and Jecife have been bloody fleet brawls. But where it
has triumped against silicon enemies from beyond, it
has had a much harder time securing the peace against
the domestic squabbles that have rent Zeng in the last
quarter century. The fleet has a very large TL-16
arsenal, courtesy of the efforts of Depot Beta and
Lilad, but the current troubles on the latter world
has analysts worried about the supply of crucial
components to the fleet.
<P>
<B>303rd Fleet (Valkyries):</B> The Gulf Subsector fleet is
primarily tasked as a reserve force in case of a major
incursion by an enemy into the Regency. This function
is due to the large number of vessels made available
to the fleet by the Spinward Defense Complex. In the
antebellum period the Valkyries were more concerned
with weapon testing and training. After the Battle of
Furens, it underwent a major reorganisation. In
conjunction with the 2nd Experimental Fleet, it trains
constantly against simulated Vampire Fleets, and its
methods are so good that it is an advanced training
school for recently graduated line officers. The
Valkyries often deploy to the Frontier for shakedown
cruises, and its units have seen considerable action.
<P>
<B>Fluidic Atmospheres:</B> Any atmosphere of habitable
composition (N2, O2, H2O) that exists at pressures or
densities much greater than normal. In most cases the
pressure is so great that the atmosphere will liquify
at lower altitudes, creating metastable gas oceans of
various compositions. The development of such an
atmosphere is still poorly understood by
planetologists, but most theories postulate that these
worlds are either failed gas giants because of too
much metal in their cores, or simply metal cored
worlds that developed in areas in the nebular cloud
where they could accrete gas from the surrounding
space in very large quantities. Because of the high
pressures, which can be high as those found at an
ocean depth of 3000 meters, vehicles and structures
must be heavily shielded in to safely operate in these
atmospheres. Only a handful of races, including most
notably the Virushi, can breathe at their lower
altitudes without mechanical aid. Pressures at high
altitudes can be breathed by humans with a minimum of
acclimitization, and it is possible than human
populations may have survived on these worlds in the
Wilds.
<P>
<B>Force Multiplier:</B>  Any factor or advantage that
improves the chances of a military force in open
battle. This multiplies the ratio as per Lancaster's
Rule. <P>

<B>Geode:</B> The shape and form of a planet and its surface.
The actual physical form of a planet is rather
flexible, and can be flexed by gravitational, tectonic
or geothermal effects. Most molten core T-Norm ot
T-Prime planets are bulging elliptical spheres, rather
than perfectly circular, due to rotational effects.
Many gas giant moons are distorted by gravitational
pressure, and even geologically dead worlds are often
disfigured by major collisions or resurfacing by
meteoritic strikes.
<P>
<B>Hot Jupiter:</B> A gas giant that forms or moves near a
star. Hot Jupiters are violent worlds, wracked with
massive internal storms created by the high amounts of
solar radiation their atmospheres trap. Even more than
the usual gas giant, they have violent updrafts of
heated gas and melted silica from accreted meteors or
comets. The presence of such a world almost guarantees
the lack of any habitable worlds, as their elliptical
orbits cause them to eject smaller free floating
planets out of the solar system. Nor are they good
places for frontier refuelling, as the violent storms,
the constant rain of silica and the presence of acidic
nitrous and sulfurous compounds in their upper
atmospheres make them dangerous to passing ships.
<P>
<B>Lancaster's Rule:</B> Rule of thumb regulating military
casualties. According to this rule, the ratio of
casualties suffered by opposing forces, assuming that
all combatants have the ability to fire at the
opposing side and are in the open and armed with
weapons of like technology, is the factor of the ratio
of forces engaged in battle between the two sides,
squared. Hence if one force is twice the size of its
opponent, under these circumstances they will inflict
four times as many casualties on the smaller force
than they suffer in return.  The ratio can be modified
by mitigating factors as terrain, fortifications,
technological superiority, force or TO&E composition,
dispersal and/or concentration, and intelligence. But
the casualties remain the square of the force
multiplied ratio. Named after an ancient British
Solomani scholar.
<P>
<B>Lilad Devolution:</B> The evacuation of people and
materials from Lilad/Zeng under the spectre of looming
intercommunal warfare. Millions of professional people
are fleeing the world for less heavily populated
systems nearby, and the more adventurous are
organising colonial missions to resettle habitable
worlds in the Frontier or the Wilds.
