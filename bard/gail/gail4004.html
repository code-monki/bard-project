<h3>1.0  New/Revised Skills and Cascades </h3>

<B>Armed Martial Arts (STR) -- Melee</B>:  This cascade skill now has the 
additional new cascade Other.  <P>

<UL>
 <LI> Other:  This cascade covers all unusual or exotic melee weapons not 
    covered by the "usual" cascades of Armed M.A., from a barbarian 
    warrior's shield to an adventuring archeologist's bullwhip, and 
    anything in between.  This cascade *cannot* be the primary cascade 
    of this skill; a character wanting such a specialization may, at the 
    GM's discretion, declare a *specific* weapon type to be the primary 
    cascade, but in such an instance, that specific weapon type becomes 
    its own cascade of this skill.  <P>

    (Example): Dr. Montana Smith is an expert with the bullwhip.  
    Assuming he has level 8 with this weapon, it would be recorded as 
    "Armed Martial Arts (Special -- Bullwhip) 8," with the cascades 
    Large Blade, Small Blade, Club, Polearm, and Other being level 4 
    (default).  <P>

</UL>

<B>Unarmed Martial Arts (STR) -- Melee</B>:  This skill is now a cascade skill.  
The cascades are Block, Strike, and Throw.  <p>
<UL>

<LI> Block:  This cascade covers martial blocks, dodges, and evades.  <p>

<li> Strike:  This cascade covers martial punches, kicks, and strikes.  <p>

<LI> Throw:  This cascade covers martial throws and grapples.  <p>
</UL>
<h3>2.0  New Combat Maneuvers </h3>

<B>Disarm</B>:  This is a Formidable test of Armed Martial Arts; if the target
character is using a two-handed weapon, the Disarm attempt becomes
Impossible.  <p>
<UL>
  <LI> Outstanding Success:  The target character loses his weapon unless 
    he succeeds at a Formidable test of STR.  <P>

  <LI> Success:  The target character loses his weapon unless he succeeds 
    at a Difficult test of STR.  <P>

  <LI> Failure:  The Disarm attempt fails.  <P>

<LI> Catastrophic Failure:  The Disarm attempt fails.  <P>
</UL>
<B>Feint</B>:  This is a Difficult test of both Acting and (Armed/Unarmed) 
Martial Arts ("Armed M. A." if melee combat; "Unarmed M. A. if HTH 
combat).  <p>
<UL>
  <LI> Outstanding Success:  The target character has a penalty of +1 
    Difficulty Level to avoid the character's next attack this turn 
    (e.g., +1 Diff. Level to Avoid Leaping Kick if next attack is 
    Leaping Kick, etc.).  <P>

  <LI> Success:  Same effect as Outstanding Success above, unless the target 
    character succeeds at a Difficult test of both Observation and (Armed/ 
    Unarmed) Martial Arts.  <P>

  <LI> Failure:  No effect.  <P>

  <LI> Catastrophic Failure:  The attacking character has given *himself* 
    the penalty that the target character would have gotten from 
    Outstanding Success above.  <P>
</UL>
<B>Shield Block</B>:  This is an Average test of the Other cascade of Armed 
Martial Arts (exception: a character who chose to specify "Shield" as 
a specific non-standard weapon may use that special cascade instead).  
The character must be using a medium-sized shield (about a meter wide); 
smaller shields ("bucklers") must instead be used as melee weapons 
performing the standard maneuver Block.  Unlike other maneuvers in melee 
combat, Shield Block is a *free* maneuver (i.e., it doesn't count against 
the character's Initiative-based limits on actions).  <p>
<UL>

<LI> Outstanding Success:  Anyone trying to attack this character in 
    melee combat has a penalty of +1 Difficulty Level.  <p>

<LI> Success:  Same effect as Outstanding Success above. <p>

<LI>Failure:  No effect.  <p>

<LI>Catastrophic Failure:  The defending character cannot make an attack 
    this turn.
