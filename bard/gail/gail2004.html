<h3>Pretoria Subsector</h3>  Pretoria was originally
settled by Vilani colonists in the early days of the
Third Imperium. Many of these were established in the
shadows of earlier, First Imperium era, colonies that
for the most part failed or perished after being cut
off from the empire by Vargr raiders. The Vilani were
supplemented by a heavy influx of Solomani nobles and
their retainers in the aftermath of the Alkhalikoi
Ascension. Many of these were nobles exiled for
disloyalty or being troublemakers, but in a wry twist
upon the "divide et impera" doctrine, they were given
mostly Vilani subjects to rule.  This act of political
perversity created nothing but misery for the
subsector in the late antebellum period, as Vilani
terrorists like Rachele arose from the slums of
Pretoria and Urnas to wage racially motivated violence
against their overlords.

<BR><B>Mean Tech Level(1117/1202):</B> 11.7/14.1
<BR><B>Senate Contingent:</B> 148





<h3>Lamas Subsector</h3>  Lamas has always been a remote
backwater. Facing the Vargr frontier, and having few
worlds of interest, development has always been slow.
The Civil War period saw heavy raiding by Vargr
corsairs, and the Domain of Deneb temporarily lost
control of the subsector to these forces from
1120-1126.
<P>
<B>Population (1117/1202):</B> 70.7/20.9 Billion
<BR><B>Industrial Worlds:</B> 1
<BR><B>Mean Tech Level(1117/1202):</B> 9.0/9.0
<BR><B>Senate Contingent:</B> 92




<h3>Antra Subsector</h3>  Another remote backwater subsector.
Unlike Lamas, Antra did have significant trade ties
with nearby Vargr states. But most of its prosperity
lay through the worlds of neighboring Million
Subsector, and the Civil War brought misery and
destruction.
<P>
<B>Population (1117/1202):</B> 0.5/0.3 Billion
<BR><B>Industrial Worlds:</B> None

<BR><B>Senate Contingent:</B> 41






<h3>Namidshur Subsector</h3>  The worlds of Namidshur never
attracted the same degree of interest as Vincennes or
Inar, despite its oppurtune location on the Midway
route to Vland. Unlike its neighbors, it has fewer
resources, and its location close to the vulnerable
knot of Imperial and Vargr culture worlds in trailing
Deneb discouraged development. To compensate, the
population of various worlds developed a heightened
sense of local pride and patriotism that boosted them
above the overweening pride of more developed regions.
This "cowlicked pride" (as it was called in antebellum
Deneb) was a source of much jocularity for travellers
from the Imperial Core, and went a long way in molding
prejudices held by the upper social classes regarding
the "Backward Marches."  This local pride has
diminished in the face of the Abandonment, and the
realisation that it hurt the subsector as much as
helped it. But a strong residue remains, particularly
along the border with the Frontier.
<P>
<B>Population (1117/1202):</B> 11.6/9.6 Billion
<BR><B>Industrial Worlds:</B> 1
<BR><B>Mean Tech Level:</B> 10.7/10.0
<BR><B>Senate Contingent:</B> 136





<h3>Sabine Subsector</h3>  The heart of the Midway, and
perhaps the best example of the wisdom of Norris'
reforms. Sabine was dominated economically and
politically by the feuding governments of antebellum
Magash, a situation that left that world with a very
advanced state of development, but left the rest of
Sabine a poor backwater.  While Magash was distracted
trying to contest the choice of Mora as a TL-16 world,
a significant amount of development money was
redirected to Thingen, allowing that world to boost
itself out of Magash's shadow. The growing
independence and competitiveness of Thingen and the
rest of the subsector compelled the Magashians to
unite their world in a more moderate and responsible
manner.
<P>

<BR><B>Industrial Worlds:</B> 3
<BR><B>Mean Tech Level(1117/1202):</B> 12.7/12.9
<BR><B>Senate Contingent:</B> 137





<h3>Inar Subsector</h3>  Inar suffered minor population loss as
a result of tensions on Ashasi, and due to Vargr
penetration into its coreward portion during the Civil
War.  While its industrial worlds possess a high level
of development, longstanding bickering and feuds
undermined its attractiveness to further investment
under the IDP. Only Liiri recieved aid from the
program, an event that has polarised Starn and other
advanced worlds in the Midway even further. The heart
of these feuds are generally economic and matters of
local pride, a tendency that has caused a relative
decline in the region's importance compared to the
emerging growth of other regions of the Regency.

<BR><B>Industrial Worlds:</B> 4
<BR><B>Mean Tech Level(1117/1202):</B> 12.4/12.9
<BR><B>Senate Contingent:</B> 179






<h3>Star Lane Subsector</h3>   Star Lane was, and still is, a
study in extremes. Nearly 99 percent of the population
lives on Askigaak, and the rest of the subsector is a
lightly populated backwater. This lopsidedness is the
result of a paucity of resources, and the sexiness of
the advancing Imperial frontier, that pulled money and
interest away from Star Lane. This situation was
little rectified when the Frontier Wars ended that
expansionistic push. Severe cultural differences exist
between predominantly Vilani Askigaak and the mostly
Solomani populations of outlying worlds, a trend
worsened by growing commercial contacts in the wake of
Askigaaks development under the IDP.
<P>
<B>Population (1117/1202):</B> 90.3/101 Billion
<BR><B>Industrial Worlds:</B> 1
<BR><B>Mean Tech Level(1117/1202):</B> 11.9/13.9
<BR><B>Senate Contingent:</B> 141







<h3>Vincennes Subsector</h3>  This subsector is split down the
middle between core and rim. The coreward half is
considered part of the Midway, and is dominated
economically by Vincennes; the rimward half is
Stronghold and is ruled by the economic and
demographic weight of Dekha and Ishiri. This division
shows up as a muted economic and political rivalry,
with Vincennes very uneasy about the emerging might of
"upstart" Dekha.  Massive population growth has
catapulted it into the forefront of the Regency's
development, but it has also strained services and
housing. The situation exaceberated by Vincennes'
seeming indifference to shouldering or paying for any
part of the burden.
<P>
<B>Population (1117/1202):</B> 35.5/150.5 Billion
<BR><B>Industrial Worlds:</B> 3
<BR><B>Mean Tech Level(1117/1202):</B> 14.0/12.9
<BR><B>Senate Contingent:</B> 179





<h3>Usani Subsector</h3>  Usani was thrown into near chaos by
the Collapse and Abandonment. Never a very cohesive
subsector in the first place, the populations of
entire worlds initially panicked as they were
inundated by massive waves of refugees moving into the
subsector during the 1130s. Better govermment and
military organisation, and the valorous deeds of the
"To Will One Thing" hiearchy on Deneb, eventually
improved conditions for both refugees and the locals,
reinforcing the frontier at a critical moment of the
Regency's history.  Usani still has large number of
unassimilated refugees on several of its worlds, a
distressful situation owing to chronic housing
shortages and local economic problems.

<BR><B>Mean Tech Level(1117/1202):</B> 13.0/10.0
<BR><B>Senate Contingent:</B> 11







<h3>Gulf Subsector</h3>  Gulf is slowly becoming the heart of
the Stronghold. While its worlds are still a long way
from the lofty heights of Vincennes or Mora, its
investment into industrial and educational development
has been both deep and broad, and its worlds are
advancing at a rapid pace even without the IDP.
Liberal political views and an acceptance of basic
market reforms have unshackled local businesses and
institutions, and the subsequent rise in local living
standards have stirred many neighboring subsectors
into possibly adopting its reforms.
<P>
<B>Population (1117/1202):</B> 96.5/99.0 Billion (Assuming
that Beaxon is still at 1117 levels)
<BR><B>Industrial Worlds:</B> 3
<BR><B>Mean Tech Level(1117/1202):</B> 12.3/13.7
<BR><B>Senate Contingent:</B> 113





<h3>Zeng Subsector</h3> The most heavily populated of the
Regency's subsectors, and its most fractious. Zengians
are a touchy, often factionalised lot, and a tradition
of misrule was institutionalised. This was further
exaceberated by previous Imperial meddling in local
affairs, and a deliberate indifference towards its
development affected by local and sector nobility. The
advent of the IDP and Representational Reforms
unleashed a lot of unexpiated anger and resentment
upon the old ruling elites of the region. This rage
has taken a long time to abate, and even the
subsequent rise in living standards has only lessened
the sting.
<P>
<B>Population (1117/1202):</B> 144.6/167.7 Billion
<BR><B>Industrial Worlds:</B> 4
<BR><B>Mean Tech Level(1117/1202):</B> 12.9/14.3
<BR><B>Senate Contingent:</B> 200


<h3>Kamlar Subsector</h3>  Kamlar is a buffer region with Zeng
and Usani, and its culture is reflective of that
mixing. The subsector has never been very important,
and development has only picked up in the last decade.
Mostly this is due to anticipation of the reopening of
the Regency Frontier has caused a speculative landrush
to buy up properties on worlds that would link it with
the industrial might of the Stronghold.  A line of
worlds from Pikha, through Kamlar and the Usani
frontiers, and into Namidshur and Atsah, have seen
their landprices nearly quintuple. With the recent
reopening of the Frontier, business has been
reportedly quite brisk.
<P>
<B>Population (1117/1202):</B>
<BR><B>Industrial Worlds:</B> None
<BR><B>Mean Tech Level(1117/1202):</B> 9/10
