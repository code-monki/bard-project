This is the checklist and procedures for Solo Jump IMTU, for situations when
the particulars of a jump are needed (IMO).   This is coupled with the Jump
Coefficient generation i've already posted.  Feedback is appreciated and
desired.  I'm not sure exactly on how many "anomolies" to introduce.  Seems
like the number can get pretty high (especially field variations).  Might
divide by 10 with a minimum of 1.  Any advice?  They really make it necessary
for *someone* to be watching the drive, though, even if it is an easy task to
correct.  <P>

Safe Jump:  100 diameters from nearest gravity well.

Dangerous Jump: Within 100 diameters of gravity well.

Desperate Jump: Within 10 diameters of gravity well

ex.  The navigator of the AS Ore Reaper (5/10) (who also happens to be the
Captain), rolls a basic failure when attempting to jump out at 100 diamters
from Mitchell (3034/Khulam/Diaspora) with refined fuel.  The engineer rolls
basic success.  The FJF is 10, [5*2*1] and the jump succeeds.  There will be a
maximum of 10 anamolous events in the coolant flow to the jump drive maintaing
the jump fields' integrity.

ex.  After being attacked and damaged by 3 Solee ships, the Captain orders the
RCS Kelley Victrix to jump away from Kmak at 61 diameters.  The Kelley Victrix
has taken 3H to the jump drive, which is 33.33% of its total hit capacity,
which reduces its jump factor by 3 to 1 and adding +2 Diff Mods.   Her new
jump coefficient, until repaired, is 2*3*9/5/4 = 3 =  (3/6).  The navigator
rolls an outstanding success.   The engineer rolls regular success.  The FJF
is 15 [3*10*(1/2)*1], which causes a minor jump relativity error (misjump).
If the engineer had rolled outstanding success, the result would be 8, which
be a successful jump, despite the damage to her jump drive.

3) Jump Space

*a) Engineer - Monitor coolant flow to jump drive [Easy Ship's Engineering]

Computer notification in event of anomoly.  Task is to correct coolant flow
and prevent variation in jump field.

FJF - 1 anomolies per jump

Oustanding Success: Anomoly corrected and all further anomolies prevented.
Success:  Anomoly corrected.
Failure:  Anomoly with slight variation in jump field (FJF variations)
Catastrophic Failure:  Anomoly with wild variations in jump field (FJF * D6
variations)

*b) Engineer - Monitor integrity of N-space field [Easy Ship's Engineering]

Variations affect a random ship internal location.  All variations increase
wear value on equipment in affected area by 1.

Oustanding Success:  Field integrity and coolant flow reconfigured and
optimized.  All variations corrected without effect on crew (optionally:
slight nausea to all crew in random internal location) or equipment.

Success: Field integrity reconfigured, coolant flow uncorrected.  Variation
inflicts jump sickness on all crew in affected area (slight wound to head and
chest).

Failure:  Field intregity uncorrected.  Variation inflicts severe jump
sickness on all crew in affected area (serious wound to head and chest).

Catastrophic Failure:  Field intregity variation inflicts critical jump
sickness on all crew in affected area (critical wound to head and chest).

Duration:

d6      Result
1       6 days
2-5     7 days
6       8 days

or:

126+ (2D x 6) Hours

4) Precipitation

a) Navigator -  Position exit vector  [Difficult Astrogation]

Outstanding Success- Vector positioned exactly.  No course correction required
Success- Course correction equal to 10% of current velocity required
Failure- Course correction equal to 50% of current velocity required
Catastrophic Failure- Course correction equal to 150% of current velocity

11      Uneven          1D (crew)
12      Rough           1D (hull)
13      Violent         2D (system)
14      Violent         2D (crew)
15+Violent              3D (system)

+FJF
+ 3 if warning light event
+3 Catastrophic Failure
+1 failure
-3 Outstanding success
-1 Success

Crew = number of crew affected by severe jump sickness (Serious wound to
chest)
Hull = damage to random surface location
System = damage to random internal location

Precipitation Point:
(FJF before rounding)

FJF < 1         Precipitation point is near exactly plotted position (within 3,000km)
FJF = 1         Precipitation point is in plotted hex.
FJF > 1         FJF * D6 = 30,000 km BL/BR hexes in D6 direction (clockwise from 12
o'clock) from plotted hex.

5) Post Jump

a) Navigator - Calculate location [Average Astrogation]

b) Navigator-  Conduct course correction [Easy Astrogation]
