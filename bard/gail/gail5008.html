<I>SPACE WITCH</I>, AMEILA BENSON, THE SHACKLETON SLASHER</b><BR>
reported by <A  HREF="../../credits.html#Lewis">Lewis Roberts</A><p>

Luhtalan Enforcer Command reported today that the <I>Space Witch</I>, a Luhtalan Naval vessel was lost with all hands today.  The vessel was intercepted by an unknown vessel as the <I>Space Witch</I> was preparing to jump.  The <I>Space Witch</I> sent one message saying that they were being attacked, but the message was cut off before the crew could give any clue as to the identity of their attacker or any other information.
<P>
The <I>Space Witch</I> was a <I>Stellar</I>-Class Subsidized Liner converted to military use as a transport.  It was on a mission to carry five criminally insane patients to the Crystal Springs Center on Spires.  The Center has recently shown great strides in curing the mentally ill, with a unique blend of meditation, herbal therapy and what the practitioners at the Center call mystical intervention.  They had reached an agreement with the Luhtalan government to take charge of five individuals who were considered by incurable by conventional science.
<P>
It took several hours for another vessel to get to the scene and by that time the attacker had gone.  The <I>Space Witch</I> was left a broken wreck, with severe damage to all portions of the vessel.  Evidence of brutal combat was found aboard the <I>Space Witch</I>.  Investigation shows that the bodies were attacked with both high energy weapons and hand weapons such as swords and axes.   Several bodies have been not been recovered, whether they were taken aboard the other vessel or blown out into space is unknown.
<P>
One of the missing bodies is that of Dr. Manfred Strauss, the so called the Shackleton Slasher.  A respected surgeon and philanthropist, Strauss lead a double life and was responsible for at least 23 murders in the last 15 years.  The victims were kidnapped and taken to Strauss's lair where he performed vivisections on the still living victims.  These vivisections would normally last for days.  At his trial, Strauss claimed to be looking for the secret for immortality, which he thought could be found by examining the human soul, but first he had to find the human soul.
<P>
The Luhtalan government has relayed all information to the Coalition Navy, which has dispatched a team to help with the investigating.  Ameila Benson, the junior Assemblyman from Lucifer released a statement saying, "I am deeply troubled by this incursion into Luhtalan space. The Navy must provide more assets for patrolling the worlds of the Coalition.  Large worlds such as Aubaine and Oriflamme have large fleets  to protect their citizens, but the small worlds such as Lucifer have to get by with a few converted merchant ships.  With the loss of the <I>Space Witch</I> the Luhtalan navy has been cut by a third.  Other worlds such as Phoebus or Spires are even more at risk."

<P>
Assemblyman Riki Tyler of Baldur replied, "Perhaps the idiots on Lucifer should spend some of their  money on planetary defense instead of wasting it on a celebration of the Earth Goddess or whatever nonsense they are doing this month.  I am sure the shipyards on Aubaine and Oriflamme are more than willing to sell a few top of the line SDBs to those morons."  The Luhtalan government had no reply to Tyler's comment.

reported by <A  HREF="../../credits.html#Lewis">Lewis Roberts</A><p>

A Krutyercorp spokesman announced today that Starhelm Prison had been attacked on 25/VI/1202by unknown forces.  At 12:30 standard local time, Krutyercorp Central on Kreuzung Asteroid received a radio distress call from the prison.  The prison claimed to be under attack by a unknown vessel and required urgent assistance.  Kruytercorp Central ordered the two local System Defense Boats the KS <I>Hazard</I> and the KS <I>Constant</I> to intercept and engage the intruder.  The <I>Hazard</I> was the closer of the two and was able to get to the Prison within two hours.  The crew saw a single vessel fleeing the scene.  They attempted to engage the enemy, but after a short battle the intruder managed to escape.  The <I>Hazard</I> suffered light damage, but suffered no casualties.
<p>
An investigation of the prison showed that it had taken massive damage.  All but a few central rooms had been decompressed.  Of the estimated 1200 prisoners and 100 guards, only 11 prisoners and 17 guards survived.  A preliminary examination of the debris shows that several low yield fission weapons were used against the asteroid prison, in addition to standard starship weapons.  Blast analysis shows that the bombs were placed on the asteroid's surface, or possibly inside of the asteroid.  The <I>Hazard</I>'s sensor readings show the intruder to be from 700-2000 tons, and able to accelerate at high Gs.
The survivors were unable to shed much light on the attack; they had been working on the sewage system deep in the heart of the asteroid.
<P>
 Starhelm Prison was a heavy security prison, built into a 60km diameter asteroid in the main Kruyter belt.   Kruytercorp created the prison as a for-profit enterprise in mid-1201.  Starhelm offered worlds the chance to remove dangerous convicts from their worlds and avoid the cost of building prisons.   Kruytercorp equipped the asteroid with a state of the art security system, and a defense grid to protect the asteroid from ships trying to assist in an escape.  A Kruytercorp spokesperson said that the prison was a total loss and the surviving prisoners would be returned to their home systems at the earliest moment.  She also said it has not been decided if Kruytercorp will rebuild the prison on another asteroid.  <p>

reported by <A  HREF="../../credits.html#Lewis">Lewis Roberts</A><p>

Since the RCS <I>Nightwatcher</I> docked in port yesterday, rumors have started to fly about an unspecified incident in the Wilds.  Today RCES officials at Dawn Base announced that the RCS <I>Nightwatcher</I> had discovered a raider attack on the planet Atrase/Aubaine/Old Expanses.  The <I>Nightwatcher</I> arrived several days after the attack as part of a RC diplomatic effort to improve relations with the planet.  According to eyewitnesses a large ship (probably from 500-1500 displacement tons) landed on the Zalraytown end of the island and discharged 50-100 human raiders and a dozen or so robots.  The raiding force was heavily armed with a variety of weapons, but did not seem to be a military organization. The robots were of unidentified types, but seemed to be independent entities. The raiders moved through the town attacking any resident they found. They also looted and burned many of the settlement's buildings.  The raiders continued their rampage for several days before departing. Several of the nearby farms were also attacked.  The raiders took with them a few dozen captives, and a large quantity of goods.
<P>
In their wake the most of Zalraytown was burned to the ground and many of its citizens were killed.  A number of the corpses showed evidence of torture and mutilation.  Several of the women were raped and beaten, before being killed.
Of the town's 200 known residents only 27 have been found alive. The town of Mangus has sent in several teams of aid workers to assist the survivors, most of whom are in a state of shock.
<P>
Zalraytown is a small nation on the main island of Atrase.  The central settlement is home to some light manufacturing, mostly cottage industries.  Two hundred people lived in town, while roughly another 150 lived in small farms around the town.  The farms raised crops and livestock.  The island is split between the two communities of Zalraytown and Mangus.  The two communities are semi-hostile to each other and compete for salvage from the abandoned research facility on the island. Neither side has been very receptive to Coalition overtures.  Recently the Coalition decided to send an ambassadorial party to the island to try to improve relations.  The <I>Nightwatcher</I> was dropping of this party when it found out about the attack.  The Ambassador and her staff have stayed on the island to provide assistance.  Since the attack, Mangus has made overtures to the remaining Zalraytown folk for them to come under the banner of Mangus.  Some have accepted, while others are thinking the offer over.  Both towns are very afraid of what has happened, and this incident has only increased their paranoia about outsiders.

reported by <A  HREF="../../credits.html#Lewis">Lewis Roberts</A><p>
<P>
RCES HQ at Dawn Base today released a warning to all starfaring ships.  A large Raider ship is active in Aubaine subsector.  The ship is most likely a relic Warship ranging from 500-2000 tons in displacement.  It is either a Vampire ship or has Virus infected robots aboard.  It recently attacked the island nation of Zalraytown on Atrase/Aubaine/Old Expanses and inflicted several hundred casualties.  It is most likely the same ship which attacked Starhelm Prison in the Kruyter system and damaged the KS <I>Hazard</I> System Defense Boat.  Intelligence indicates that it has at least 100 armed individuals aboard, though they seem to lack military training.  They should be considered to be extremely dangerous.
<P>
Civilians who encounter this vessel are urged to flee and to report any sightings to the nearest Coalition port. Coalition Naval vessels are being put on alert and several patrols are being sent out to find this ship.

reported by <A  HREF="../../credits.html#Lewis">Lewis Roberts</A><p>

Today the Free Trader <I>Sheila's Nestegg</I> handed over a proclamation to RCES HQ from Britton McCarthy, the leader of the Black Tigers. The proclamation stated:
<ul>
"On 2/12/1201 the Black Tigers seized control of the planet Bikar in Khulam subsector of Diaspora.  We have renamed the planet Freeport, and will operate the planet as just that.  It will be open to all persons who come in search of starport free from the burdensome interference of government. Military vessels from planetary governments are unwelcome at this time.  Any attempt against the government of Freeport, or its guests, will be met with hostility and the citizens of Freeport have sworn to defend their planet with the last drop of blood.
<P>
We have upgraded the planetary starport by adding a powerful radar and navigation system, there are now four navigation beacons in orbit around the planet, A squad of highly trained mechanics stands ready to repair your starship.  Fuel is provided at only 10Cr a ton.   A variety of entertainment facilities have been setup for your pleasure and more are in the works.
<P>
Freeport has an open emigration policy and no visas are required for entry or exit.  Freeport has an open market, where any and all goods are for sale.  While some governments charge 50%-80% tax on goods put up for auction, Freeport charges a mere 5% of the sale price, the proceeds from this fee go to upkeep the starport."
<P>
Signed President Britton McCarthy
</UL>
CIN has learned that the Black Tigers were a small Free Lancer group operating out of Lancer.  They had been around since 1198 and were moderately successful.  They had made several forays into Diaspora sector.  Sources describe them as, "...competent, but ethically challenged."
<P>
RCES officials had no comment, until the full facts can be uncovered.  Off the record, one senior RCES officer said, "We have enough TEDs out there, we don't need to start exporting them.  I hope we send the Marines in to kick these ****er's teeth down their throat."

Keipes (0132 B677884-6) declares the fourth Empire after the sudden
death of Tekim Hsun, Grand Master of the Order of Revealed Knowledge.
<P>    The Grand Master and 31 members of the Order were killed by an
accident while demonstrating a relict TL13 grav tank.  We have
information about excavations at the destroyed Imperial navy base.
Whether the tank is really a relic or an outworld import is not know
yet.  It appears that the "accident" was a carefully planed murder
attempt.  Elite troops of Grand Duke Eledo of Balawak blocked the
whole region.<P>
    On the next day, Kim Eoi was declared as new Grand Master.  She's
known as a progressive force in the Order of Revealed Knowledge.  A
wave of arrests were noticed by our agents in Peidoan, capital of
Keipes, and in other cities.  Duke Eledo declares martial law for the
next two months.<P>
    The days later, Grand Master Kim Eoi declares the Moot will be
reestablished with all Nobility (we know about 22) of Keipes having a
vote and the Order having veto right. The Moot should elect a new
regent within two weeks. Duke Eledo declares this day as an holy day.
<P>
    The local news system announces the beginning of a new era. The
Order of Revealed Knowledge has done a good job, preserving know
needed wisdom and developing "methods" to banish the all destroying
virus. But know, each citizen has the duty to help the reestablishing
the new and better empire.<P>
    Our agents had found indications of offworlder activities.  One
picture shows three human-looking persons wearing the old imperial
combat armors.  A detailed plan exists to restructure the Keipes
economy and to raise the TL within one year.
