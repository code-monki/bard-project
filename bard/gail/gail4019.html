<P>

I did these about a year ago, and I put some notations I must have believed
I could translate later. Here is how the system works to the best of my
memory. These were meant as special talents, but I gave most of them a
relation to existing talents. A player who received the Arcana talent could
pick one, then role 1D10. If they rolled above the number they could take
that talent, if their psi score was at least the number listed. If they had
the related talent(s) (labeled "p" for primary relation, or "s" for
secondary relation, a more distantly related talent)they could take the
talent if their psi score was high enough, without needing to roll. If they
had both the primary and secondary (which always needs a higher psi score to
be chosen then a primary relation) they only needed a psi score high enough
to take it as a primary relation.
<P>
Some talents have a psi listing above 10,
meaning that that talent could only be taken if they had a related talent. A
few have the "a" notation, which means that it is an alternative form of an
existing talent and can not be taken if the character has the talent. The
"c" notation means a talent is complementary to an existing talent, and can
only be taken if the character has that talent. Being that Arcana is a
rather rare talent I didn't refine any of the talents much, so I don't have
any data on costs to use or range costs.
Anyway, here's that list:
<P>
All page numbers refer to the main TNE rulebook.<P>
<b> Lure</b> (p. telepath 6) a psi call to someone or some group, which causes them
to come to you
<P>
<b> Force</b> (p. telepath 11) cause someone to do something to do what you ask.
Difficulty is based on how the subject feels about the action.
<P>
<b> Increase other's str</b> (p. awareness 6) as increase str, but on other people
<P>
<b> Increase other's con</b> (p. awareness 7) as increase con, but on other people.
On a simple test against psi (ave) can be taken in addition to increase
other's str.
<P>
<b> Heal others</b> (p. awareness 10) as heal self. On a simple test against psi
(diff) can be taken in addition to increase other's str and increase other's
con.
<P>
<b> Projective sleep</b> (p. awareness or telepath 2) as the awareness talent
sleep. Subject must be willing. On a simple test against psi (ave if
character has one primary talent, easy if they have both), can be taken in
addition to increase other's str.
<P>
<b> Teleport object</b> (p. teleportation 5) move inanimate object using the
teleportation rules.
<P>
<b> Teleport others</b> (p. teleportation 7) as teleport self, only with other
living objects.
<P>
<b> Jumping</b> (p. telephysics 8, s. awareness 9) ability to make long/high leaps
and land safely.
<P>
<b> Flying</b> (p. telephysics 10, s. awareness 11) allows character to fly for a
short time (several minutes, depending on level of success). On a simple
test of psi (dif), may be taken in addition to jump.
<P>
<b> Enhance speed</b> (p. awareness 7) adds +1 to in. for every level of success
for the purpose of determoning action order only. If it pushes in. above 6
the character can take extra actions, as in the normal rules.
<P>
<b> Decrease range</b> (p. awareness 4) this talent is automatic. all range costs
decrease by 1 level.
<P>
<b> Sense heat</b> (p. clairvoyance 6) sense heat sources. Works similar to IR
goggles.
<P>
<b> Farsense</b> (p. clairvoyance 11) clairvoyance of all senses.
<P>
<b> Advanced telekinisis</b> (a. telephysics 1) a longer term version of
telekinisis, allowing the psion to hold an object suspended for several
minutes. Can not lift as much as regular telekinisis.
<P>
<b> Paralyze</b> (p. telepath 8) Hold a person still for turns equal to level of
success.
<P>
<b> Attract attention</b> (p. telepath 3) cause 1D6 people per level of success to
look at psion. On a simple test against psi (easy), can be taken in addition
to lure or force.
<P>
<b> Join</b> (c. teleportation 5) teleport to close range of a well known person,
even if their location is unknown.
<P>
<b> Project image</b> (p. arcana 10) project a 2 or 3D image, clarity dependent on
success and distence.
<P>
<b> Open lock</b> (p. telephysics 4/8) unlock a simple mechanical/ complex
mechanical lock.
<P>
<b> Generate charge</b> (p. telephysics 2) generate a few volts of electrical
charge for several minutes. The charge is not enough to injure someone, but
can run electrical devices.
<P>
<b> Generate lightning</b> (p. telephysics 9) generate a large electrical charge
for less then a second, enough to stun someone for rounds equal to the level
of success. Can be taken with generate charge on a simple roll against psi
(ave).
<P>
<b> Luminecence</b> (p. telephysics 4) soft to intense illumination, brightness
dependent on success.
<P>
<b> Learn language</b> (p. telepath 8) requires contact with an individual or group
speaking the language. Effects last 1D6 hours after contact is broken, after
which the knowledge quickly fades.
<P>
<b> Dampen sound</b> (p. arcana 6) aside from whatever fun uses players can dream
up to spoil the ref's plans, adds to stealth, but can not substitute for it
(unskilled penelties still apply)
<P>
<b> Sense psion</b> (p. telepath 5) find a person trained in psionics, or sense a
psionic event in progress.
<P>
<b> Regulate body heat</b> (p. awareness 3, a. telephysics) negate limited effects
of hot or cold climates.
<P>
<b> Enhance senses</b> (p. awareness 7) gives character bonuses to perception
rolls.
<P>
<b> Susperience</b> (p. telepath 5) psion can enter other people's dreams while
asleep. Very difficult to control, but in the game I'm currently running it
allows that character to comunicate with people sectors away from her
(although she doesn't know it yet).
<P>
Keep in mind that most of these have never been tested, so I don't know how
well they will play.
