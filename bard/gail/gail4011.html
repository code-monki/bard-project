When your players return from a dicey mission in the Wilds with a huge
lucrative cargo of relics do they get ignored or are they interviewed by the
Coalition networks.  IMTU I use Fame as a die roll to be recognized, the
roll is modified by the PC's and the NPC's career etc as below.  However if
the players have recently returned from a major mission they are often
greeted by Trid crews and their pictures may very soon be spread all across
the planet.<P>

Some RCES and Marine personnel are household names already and although
press intrusion is uncommon they are easily recognized on most worlds, the
same goes for the players.  This can have positive and negative benefits.
<P>

<h3>Rules</h3> 

5 Categories affect the fame of a PC or NPC.  Social Standing, Ethics,
Success, Media and Politics. Other than Social Standing all scores may be
negative<P>

<B>Social Standing:</B> Divide the SOC level of the character by 2.

Conduct : Award a rating based on their known conduct.  A negative rating
reflects behaviour such as unnecessary violence, killing prisoners etc.  A
positive rating suggests they follow Coalition codes of conduct. Drops by 1
point per month to a minimum of half the maximum total or 10 whichever is
lower.
<P>
<B>Success</B> How successful the group has been, both in terms of mission
objectives and how they have dealt with unforeseen problems. Drops by 1
point per week to a minimum of half total or 10 whichever is lower.
Media : How much media attention they have got and in what light they have
been portrayed.  Drops by 1 point per week not appearing in the media, never
drops below half its maximum score or 10 whichever is lower. (This can
include publishing books etc. A bestseller would raise media by 10-15 pts
and the score would not decrease until the book dropped out of the top 10
books list.)<P>

<B>Politics:</B> What are the view of the person on the Federalist/Centrist
politics, score positive for Federalist and negative for Centrist. People
from Centrist planets automatically have a base score of -2, conversely
persons from a federalist planet start from a base of +2.  For people from
the Wilds make a judgement based on their government.
<P>
Total the magnitude of all these scores  (i.e... ignore the positive or
negative sign) This is the Renown score, divide this by 10 (round up) for
their Fame Rating.
<P>
The following table gives the base difficulty for people to recognise the
name on am outstanding success they are recognised on sight.
<P>
<table border=0>
<TR><Th>Fame Score  <th>      Difficulty (base asset is 5)</tr>
<TR><TD>1-2      <TD>                  Impossible</tr>
<TR><TD>3-4      <TD>                  Formidable</tr>
<TR><TD>5-6      <TD>                  Difficult</tr>
<TR><TD>7-8      <TD>                  Average</tr>
<TR><TD>9-10     <TD>                 Routine</tr>
<TR><TD>11+ <TD>                     Easy</tr>
</table>
<P>
<B>Modifiers to Difficulty</B><BR>
<B>Location:</B> Homeworld -1,    Coalition World 0    Allied World +1    Wilds +3
Enemy World (non Wilds) +2<P>

<B>Occupation:</B> Same Occupation/Service -2,    Similar Occupation/Service -1,
Completely unrelated Occupation +1,    Area of interest/Hobby -1<P>

Other Modifiers as decided by the GM<P>

I don't use these rules every time the PC's walk down the street, but they
can be useful.  The PC/NPC is likely to be known for whichever area his fame
is greatest.<P>

<h3>Examples</H3>

<a href="../dani/dani0923.html"><B>David <I>Anvil</I> Brannon</B></A><P>

<B>SOC:</B>  +5 (Half Social Standing of A)<P>
<B>Conduct:</B> +4 (Mostly follows Coalition Rules of Engagement)<P>
<B>Success:</B> +24<BR>
    (An outstanding engineer (+2) before Baldur was recontacted, Anvil was
one of the first graduates of the Hiver Tech Academy (+2), and shipped as
Chief Engineer on the Aube (+2).  After his rescue he has served with the
RCES on 4 missions, the first trip to Suudo was unsuccessful (-4) primarily
due to faulty intelligence. He survived a disastrous misjump and
successfully managed to travel back to Coalition Space with Jump-4
blueprints and some anagethics (+5).  However his presence on the next
mission, where the surviving members of the Original Twelve (Presumed
Destroyed) were rescued raised his reputation tremendously (+15).  A mostly
quiet mission supplying rebels on Suudo was next and carried out most
competently (+2).<P>

<B>Media:</B>  +38<BR>
    Despite hating the limelight and preferring his own company Anvil is one
of the best known faces in the Coalition.  As one of the few surviving
crewman from the Aube (+10) and a minor character in Gabrella's articles on
the rescue (+2) his name is known to many people.  However his presence on
the mission Presumed Destroyed has meant that his face was been shown on
every News programme for a week (+20).
<P>
<B>Politics:</B> -2<BR>
    His politics are unknown and beyond being a Balduri he has never
commented on politics in his life.
<P>
<B>Renown Total:</B> 73<p>
<B>Fame Score:</B> 8 (Average Difficulty)<BR>
    The man on the street will recognise Anvil (either by sight or by name)
approximately half the time, he is one of the more famous people in the
Coalition. On his homeworld (-1 Diff) his is a household name and he has a
following amongst the general population.<P>
All RCES Starship crew (-2 Diff) know of him.
All in all a very famous man, and this can make it hard on him as he is a
private man tormented by the memories of his suffering on Nicosia. He may
also suffer from professional jealousy and the fact that any mistake could
be blown out of all proportion due to his high media profile.<P>

<B>Josiah <I>Hodges</I> Grainger</B><P>

<B>SOC:</B> 4    (Half SOC of 8)<P>
<B>Conduct:</B> +2 (Unremarkable, but correct)<P>
<B>Success:</B> +4<BR>
    Involved in first contact with the Hivers and Ithklur on Baldur (+2 was
higher several years ago), successful member of crew during completion of
resupply of guerrillas on Suudo.<P>
<B>Media:</B> +2   <BR>
A known team member of Anvil's with no bad press)<P>
<B>Politics:</B> -2 <BR>
His politics are unknown and beyond being a Balduri he has never
commented on politics in his life.<P>

<B>Renown Total:</B>14<P>

<B>Fame Score:</B> 2 (Base impossible task)
A virtual unknown, he may be recognised occasionally, but unless by someone
in the RCES or from Baldur it will be along the lines of, that face looks
familiar.
