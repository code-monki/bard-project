<H3>CNERs </h3>
(Nonmilitary) CNERS is the nickname for
Confederation of Nightrim Exploration and Reconnaissance Service.
	With the passing of the Exploration Bill less than a two years ago and
the evaluation of a number of early exploration missions, it became
apparent that special training would be necessary if these missions were
to yield any positive results.  With their training modeled after that
of the Old Imperial Scout Service the CNERS would have to be everything
the Scouts were and more.  This is an intensive one year full time
academy program.<P>
	Explorers, soldiers and emissaries.  There is no one word which can
completely describe a CNERS life.  To the Ayanshi they are the
Ovaytahalz the bringers of light.<p>

<H3>Marine Force Recon </h3>
(Military) 
 A specialized branch of the Stonehaven Marine Corps. 
 Marine Force
Recon troopers are trained in the skills of infiltration, demolition and
assassination.  Their task, quite simply, is to disrupt hostile
planetary governments command, communications and support structures
prior to a full scale invasion.  To accomplish this most Force Recon
units are orbitally deployed, provided with a minimum of support and
expected to accomplish the impossible.  Force Recon units often operate
independently for long periods, living off the land and providing
tactical support to local resistance units.  Needless to say Force Recon
troopers are among the Confederation's most respected.

<H3>Survivor</h3>
(Nonilitary)  The term Survivor does little to tell of the hardships these people
endured as a result of the collapse.  In the Confederation of Nightrim
only characters generated on the world of Mull are eligible to become
survivors.<p>
	Survivors were the people who went beyond the sealed domes looking for
replacement parts, they were the people who crawled through miles of
ventilation ducts to find that one precious part.  When everything else
came apart these were the people who kept fighting to live, they never
gave up hope and they never lost the will to survive.  To them the
options were simple, life or death, and death simply  wasn't an option.
