<P>
<B>Askigaak Corridor:</B> J-1 route connecting 14 worlds in
Star Lane, Vincennes and even Gulf Subsectors (Qevar).
The Corridor is entirely dominated by the huge
demographic weight of Askigaak, to the point that
neighboring worlds refer to themselves as either its
"suburbs" or the "countryside."
<P>
<B>Atsah Subsector:</B> Region of Trailing Deneb contained
within the Wilds. Formerly settled and controlled by
the Third Imperium. Like its neighbor Million
Subsector, Atsah was underdeveloped, as most of its
economy supported the Midway trade routes moving out
of Corridor to the far corners of the Domain of Deneb.
Economically the subsector was dominated by the high
population world of Atadl (Deneb 3015), but the
majority of its worlds were lightly populated worlds
hosting a mixture of agricultural and trade related
industries.
<P>
The subsector was severely damaged by the attacks of
the Dzaargh Federate, which captured several worlds in
1116, and which helped to severe the Domain of Deneb's
ties to the rest of the Third Imperium. Several worlds
were granted independence by the DoD in an effort to
create a buffer region with the Vargr states of
Corridor. The Abandonment depleted the subsector
during the Collapse, and few of its worlds are that
heavily populated. While many systems have fallen
under primitive strongman dominated feudal states,
sporadic contact with the Regency military and RQS has
kept cultural ties strong, and planners expect little
resistance in the subsector to resurgent repopulation.
<P>
<B>Backwash:</B> The cluster of economic and cultural
activity, existent within an adjacent developed
region, that coincides with expansion into any
frontier or backwater.  Nine-tenths of all
colonisation is a cavalcade of merchants, transit
workers, bureuacrats and hangers-on, that subsist upon
the trade generated by a region undergoing colonial
development. Because of the dangers and economic
expense of colonisation, most people directly involved
will not risk the dangers or hardship, preferring to
stay based within a safe previously developed region,
and wait for the pioneers to tame the colony worlds
for their safe eventual settlement.  Regency
policymakers and demographic planners are already
predicting a similar cycle in trailing portions of
Deneb, and some signs are already extant in Usani.
<P>
<B>Bon Voyage:</B> Percieved trade and shipping route
comprising several worlds running up the Regency
Frontier from Pikha/Zeng, past Deneb/Usani, and into
Atsah Subsector. The choice of this route is based
upon the enormous economic output of the Stronghold,
and the simple linear path that goods to and from this
region to the expanding Frontier. Most notable in
these calculations have the worlds of Gampin/Atsah
(Deneb 2820) and Khishuda/Atsah (Deneb 2918)
<P>
<B>Bon Voyage Boom:</B> Outrageous increase in land prices on
worlds in the Bon Voyage region.  Many habitable
worlds with small populations have been deluged by
land speculators since the announcement of the
Frontiers' opening. Most notable of these are
Avernus/Usani (Deneb 2027) and Azed Bek/Usani (Deneb
2323).
<P>
<B>Borderline:</B> J-1 route connecting 14 worlds in Pretoria
Subsector, running from Marz (Deneb 0201) through the
Regency Safe, then the Frontier, and finally
terminating at the Wilds world of Taa (Deneb 0701).
This region has always been lightly developed, and the
Collapse did not help economies shattered by the Civil
War and Vargr raiding. Because of its overlap into
both the Wilds and the Safe, military presence is very
pronounced and welcomed. In many cases the military
and supporting the Quarantine has become the main
source of income for these worlds, and local political
groups have been vehemently opposed to opening up the
Regency Frontier in the past, for fear of losing this
income.
<P>
<B>Deneb Cluster:</B> J-1 cluster of 24 worlds in Usani and
Vincennes Subsector. Physically and economically
dominated by the demographic bulk of Deneb itself, few
of its worlds are well developed. The Abandonment
caused significant population migration to many
smaller habitable worlds in the cluster, most notably
Amshal (Deneb 1926). It is anticpated that the
reopening of the Regency Frontier will cause a new
demographic shock in the form of so called backwash
settlement, on several worlds. Demographers are
predicting a population boom of twenty billion people
in Usani alone.  The trailing "arm" of the cluster is
part of the romantically named Bon Voyage.
<P>
<B>Denebian Rampart:</B> Romantic name given to the Regency
Frontier, or adjacent regions of the safe, in
Pretoria, Lamas, Antra and Namidshur Subsector. In
these regions normal economic activity has all but
ceased due to the overriding threat of Virus, and the
looming dominance of the military and quarantine
forces.
<P>
<B>Gauntlet:</B> Codename for those systems in the Wilds
within 4 parsecs of the Regency Frontier.  The
Gauntlet is not intended to act as a primary defense
line, but as an additional barrier to detect and slow
incoming threats.  All of these systems contain
forward emplaced listening posts and surveillance
ships, with fast long range scouts located at the 100
diameter line for early warning of the Frontier should
a Vampire Fleet move into the region.  Those worlds
with a short supply of refueling points, like one or
two gas giants, often have battle rider squadrons
hidden in ambush points for weeks at a time. All
Regency Naval and Quarantine vessels operating in the
region serve under relaxed rules of engagement.  Since
the Frontier's opening, the Regency Frontier Fleets
have posted additional forces and patrols in the area.
Some temporary facilities have been replaced with
permanent base structures, hinting at a possible move
of naval units.
<P>
<B>Million Subsector:</B> Region of Trailing Deneb contained
within the Wilds. Formerly settled and controlled by
the Third Imperium.  Million's tenous position on the
border with the Vargr and mediocre resource base did
little to attract trade during the Antebellum period,
and most of its worlds were entrepots of trade and
intrigue between Imperial culture humans and insurgent
Vargr traders and travellers. The news of Strephons'
assassination caused two Vargr powers, the United
Followers of Augurgh and the Dzaargh Federate, to
invade the trailing and coreward portions of the
subsector. Unlike Atsah, Millions was retained by the
DoD during the entire Civil War period, only to
Abandon it in the face of Virus and the Collapse.
Today Million is a crazy-quilt of human survivors and
Vargr refugees; Regency planners anticipate some
problems with assimilating the region because of its
fractious and scattered political factions.
<P>
<B>Pioneers:</B> First wave colonists. Professional and
semi-professional workers skilled in taming,
developing and building up a previously unclaimed
world for further development by later colonial waves.
In antebellum times Pioneer corporations and
collectives worked under contract for the Imperial
Ministry of Colonisation.
<P>
The Regency has fewer such personnel, and mostly
within far spinward portions of Spinward Hinters.  As
such the resettlement of Corridor Sector and Trailing
Deneb will probably resemble the colonisation of North
America and Australia:</B> waves of transient colonists
will open up worlds through military action, tame it
enough that Backwash settlers are compelled to
immigrate, and then the transients will move to
another unclaimed region and start the process all
over again.
<P>
<B>Plant "N#":</B>  Regency military or government owned
munition, manufacturing or shipyard facilities.  All
of these plants are exclusively intended for forces
enlisted against Virus, or enforcing the Quarantine.
Most of these facilities are capable of TL-15
manufacture, and a growing number are TL-16. Nearly
all of these plants are located in systems of TL-14 to
16 capability, though a few are found just about
everywhere.  Most of the plants are operated, under
contract, by various planetary and private corporate
entities according to Regency standards and policies.
In many cases scientific and technical personnel come
into contact with cutting edge research and
development, and most plants "parole" outdated or
unnecessary equipment and materials to nearby worlds;
this has aided significantly the Regency's efforts at
technological dispersal and development.
<P>
<B>Sabinar Main:</B> J-1 main connecting 42 worlds in Sabine
and Inar Subsectors. Sabinar was the main conduit of
the great Midway trade coming down through Deneb to
spinward portions of the Spinward Marches.
Consequently several of its high population worlds are
rather well developed, including Magash and Starn.
Many were and still are the lights of the sector's
economy, even if they still bicker and compete
vociferously against each other.
<P>
<B>Spinward Main:</B> The great J-1 main that connects most
of the Spinward Marches. The Main actually starts in
Star Lane/Deneb at Mater Nova (Deneb 0221) and Adapam
(Deneb 0224). Those worlds of spinward Star Lane
contained in the Main are considered to be culturally
part of the Marches rather than Deneb.
<P>
<B>Zeng Connector:</B> J-1 cluster connecting 21 worlds in
Zeng/Deneb and Macon/Reft. Because of previous
economic underdevelopment, most worlds have
independent economies that permit them to contain the
economic and political struggles of Lilad (Deneb 1135)
and Fessenden (Deneb 1440). Several water worlds,
notably Third Mu (Deneb 1137), Ushashin (Deneb 1138)
and Dawn (Deneb 1336) have recently come under
scrutiny by dissident groups on Lilad, as possible
worlds of settlement or refuge, in anticipation of
intensified fighting on their homeworld.
