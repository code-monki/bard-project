<FONT SIZE=6>Non-Ablative Damage System</FONT><P>

This is an attempt to fix something that has bothered many people
(including me, from time to time) about TNE's combat system, namely
that it's too hard to injure PCs without using ridiculously powerful
weapons.<P>

The system works as follows:
<P>
<B>1)</B>      Use D10s for damage
<P>

<B>2)</B>       All PC hit points are halved, except for the head. All NPCs have
hit points equal to double their base stats (12 for Novice and
Experienced NPCs, 14 for Veterans and 16 for Elites).
<P>

<B>3)</B>     The severity of a wound is determined by comparing the rolled
damage to the damaged locations hit points, as normal. However damage
is not cumulative - each wound stands on its own. The procedure for
NPCs is the same, and damage to the head is not doubled.
<P>

<B>4)</B>      Wound states are somewhat cumulative.
        A second slight wound results in -2 initiative, three slight wounds
equal one serious wound, but do not disable any part of the body,
unless they're all on the same place. Slight wounds do have extra
effect beyond the third one, and do not have any extra effect if the
character is already seriously or critically wounded.
        A second serious wound results in a -4 to initiative, and a third
one results in the equivalent to a critical wound (the character is
unconscious and will die in 10 minutes, etc). Extra serious wounds
beyond this have no extra effect.
<P>

<B>5)</B>      Note the "no extra effect" in 4 above does not mean that no knock-
down, panic, etc is caused, just that the character's overall wound
severity does not get any worse.
That's about it. All normal consequences of wounds still apply (knock-
down, stun, etc). The big thing is that body locations aren't ablative,
and that there is some consequence to having lots of light wounds
scattered over one's body. NPC's wounds are now assessed the same way
as PCs, too. This should balance things up somewhat.
