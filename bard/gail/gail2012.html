<B>Arkidgi:</B> The dreaded "Thunder Gods" of Vilani myth.
These are largely thought to have been inspired by
Ancient juggernauts and automated fortresses that
survived the Final War. At any rate they are terrible
firebreathing and earthshaking giants, oblivious to
the destruction they inflict upon normal people.
Because of their indestructible nature, Vilani
cultures tend to lack the heroic myths of overcoming a
monster or demon that flourish in traditional Solomani
legends. In many ways the Arkidgi benefited the
Vilani, as it caused early communities to focus upon
nature in less superstitious and adversarial ways,
helping to ease their transition from gilded captivity
under the Ancients to the difficult yet hospitable
countryside. Nowadays the term "Arkidgi" has a pair of
meanings: usually it means a blind, blundering idiot;
but more rarely it refers to a person who moves
ponderously but with great patience and thoroughness,
so that resistance is slowly worn down through
attrition rather than messy confrontation. Generally
the emperors of the old Ziru Sirka were titled
Arkidgi.
<P>
<B>Muriisdi:</B> Helpful angelic beings of Vilani myth. Often
they are confused with angelic or 'Elohim' of Terran
Middle Eastern origin, but in reality they are more
down to earth than those. Where the former are
supernatural beings of oftentimes terrible divine
power, the Muriisdi are more like supernatural good
citizens. They are more similiar to the Solomani
Japanese 'Tenshi', beings who interact directly with
human communities and intervene daily through
propitious fortune.  Because of the horrible
depredations inflicted by the Arkidgi, Vilani
religious and folk tradition tend to emphasize
communal deeds rather than supernatural powers.
Muriisdi are usually depicted as thin whispery spirits
with soulful eyes, elfin ears and beak like noses.
They lack mouths as they feed vicariously off of their
good deeds. They have long bony hands and misshapen
feet, though in reality they are usually depicted with
no locomotive features at all, and appear rooted to a
shadow or dark corner.  While ancient folk beliefs
tend to embarrass Vilani elders, Muriisdi stories are
a common rite of passage for their children, and
artworks and prayers commemorating their good deeds
are commonly found in traditional Vilani households.
<P>
<B>Operation Skybolt:</B> The Regency pacification and
annexation of the Islands Subsectors in 1140. After
the decision to secure the Islands was reached,
elements of the 19th, 74th and 128th Fleets moved to
forward bases like Tonnurad, and assembled into two
main battle groups: Task Forces Oliphant and
Crocodile. The combined forces jumped off from
Zuflucht (Reft 0921) and quickly overawed the
decimated inhabitants of Serendip Belt (Reft 1323)
into surrendering without a fight. The two groups
stopped to wait for their supply trains; resupplied
they moved into the bloodiest fight of the entire
campaign: the pacification of New Colchis (Reft 1327).
<P>

After a brutal six week battle, the two task forces
parted, with Oliphant moving to take Joyeuse (Reft
1628), New Home (Reft 1925, in what was another short
but brutal fight), Colchis (2026) and Amondiage
(2325). Crocodile overran the cluster of worlds
adjacent to New Colchis, moved to take Topas (1522),
Neubayern (1822), Sansterre (2322) and rejoined
Oliphant to capture Amondiage. Skybolt continued for
another six months total, as Neubayernian and New
Colchisian soldiers on Elysee (1525) temporarily set
aside their differences and attacked the small Regency
Army and Marine Garrison assigned to patrol the world,
and these forces broke up into guerilla units after
being repulsed by Regency Marine reinforcements.
<P>
<B>Rainbow Vale:</B> Center of Magash/Sabine's (Deneb 0316)
powerful biotech industry. Originally the Vale was a
deep excavation and drilling site for research into
the mysterious life that exists far beneath the
surface in the Sunless Sea. Thousands of bore holes
were drilled by various technologies in a vain attempt
to tap the Deep Sea layers.
<P>
Because of its remote location and the outrageous
science that this work seemed to encourage, the Vale
is rather out of place for a world still dominated by
staid Vilani politics. It was also independent of the
vicious inter-city politics that turned the world into
a seething powderkeg for most of the antebellum
period. In many ways the local political elites simply
left the eccentric scientists alone, allowing them to
build some very non-Vilani expertise in advanced
biotechnology. Today the Vale is a semi-autonomous
research and development enclave of about two million
people. It has an advanced research university, its
own police and militia, and a strong sense of disdain
for politics of any kind. The local elite are
practically of celebrity status on Magash, and many
senior executives are List A political figures in
their own right, and hold most of the real power in
Magash's convoluted government. Their steady
accumulation of wealth allowed Magash to bankroll its
unification after the Collapse, and helped modernise
its industry to keep pace despite the TL-15 cap.
<P>
The Vale takes its name from the kaleidoscopic mineral
assemblages that were unearthed by past drilling
operations. The community is actually built into the
sides of a large crater complex, with the crater
floors left open for the shipyards and starport.
<P>
<B>Red Pelts:</B>  Pirate group of Suedzuk Vargr that
blundered their way through Corridor Sector and into
Millions Subsector (Deneb D) in the mid-1140s. As
remarkable as their survival against the great odds of
the Wilds was, they proceeded to harry isolated Wilds
worlds along the Regency Frontier from several bases
in Millions, in spite of active opposition from the
RQS and several Pack groups. Making common cause with
the insane "King Tut" of Rroerruerz (Deneb 2001),
their raids reached a fever pitch in 1144-45, with
several bloody incursions into Antra and Namidshur.
<P>
Their preferred tactics were brutal to the point of
massacre. Unlike most pirates, however, they seemed to
work mainly as mercenary for warlords and TEDs
scattered throughout the Wilds. They operated under a
strange honor code that forbade looting and pillage,
but at the same time those restrictions freed them
from treating captives or civilians with any kind of
mercy, and the slow summary executions they preferred
made them the bane of Hell's Hairpin during their
short reign of terror. An alliance of Pack assassins
and RQS covert personnel finally tracked them down to
their lair, and they were wiped out to the last dog.
<P>
<B>Sidhe:</B> Pronounced "Seeth". Ancient Solomani Irish word
for fairies or fey creatures, in this case those
supernatural entities that ranked below the "tuatha de
danaan", the gods and masters of the Irish Isles.
Though largely an obscure term nowadays, certain
psionic subcultures use the word in reference to wild
or renegade psions who violate their licenses and
commit illegal acts with their abilities. The current
context of the term seems to stem from a famous
Solomani science fiction movie trilogy that involves
psionic characters motivated by dark supernatural
power.<P>

<B>Spinward Defense Complex:</B> Multiworld Regency defense
installation found in Gulf Subsector (Deneb M) and
comprises the worlds of Inkekush (Deneb 0233),
Saguenay (0235), Maricutin (0534) and Preslin (0633).
The SDC dates back to the Third Frontier War,
following the poor performance of Imperial forces
against well motivated and led Outworld Coalition
forces.<P>

The poor quality of training and logistics, and
regressed state of military arsenals BTC led to the
creation of several military ranges on the worlds
listed above in the 1010s. These ranged from automated
factories, advanced technical and gunnery training
facilites, and test ranges for proving a variety of
new technologies. The 2nd Experimental Fleet (Gizmos
and Black Smoke) is assigned specifically to the SDC,
testing new ships that issue forth from the yards on
the two Deneb Depots. The 303rd Fleet (The Valkyries)
also uses the SDC, but for different reasons: it
constantly works against an aggressor training force
that teaches Regency naval personnel in foreign
tactics and equipment. Proficiency gained against
simulated vampire fleets is spread throughout the rest
of the Regency by Valkyrie exchange crews. Unlike most
training units, which are often overworked and
resented by rank and file personnel, the Valkyries
numbers allow for better disemination of new
techniques and tactics.
<P>
In antebellum times the Spinward Branch of Naval
Intelligence maintained their main instruction and
training academy on Preslin; one of their most famous
graduates being the future First Regent, who credited
his successful prosecution of the Fifth Frontier War
in large part to the intensive and demanding training
he received there.<P>

<B>Sunless Sea:</B> The series of deep subterranean seas that
lie under Magash/Sabine (Deneb 0316). Magash is a
rocky cored world that formed with an enormous amount
of water in its crust and mantle. Over time this water
pooled and collected due to tidal attraction and
tectonic flexing into massive water bodies that
contain more aggregate liquid than most water worlds.
The sea actually consists of several layers at various
depths: a layer of hydrated minerals and saturated
dirt and rock at a depth of four to seven hundred
kilometers beneath the surface; An Artesian zone of
deep vertical water tables trapped by impermeable rock
or within natural faultlines between nine hundred and
fifteen hundred kilometers; and the Deep Sea itself
which surrounds the core, creating a four hundred
kilometer blanket of high pressure water.
<P>
Biological samples taken from the upper zones indicate
that the Deep Sea is rich in life. But technical
limitations prevent direct research and observation of
these lifeforms, and hundreds of years after their
discovery basic questions about this ecosystem are
still largely unanswered. The Deep Sea is much hotter
than normal oceans due to residual heat from the core,
too hot to normally support the creation of proteins
for life to propagate. Also high pressures exists at
levels thousands of times greater than normally
encountered by terrestrial life. Research into these
lifeforms is controversial, as the limited information
tends to cause local scientists to bend the rules of
acceptable theory with bizarre experiments and
hypotheses. In spite or perhaps because of this
freewheeling "gunslinger" science, Magash has
accumulated a significant biotech industry that is one
of the largest in the Spinward Extents.
<P>
<B>"Tutankhamen":</B> Insane TED who briefly controlled
Rroerruerz (Deneb 2001) in the aftermath of the
Abandonment. Rroerruerz, formerly known as Filanger,
had been the site of several resorts and estates that
were frequently patronised by both Imperial and Vargr
elite and wealthy before the Imperial Civil War. Most
of these facilities were heavily automated, with robot
and computer populations in the tens of thousands.
Most of these robots were destroyed or disabled and
were either dumped into the sea or stored in deep
warehouses. The first wave of virus infection found
few systems beyond infrastructure to infect or
destroy, and the world suffered few losses.
<P>
However, a systems engineer for one of the resorts who
had refused transport outsystem took over one of the
abandoned resorts, and deliberately exposed its
deactivated robotic staff to a Priest strain Virus egg
he had acquired from an unsuspecting free trader.
After rallying the newly infected robots to his godly
rule, Tut began to pacify the world under his control
in a brutal campaign of conquest. The Vargr rulers
were in a severely disorganised state following the
Collapse, and Tut's armies quickly overcame their
feeble resistance and rounded up the island bound
population into concentration camps. Several Vargr
escaped the sweeps, however, and were able to alert
nearby RQS and Regency Navy operatives of their grim
circumstances. An undercover team were able to sneak
on the world, recapture one of the isolated camps, and
arm its inmates with heavy weapons that enabled them
to destroy Tut's army in a quick campaign.
<P>
Tut himself barely survived his overthrow, and fled to
a surviving deep water mining facility. In the
meantime the newly liberated Vargr fell to conflict
among themselves, enthusiastically using their new
weapons upon each other in internecine wars, giving
the recalcitrant dictator time to reorganise his
forces. Eventually he contacted and secured the
services, through both money and charisma, of a roving
Suedzuk corsair fleet in nearby Millions Subsector.
The Red Pelts began to raid Rroerruerz, and Tut was
soon back in control of the major settlements. However
resistance to his rule was better armed and
coordinated, and he was beginning to suffer from a
psychotic mental state. After a Regency raid destroyed
the Red Pelt base on his world in 1144, his sanity
crumbled entirely, and he was summarily executed by a
Vargr warlord.
<P>
<B>Warm Jupiter:</B> A gas giant found in a solar system's
habitable zone. The mild temperatures and solar
radiation of this region moderates the violent climate
and conditions of gas giants. Generally these worlds
have a high amout of water vapor in their upper
atmospheres, and nearly all gas giants that boast life
are these kinds of worlds. Warm Jupiters are highly
prized, for their moon assemblages have a high
percentage chance of possessing one or more habitable
worlds. Ship crews also prefer the gentler cloud
layers of these worlds as frontier refuelling stops,
as they lack the temperature and climate extremes of
more normal gas giants.
