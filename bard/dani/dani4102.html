Locked away in his low berth, Baron Arellano is probably the last of the Civil War era combatents
(604 - 622)
<P>
A flightly, vainglorious man with a fixation on "My Destiny of Greatness", he was an eccentric noble
on the raw frontier of the Spinward Marches. Half of the systems were still unsettled, and he spent
most of the time acting as defacto judge on his homeworld, lawless Regina.
<P>
As Emperor battled Emperor back in Core, Arellano got the idea that his Calling has arrived. He
declared himself Emperor, and managed to raise up a ragtag fleet of armed merchants and patrol
cutters before leaving for Core.
<P>
He never left the Marches. Grand Admiral Arabellatra Alkalikoi sent a minor task force to stop the
Baron. Althought they never quite caught him, they did force him to abandon his half-baked plans and
live the pirate life. Time after time he'd devise a Rube Goldberg scheme to get past the task force,
and time after time it would blow up in a wild and wolly manner.
<P>
Finally, he was forced to abandon his fleet, and in 618 retired to his hideaway on 728-907. On a
whim, he set the controls to 1201 and retired to see what the glorious future would hold.
<P>
BTW: Baron de la Arellano is dedicated to the memory of the French Emperor Napoleon III, who once
tried to conquer France by loading a ship with about 50 ruffians, and crossing the Channel to France
and Glory!
<P>
Well, it didn't _quite_ work out... but he later did get himself elected Persident, and two years later
proclaimed himself Emperor.
<P>
P.S. at the time of the Civil War...
