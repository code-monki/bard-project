<UL><B>Background:</B>
   <UL>Treste was born on Oriflamme in 1168, to 
      parents who worked for the newly formed Daishow 
      Trust.  They raised her to be dedicated to the 
      Trust. When the Trust started to raise a unit for 
      the Oriflamme Marines, she joined up. The Marines 
      recognized her talent, and commissioned her as an 
      officer.  She specialized in counter-insurgency 
      and guerrilla warfare. After the conquest of 
      Spencer she was promoted and sent in to eliminate 
      resistance. She has instituted draconian measures 
      designed to eliminate support for the rebellion. 
      Her efforts have proven effective, rebel activity 
      has fallen by 45%.</UL>
