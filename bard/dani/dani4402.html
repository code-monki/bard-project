   <UL>
Mr. O'Connor is a slim, kindly old man with a warm voice. His long face - graced with laugh lines -
and gracious manners hardly seems to belong to a professional psychopath, but it does.
<P>
Born in the corrupt Kingdom of Siev perogy on Prozol/Rylanor/Spinward Marches, his intelligence and lack of scrples eventually landed him
a place in the local Secret Service. However, while a majjor revolt seemed about to topple the
Kingdom, he judiciously sold out several of his fellow agents while refining his image as "The Wise
Old Man" to his subordinates, thus protecting his safety in both camps.
<P>
At 1177, after the Kingdom was 'unexpectedly' overthrown, O'Connor found a new position as an
enforcer for SuSAG. Reliable and discreet, he would carefully research and observe his target before
striking, by either gliding a blade across the unsuspecting victim's jugular or by flicking a
monofiliment pumpknife into the base of the skull, again from the back. Only rarely would he resort to
the rifle, an "inelegant instrument", not quite as fine a kill as the knife.
<P>
O'Connor usually is sent after "white collar" criminals who threatened the company (both employees
and otherwise). Even though the divided and (largely) corrupt local police looked the other way, a
"posting to Porozol" is quietly dreaded by SuSAG managers in Rylanor subsector.
