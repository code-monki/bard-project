<UL><B>Background:</B>
   <UL>

 Oleido is born on Spires 1176. Because of his intelligence,
 education  and  strong  wish to 'feel the stars' he managed to visit

 the second class of the an astonishing career. After two  special
 operations  he  leaves the RCN with the rank of a Lieutenant. He
 already owns an old merchant starship called <I>Memory of Trees</I>.
 The <I>Memory</I> is a relic 400-ton merchant.
 The RCES came to him with the
 plan to do a rimward exploration in exchange for a new  recovered
 jump-3 engine. He agreed.
 <P>
 Oleido is a peaceful man, carefully thinking  man.  Other  people
 might  call  him  a  slow thinker, but he need to reason a matter
 from all sides first before he take a decission. He hates cruelity,
 loud  words,  and toughtless actions. He's good in following
 long or difficult plans and will neither give up nor stop it.  He
 really  beliefs  in success and seems to force it. No RCN officer
 ever managed to force Oleido to cut his long brown hair or remove
the typical Spiriheadband.
