<UL><B>Occupation:</B> Oriflamme Assemblyman - Leader of the Humanist Right</UL>
<UL><B>Attributes:</B> <TT>5878C9-B</TT></UL>
<UL><B>Background:</B>
   <UL>Jonas was born on Oriflamme on 24/V/1164 to a 
      moderately powerful technarch family. He attended 
      the Nemyer Refounded University(NRU) and studied 
      Psychology, going on to obtain an advanced degree. 
      His training gave him a strong understanding of 
      why people behave and act the way they do, but 
      instead of learning this out of any scientific 
      curiousity, Jonas sought to best learn how to 
      manipulate individuals. Jonas also had a keen 
      interest in the history of the old Solomani 
      Confederation and was fascinated with their 
      philosphies of racial superiority, specifically 
      over nonhumans. He entered the government 
      apparatus of Nemyer right out of school and proved 
      such a capable administrator that he quickly rose 
      through the ranks. With the arrival of the Hiver 
      and the formation of the Dawn League, Jonas found 
      a new enemy and a threat to his racial beliefs in 
      races like the Hiver and Schalli. It was repugnant 
      to him that the League had to a rely on the help 
      of a race as alien as the Hivers to survive and 
      then flourish. The decision to allow the Schalli, 
      a race he felt completely unsuited to interstellar 
      travel, full citizenship with voting rights was 
      also a sharp thorn in Jonas' side. Jonas was still, 
      however, a strong proponent of the Dawn League, 
      and the Reformation Coalition that replaced it, as 
      he saw this as his quickest way to greater power. 
      His strong personality and keen political sense 
      won him a seat in the Assembly fairly easily. He 
      has since risen in power and prestige, chairing 
      the Foreign Governments Relations Committee. His 
      policies on dealing with individual worlds have 
      been quite impressive, and he is widely respected 
      for his ability to get what is best for the RC out 
      of deals with individual worlds. He is advocating 
      swift action against Solee and cautions that such 
      tin-pot empires cannot be coddled or taken lightly. 
      His handling of relations with the Hiver is 
      equally heavy-handed, and although he must tread 
      on political thin ice to avoid alienating 
      potential supporters, he makes it no secret that 
      he does not like the RC's unnatural dependence on 
      their Hiver neighbors.</UL>

<UL><B>Appearance:</B>
   <UL>Jonas is a handsome man in his late 30's with 
      a light, wiry frame, a strong face with a 
      pronounced chin and large steel-blue eyes. His 
      hair is black, but is showing signs of silver here 
      and there. His demeanor is always relaxed and open. 
      He tries to make people comfortable around him and 
      is very animated when explaining his views or 
      trying to win someone over. His has a very strong 
      personality and tends to dominate any conversation 
      in which he's involved.</UL>
</UL>
<UL><B>Personality:</B>
   <UL>It's hard not to like Jonas. He's spent years 
      crafting his personality and demeanor to make 
      others feel at ease around him...to trust him. He 
      is also a very emotional man but has learned to 
      focus those emotions and channel them into 
      whatever goal he is currently trying to obtain. 
      All this is a sham, of course. Jonas sees people 
      as good only for his own advancement. He loves to 
      be in control and will push for such positions 
      whenever it is appropriate. He is a very skilled 
      manipulator with the attitude of a born salesman. 
      He does however become noticeably uncomfortable 
      when around aliens. He is specifically very 
      uncomfortable around Hiver, who see him for the 
      manipulator he is, and he will try to avoid direct 
      dealings with them. His attitude towards other 
      races, like the Schalli, tends to be a bit more 
      arrogant, as he sees them as less than equals. 
      This will not come out too strongly, however, as 
      Jonas does not want to tip his hand regarding his 
      true feelings. It might be better expressed as an 
      aloof or callous attitude rather than outright 
      disdain.</UL>
</UL>
<UL><B>Motivation:</B>
   <UL><I>Spade Queen:</I> Jonas is ruthless. There 
      is no better word to describe his drive to attain 
      power and position. He will let nothing stand in 
      his way, but is not such a fool that he would act 
      carelessly or in a way that might endanger him.</UL>
   <UL><I>Spade 9:</I> This goes along with his 
      quest for power, to perhaps one day obtain the 
      position of Secretary General.</UL>
</UL>
<UL><B>Refereeing Bigalow:</B>
   <UL>Jonas Bigalow is a major villain if there 
      ever was one. And worse for the PC's, he's a 
      likeable villain. He comes across as very 
      charismatic and friendly, untill he is crossed, 
      and then he will stop at nothing to disgrace, 
      remove, or dominate that which has threatened his 
      control of his surroundings. Worse yet, Jonas is 
      good for the Coalition, in a certain way. He cares 
      very much that the Coalition thrive and expand, as 
      this will mean more power for him. He is cunning 
      and ruthless in his deals with governments the RC 
      is currently in contact with and always manages to 
      get the best deal possible for the RC. He is an 
      outspoken opponent of the Solee Empire and was one 
      of the first in the Assembly to speak out in favor 
      of swift military action to curtail the expansion 
      of the Empire. Jonas is the leader of the Humanist 
      Right, a small political faction in the Assembly 
      dedicated to removing or limiting the Schalli 
      right to vote on the grounds that they are 
      unsuited for space travel. He is also a critic of 
      the Hiver and their continued presence in the RC. 
      Many Assemblymen, mostly from his native Oriflamme, 
      tacitly agree with his views, but do not want to 
      throw in completely with him, as they feel that is 
      too radical a step, for now. His true hatred of 
      these alien races may come from his lack of an 
      understanding of how to control them. Jonas hates 
      not being in control and any bills or proposals he 
      is involved in he will try to dominate. His 
      ultimate ambition, of course, is to one day 
      replace Maggart as Secretary General, but he will 
      not advertise this, preferring to nudge others to 
      his way of thinking, as has always been his way. 
      Jonas can be a powerful ally in certain affairs, 
      and he uses this to curry the favor he needs for 
      his own goals.</UL>

<UL><B>Possessions:</B> </UL>
<UL><B>Quotes:</B>
   <UL>"I'm not questioning the Schalli's right to 
      be citizens, I'm questioning their desire to have 
      interstellar culture thrust upon them..."</UL>
   <UL>"Ah, my old friends, what can I help you with..."</UL>
   <UL>"You may want to side with me on this issue, 
      lest it come out where you stood on the Solee 
      issue now that they've proven a little less 
      friendly than first anticipated."</UL>
   <UL>"The Hivers control our technology, they 
      dominate our foreign policy, they even ride in our 
      starships as 'advisors'. How much more of our 
      lives are we going to let them control?"</UL>
