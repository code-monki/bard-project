The Third Armored Regiment is the elite group of Oriflamme 
Marines.  Its history traces back to the original settlement 
of Oriflamme during the Rule of Man.  While most military 
organizations have fanciful nicknames, the Third Armored 
Regiment is simply referred to as The THIRD.  During the 
Solomani Rim War an Imperial Army General called them 
"the Devil's own Regiment" for their forceful resistance 
of the Imperial invasion.  This saying has become the 
unofficial slogan of The THIRD.<P>

Before the Rebellion the Regiment was equipped with battle 
dress.  The Collapse, however, made the upkeep of battle 
dress difficult, and by 1153 The THIRD was forced to the 
conclusion that within 3 years it would no longer be 
able to support enough battle dress troops to make up 
an entire Regiment.  The Oriflamme Generals decided to augment 
The THIRD with cybernetics instead. Oriflamme was able to 
produce TL-9 and a few TL-10 cybernetic devices.  Most members 
of the THIRD possess two to four cybernetic devices.  Now that 
Oriflamme has joined the Coalition and it has access to battle 
dress that has been produced off world, The THIRD has been 
fully re-equipped with battle dress, but still augments with 
cybernetics. The THIRD also equips all of its troops with 
both Slow and Fast drugs.<P>

The THIRD is an elite unit, and only admits marines that have 
already proven themselves in service to Oriflamme.  The THIRD 
is only used as an assault unit. If a piece of ground is to be 
taken and the opposition is strong, The THIRD is sent in. They 
are never used for garrison duty, peace keeping missions, or as 
show troops.  The unit is often dropped in dangerous positions
behind enemy lines without adequate support.  Their tactics 
tend to emphasize speed and destruction.<P>

The THIRD is only a Regiment, and as such it is commanded by a 
Colonel.  There can only be one Colonel in The THIRD at any 
given time.  If the existing Colonel is offered a promotion, 
he must revert to the standard Marines to accept. Most THIRD 
officers are too proud to transfer to an ordinary unit.<P>
