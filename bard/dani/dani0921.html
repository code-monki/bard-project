<UL><B>Background:</B> <UL>
        Background: Homeworld - Oriflamme; Parents - Unknown
(streetkid); Terms before contact - 3 (1 term after contact)
<p>
         <b>Term 1</b>: Army. Joined the army of his local Technarch as
cannonfodder, though due to hisgreat strength and endurance he rose to
carry a proper gun (Machine Gunner). Highlight of this tour was when his
company was  instructed to put down a 'rebellion'(Food riot) in his home
town. Terry found it enjoyable duty, even if the 'rebels' seemed to be
sadly lacking weapons and more intent on finding food!!
<p>
    <b>Note</b>: IMTU Oriflamme is a TED who adapted just enough to be admitted
to the Dawn league when it realised the benefits to be gained. I Role
Played the above firefight to determine Terrys reaction to firing on
starving families. He just grinned and muttered something about not
needing to find cover whilst firing into the crowds. :-(. Out of
character Matt hated me for this.<p>
          <b>Term 2</b>: Army. After his first tour he applied for Special
forces Training, he made the interview stage (having passed the physical
and weapons handling), but failed after mentioning the foodriot
situation. He Spent the next 4 years incredibly bored doing garrison
duty in godforsaken places.<p>

    <b>Note</b>: The SF weren't concerned about civil liberties, just that he
should have kept his mouth shut. <p>

                 <b>Term 3</b>: Special
Forces. Having learnt his lesson Terry got into SF training and passed
with flying colours. His hitch in the Rangers went quietly except for
one strange incident where his squad was detailed to guard a wilderness
radio site in the middle of a massive military exercoise area for 14
days. At the end of  this period they were joined by some very senior
officers and at least one Technarch (he doesn't know who).  Later that
night a starship landed and negotiations took place between the crew and
the generals, at the end of which a large quantity of crates were
off-loaded. A few days later Terry took part in the testing of some new
firearms. (He was very impressed)<p>

   <b> Note</b>: The ship was a Guild ship and the weapons were relic ACR's.
Terry saw the Guild emblem, but didn't realise the significance of it.<p>

          <b>Term 4</b>: Oriflamme Marine. With recontact and joining the Dawn
League, Oriflamme formed a marine contingent, most SF personnel formed
the initial cadre, Terry amongst them. The marines were perfect for
Terry and he didn't seem to notice the factthat he had several near
fatal accidents in training and afterwards, nor did he notice that many
his old team, had accidents (mostly fatal). Terrys crowning acheivement
in the Marines came during the subduing of Spencer; when he and his
squad orbital assaulted the main enemy Communication and sensor depot
station. From the moment they landed he realised they had problems when
none of his officers   were on the ground, things rapidly got worse when
the heavy tank company (that was suppossed to be a continent  way),
opened fire with APFSDSDU ammo killing his buddy with the first (lucky)
shot. A horrendous game of cat and mouse with three tanks followed, with
the tanks being destroyed at the cost of half the squad followed.   Then
the enemy equivelant of the SAS turned out to be defending the station
and Terry and his 4 surviving  buddies were glad to be relieved by other
troops 16 hours later. After this operation terry requested and got
transfer to the RCES.<p>

    <b> Notes</b>: Terry's Technarch definetly doesn't want the RC to become
aware of his trading with the Guild.  Unfortunately all his plans to
kill Terry have failed so far. Matt isn't even aware of any such plot to
kill him!!He just thought he was having his normal bad luck.<p>
