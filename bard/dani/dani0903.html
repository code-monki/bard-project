<UL><B>Background:</B>
   <UL> Ash Marler was born on the planet Marax, during the reign of Ushugaam I.  His parents sent him away to military academy as a young lad.  Here he learned how to be an obediant soldier for Ushugaam.  The academy determined that he had the reflexes and aptitude to make a fine pilot and he was sent to Flight Academy.  Over the last few years, he served with distinction especially against a rebellion in the Pontaine Acchipelago.  After Ushugaam II captured the DLS Helios, Marler was assigned to its crew.  Ushugaam II the doesn't really trust his officers, so he as extra officers assigned to the crew to watch the other officers.  Marler was made the Second Flight Officer, this is mainly a back up pilot and watchdog position.  Marler did well in this assignment, he did quite well here. He was given a Silver Suncrest with Dual Rays for his actions on Tinyid. <P>

When the crew of the ANV Argo came to Marax and agreed to train an astrogator in making jump 3 manuvers, Marler was choosen for this choice assignment.  He was given orders to learn as much as possible about the RC, and its intentions and how it would react to Marax.  He was also given a small fortune in gems to purchase weapons and technology to build up Marax's strength.
