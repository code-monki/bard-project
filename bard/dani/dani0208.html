<UL><B>Background:</B>
   <UL>
   Icarus was born on Shenandoah to fairly well off parents.  His parents owned a large ranch.  Icarus spent much of his free time in the wilderness.  He learned how to ride the family's poni, hunt, fish, trap game.  He and his uncle spent several months each summer backpacking across the ranch.  Icarus was also a patriot and loved his planet and its people.  When he reached adulthood, he joined the Citizen's militia. The instructors made him a sniper.  His enlistment passed fairly uneventfully, until Shenandoah joined the Reformation Coalition.  Icarus volunteered for the Fifth company and was assigned to RCES Headquarters on Aubaine. Since then he has gone on several missions and carried out his mission well.  He has worked with the same two partners for four years, and they make a tight working group.
   <P>
   He is fascinated with Aubaine, as the water world is so different from the alpine wilderness he grew up with.  He is often found at the beach and has taken up scuba diving.  He has befriended several Schalli, who he often goes diving with.
   <P>
   Icarus is a quiet man, who keeps his feelings to himself and to his closest friends  On missions, he doesn't engage in small talk and focuses on the mission.  He strongly believes in the RC and its mission of bringing civilization to the Wilds.  He regards his skills much like a surgeon.  By carefully removing certain key individuals, greater violence can be averted.  He has avoided any romantic intrests as he knows the life of a sniper is highly dangerous and he doesn't want to leave a family without a father.
