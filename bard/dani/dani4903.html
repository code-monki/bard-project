<UL><B>Background:</B>
   <UL>Pidiris Razlehmehid is a large, rather gregarious fellow, both strong and intelligent. He lives to sing,
but also enjoys a bit of roughhousing and carousing wherever he goes. Like about 30% of Darrians, he
doesn't believe that humans originated on Terra, putting that belief down to typical Solomani
supremist dogma.
<P>
Razlehmehid is a strong, powerful tenor, and a member of a Darrian 'Tengobhes' group of singers.
Tengobhes groups specialize in Ancient Darrian Hymns and chants in a style most closely
resembling Islamic forms of singing, often spin-dancing at the same time. Of course, Razlehmehid
himself is not a believer in the long-dead Yalema faith.
<P>
His Tengobhes group is composed of four men (including himself, there's Dulyunal Zgehngehbher,
Pune Mbalzihrer, and Zlaneyr Nyeghihndihligh). After several marginally profitable tours in the
Darrian Confederation, they have decided to take their first tour in the Regency, where Tengobhes
singing is still a rarity. Because they can't speak Anglic - and are still in culture shock - the other
three singers have unofficaly made Razlehmehid their leader.
<P>
Razlehmehid is married, and has two young daughters - and a nephew - to care for. Whenever
possible, he visit's them back on Darrian, where he was born and grew up.
