<B>1160:</B> Born to mid-level technical managers in the capital of Baldur, an only child who quickly showed promise of being
extraordinary aptitude with technical items he was sent on an accelerated technical training course reserved for the very
brightest of Baldur's young.  He spent his  early years studying hard to live up to the heroes of the Balduri nation, those
selfless technicians, scientists and mechanics whose dedication over many years had allowed the world to survive.  He was
fascinated with these peoples attempts to hold onto what was left of the Hi-Tech world and became devoted to the ideals
of self-sacrifice, teamwork and the nobility of attempting to recreate the technical wonders of the recent past.<P>
<B>1176-1179:</B> He enters university as an engineering student and passes each course with flying colours, the investment in
his technical training is clearly paying off.<P>
<B>1180-1183:</B> Having graduated with honours he continues to study for his doctorate in advanced Engineering and
because of his outstanding work spends much of the next 4 years working on one of the few working fusion reactors.
During the course of this work he develops an interest in starship design and robotics and studies these subjects in his
spare time.<P>
<B>1184-1192:</B> Works as a civil engineer for one of the major Technarchs of Baldur, gaining several promotions for his
work and soon becomes a trouble-shooter, visiting many dangerous or vital sites requiring his knowledge. <P>
<B>1193-1196:</B> Is the third listed candidate (Behind two very well connected Technarch children) from Baldur, for the
newly established Hiver Technical Academy on Aubaine. Excels at the academy.<P>
<B>1197-1199:</B> Serves with the newly formed Dawn League, visiting some of the recontacted worlds and regularly
reporting home to pass on his newly acquired skills to others. Is finally selected as Chief engineer on the <I>Aube</I> (A First
Twelve mission!!!). <P>
<B>1199-1200:</B> Is held prisoner on Montezuma for several harrowing months, during which he is tortured extensively,
before the <I>Ashtabula</I> rescue mission recovers him.  His health is severely damaged and his mental state is poor, however
he is able to assist onboard the Ashtabula during this cruise.<P>
<B>1201:</B> Having recovered from most of his physical injuries (His left leg will always be 1/2 inch shorter and his joints
ache in wet weather).  Anvil is passed fit for service. He retires from the Service and seeks a  more peaceful job where the
demons of his imprisonment will not haunt him.<P>
