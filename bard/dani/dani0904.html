<UL><B>History:</B>
<UL> Autumn was born on the planet Lucifer in 1178 to wealthy merchants.
Her parents did not venture into space, mearly trading things across
the planet.  Autumn was brought up helping with the family business
and intended to continue working with the company.  This changed when 
Autumn met Capt Anne Bowlden of the free trader <I>Whispering Dawn</I>. Autumn 
immediately  became infatuated with space and exploration. She bugged her 
parents until they allowed her to sign on with the <I>Whispering Dawn</I>. 
Her parents gave the Captain a profitable lot of furs and wools, as 
a bribe to take their daughter and to watch over her.  She was a quick 
study and was made an officer within one year, and promoted after three
years. <BR><BR>

The <I>Whispering Dawn</I> made many journeys into Alpha Crucis 
and the trailing portions of the Solomani Rim. Autumn became second in
command of the ship after 9 years.  Autumn began to see that the 
expanding Reformation Coalition needed experienced officers.  She
was proud to see her homeworld becoming part of something big.
After a great deal of soul searching she decided to leave the <I>Whispering
Dawn</I> and join the RCES.  While her application was going through,
she was contacted by Assemblyman MacBaen, and offered a job aboard 
the Argo.  The mission was pretty much the same as the RCES and the
pay was much better. So she signed up as the starboard gunner.<BR><BR>
