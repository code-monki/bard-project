<B>Name:</B> Yuling Jones<br>
<B>Age:</B> 34<br>
<B>Race:</B> Human<br>
<B>Occupation:</B> Representative to the Assembly of Worlds<P>
 
<B>Background:</B>Yuling was the only daughter of Edmond and Telia Jones. As such she inherited the entire Jones fortune in 1190 at the age of 24, when both of her parents died in a boating accident. The family fortune had been made by her great-great grandmother in the air raft business, in the late 900s.  The Jones family was careful to invest their fortune, so by 1160 it had grown to several billion credits.  Knowing that she was going to inherit this immense wealth, Yuling never felt a need to pursue a career and after college, she became involved with various charities to help the less fortune.  She pursued charities as a part time vocation. She spent  much of her remaining time at the country club and at the yacht club.  Some of her favorite charities were the Clean Seas Foundation, which wants to keep the seas pristine and safe for the native Schali, the Child Salvation Fund, which helps poor children get a start in life, and the Vras National Museum Fund, which helps raise money for the musuem.  She is on the board of the directors of the museum.
<P>
Her contributions to these charities was not just monetary, she donated her time.  She is not afraid to get her hands dirty and help out at the lowest levels. Being rich, single, attractive, and a major philanthropist has made her quite well known, and mader her a minor celebrity.  She is always on the A-list for parties and the like.  She knows most of the rich and famous on Vras. Though she has had various long-term relationships, she has never married, and is considered one of the most eligible single women on the planet.  
<P>
Though most active in the above mentioned charities she donates money to other deserving causes.  She has endowed a fund to provide scholarships to allow Schalli to attend mainland universities, and another scholarship fund for poor children.
<P>
In 1199 she and a group of friends went on a six month tour of the surrounding worlds.  The conditions that people lived in on the several of the worlds shocked her. Especially the conditions on Phoebus and Lancer.  When she returned to Aubaine in early 1200, she began organizing several aid missions to the less fortunate worlds around Aubaine. She set up a scholarship fund, the Telia Jones Scholarship, to bring several dozen students to Aubaine for an education each year. In exchange these students had to agree to four years of public service after leaving school. This could be as a teacher, social worker, government worker or volunteer, anything that would improve the lives of their fellow humans.  Students from Phoebus, Schall, Lancer, Spires and Vezina are eligible.  
<P>
When the Coalition was formed, and Aubaine announced elections for their representatives to the Assembly of Worlds, Yuling decided to run.  As a member of the Assembly, she could steer the RC into helping uplift people. 
With her numerous connections in both human and schali communities, and her 
personal celebrity, she was able to win by a sizable margin.  She ran on a platform that stated that Aubaine was the most fortunate in the Coalition, and that they had a duty to help those less fortunate.  
<P>
She doesn't really care about where the RC stops and starts, she just wants to help people to better their own lives. She wants to help the less fortunate both in the RC and outside.  She feels the AO was one of the worst mistakes the infant RC has made, because it limits who the RCES and RCN can assist.  She is a firm believer in the RCES bootstrap missions.  
She is not in favor of the use of force to change governments in the Wilds, believing that doesnt change beliefs and conditions that allowed those governments to survive. Instead she perfers trade and diplomacy to gradually change perceptions on Wild worlds.
<P>
   

<B>Appearence</B>: She is a strikingly beautiful women, and she should be after having numerous biosculpting operations.  She was not unattractive before, but the biosculpting has made her ravishing.  She is a tall woman, with long straight black hair, which she styles in various fashions depending on her mood.  Her clothes are designed by the best fashion designers and she always has just the right accessory.  
<P>
<B>Skills</B>: Jones has no combat skills, and she has few truly marketable skills. She is quite well educated, being highly knowledgable about history, litecture, and the life sciences. Her years working with charities has given her administrative skills, which has served her well in the Assembly.
