   Origionally from Sagan/Deneb sector, the main Huntington line perished to the last man fighting the
   Vargr hordes, leaving only a few survivors of the lesser, non-hereditary noble line to carry on the
   family name and tradition of service. Even by 1200, Sagan has remained unvisited by any Regency
   craft, formally or unoffically.

   Beliefs:
   Dame Oralia - a life (non-hereditary) peer, ennobled 1194 - fiercely believes in both in her family
   and in the Regency. A devout Roman Catholic - a typical `Solomani noble' religion - she also
   believes in the place of the nobility as ordained in God's Order.
   <P>
   However, her Oath of Feality to the Regent forbits her from striving to neutralize the Democratic
   Reforms, as the Regent *is* the Will of God in temporal matters, as far as she is concerned.
   <P>
   Unfortunately, her charismatic younger brother Brian not only opposes the Reforms but believes that
   violence can be justifiably used to stop them. In his influential telebook "Honour Betrayed", he
   declares "<B>The Democratic Reforms</B> is an illegal attempt to ursurp Noble authority, proclaimed by a
   Regent who dares to take what Cleon has given. Deneb will soon be as dead as Illeish, if we allow
   the use of majority votes as a shoddy cloak for the theft our our rights, our property, and our
   heritage!"
   <P>
   That's Brian's view. Dame Oralia's view is that her brother is commiting high treason against
   divinely-annointed authority. If she ever has the opportunity to kill him for disgracing the family
   name, she will gladly take it. Currently, however, not even MoJ agents can find Brian.
   Her other family consists of  her husband David, four grown children (all in the Regency Civil Service), and two large Clover
hounds.
   <P>
   Ambition:
   Originally a Crown Attorney, she made the bench in 1191. She has the reputation of a severe, hanging
   judge of ice-pure integrity. Her goal is to eventually become Law Lord of an important system in a
   decade, eventually apexing in a *hereditary* title.
   <P>
   Current goals:
   as a judge of a recently-absorbed system - Flammorion was annexed after a short action in 1188 -
   Dame Oralia's mail goal is to set Imperial Justice as a perfect, unquestionable standard in the eyes of
   all Flammorionii. "The way that a civilization dispenses justice is the clearest indication of that
   civilization's worth" one of her professors in law taught, and the Knight intends to clearly indicate the
superior worth of Imperial Civilization to all others.

<UL><B>Appearance:</B>
   <UL>
the Dame's clothing tends to be quite conservative and understated. However, a Regency royalty
watcher or a fashion expert would appreciate her very subtle (and very expensive) taste in clothes, a
style that fewer and fewer lesser nobles can afford nowadays.
</UL>
</UL>
<UL><B>Personality:</B>
   <UL>Tall and regal, Dame Oralia tend's to give the rarefied air of a cold, superdignified noble. This is the
result of training and habit, but also preferance: she doesn't like to associate with anyone of lower
Social Standing then "9". About the only crack of humanity she is willing to show in public is affection
to her God, her family, and family servants, and even then it's more of a loving tenderness than a
powerful bear hug.  </UL>
