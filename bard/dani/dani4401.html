<UL><B>Background:</B>
   <UL>

   Born   as one of two clones on Vinorian/Rhylanor/Spinward Marches, he now resides on
   Asculi (FR00212-9), aka Gillarm Zeta Ay, in the Vinorian System. A thin ring, orbiting the gas giant
   Mallowan.
   The station - called, appropriately enough, Asculi Station - has 600 pernament residents, and 4000
   temporary residents.
<P>
Born and raised as one of two clones (his brother, four days earlier from the artifical womb, is also
named Flott. The difference is in the emphasis of the "Fl" with our Flott, rather than the "ott" with his
brother.)
<P>
The brothers were raised by professional parents, in a 'pod' of 10 (that is 5 cloned twins). They
chose to give their Corporate Service in Provider Terraforming's corporate army. Afterwards, they
were fortunate enough to continue their affiliation with Provider itself - rather than one of it's lesser
subsidaries or subcontractors - as managers.
<P>
They did well in the Company - the elder Flott was promoted and transferred to corporate
headquarters at Regina, the younger obtained a good-paying position in Transport at Asculi Station.
However, someone at Head Office decided to sell Asculi Station to the station employees in 1195.
They selected Mr. Trazyen to be their leader/spokesman, as well as Spaceport Administrator.
<P>
Asculi station was originally a corporate SDB base to protect Mallowan: it still acts a subcontractor
of Provider to guard Vinorian's sole gas giant with 2 SDB's. More and more, however, it's acting as
an unoffical "smuggler's cove" of in-system Provider merchantman acting as part-time smugglers,
working to circumvent Vinorian's high tarrif walls. About 6 of Provider's 8 spaceship's are involved,
and all make the Vinorian-Asculi run regularly. Also, 2-3 jumpships come here also, some on
legitamate business, some not.
<P>
Mr. Trazyen is looking for anyone who can drum up more out-system business for his 'little
operation'. More importantly, he's desperate for information concerning Provider's response - he
*knows* that they know what's going on, but they do nothing at all. (Perhaps it's because they
_can't_ do anything (every Provider ship is involved in some way, after all)? It's too minor to act
against? Or are they quietly negotiating (sp!) with a starmerc? If bribery is doing the work, who's
bribing who? (His little 'bargain' with the SDB captains is common knowledge outside of Vinorian
itself)

<UL><B>Appearance:</B>
   <UL> Standard company overalls. Unusually, he prefers computer printouts rather than a commplate, since
he has only the weakest familiarity with computers. White; slick, limp black hair, no beard. Brown
eyes and a nondescript Regency accent. Has a holster, but usually empty (despite the low station
law level, no guns or weapons are permitted on your person. Excluding that, what you do is your own
business.)

Unrefined and lower-class, but cautious. (his high 'social rating' is derived from his position, not his
orgins.) Seperates business from private life. A good conversationalist and salesman when the
situation warrents. Conventional sense of morality... except when it comes to smuggling ("Why
shouldn't people get what they want?")
