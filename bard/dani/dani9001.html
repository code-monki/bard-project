<h3>Historical Overview</h3> During the Imperial Civil War the
coreward regions of the Domian of Deneb were invaded
by large corsair and freebooting military units from
several nearby Vargr states in Gvurrdon, Tuglikki and
Provence Sectors. Upon notification of Strephon's
assassination many neighboring Vargr, already heavily
influenced by the Oekhsos tirades, perceived a
marvelous oppurtunity for pillage and conquest in the
weakened spinward sectors of the Third Imperium. In
Gvurrdon, the Kforuzeng corsairs enjoyed a renaissance
of interest and power, and raided heavily into
Aramis/Spinward Marches. In Tuglikki, the Assemblage
of 1116 formed solely as a military adversary for the
Domain of Deneb; its military and allied corsairs
inflicted serious losses on the communities and
commerce of coreward subsectors in Deneb. But the most
traumatic injury was inflicted by Vargr states in
Provence:</B> the overrunning of Corridor Sector and the
severance of the main lines of contact and commerce
between the DoD and the main body of the Third
Imperium. By 1119 the Denebians were facing entrenched
Vargr forces across most of their coreward frontier,
and were compelled to abandon many worlds in trailing
Deneb.
<P>
Given enough time, the DoD forces might have prevailed
against these threats, especially after divide-and-
conquer politics had slowed down Aslan encroachers in
the Thinrim enough to permit reinforcement of the
coreward reaches.  Unfortunately for the Domain, the
release of the AI Virus in 1130 made further offensive
operations impossible, and a ceasefire was negotiated
with local Vargr warlords. In 1132 the new Regency of
Deneb declared Vargr and Aslan worlds "fait accompli"
and annexed them back into its borders under the
protection of its new Quarantine. This bold act
partially severed the ties between newly enfranchised
Vargr landlords and their masters and sponsors to
coreward, but it led to several new rounds of
bloodshed between Regency forces and neighboring Vargr
powers, most notably the Assemblage of 1116 in the
campaign romantically known as the Battle of Ashes.
<P>
While these final adjustments, and last few wars were
going on, Virus debuted in the trailing/rimward Vargr
Extents around 1135.  The decimation of the large
states in this region sent refugees flooding to
spinward, destabilising other regions, and carrying
Viral pathogens with them. About the same time that
the Kishkii and her task force was wending on their
deadly errand across Corridor, Virus had finally made
its way around the Windhorn. The Varroeth Empire
collapsed, and tens of billions died. Neighboring
Vargr states  collapsed sequentially afterwards, in
the words of one historian, like a building crashing
down one story at a time.  Billions of refugees
attempted to flee from this deadly onslaught, but most
perished before reaching safe haven.  By 1145 only a
small precarious cluster of states in a one sector
proximity of the Zhodani trailing frontier had
weathered the storm.
<P>
The coreward subsectors of Deneb began to recieve
refugees as early as 1136, mostly prescient or
cautious Vargr who wanted to get out of the way as
quickly as possible. In 1140 Varroeth refugees started
to straggle in, and these were followed by refugees
from several states as Virus cut a swath across
Tuglikki. In 1143 coreward fleets had encountered the
first coreward Vampires, and by 1145 millions of Vargr
refugees had flooded into Deneb from a half dozen
states and myriad non-aligned worlds.  The coreward
frontier worlds suffered decades of war and abuse, and
the subsequent Abandonment had winnowed their
populations; as a result services and supplies for
these refugees were in short supply despite the heroic
efforts of the Regency government and charity relief
organisations.  The situation was only made worse by
the political isolation of fait accompli lords
following the demise of their homelands and sponsoring
states. In the face of this influx many worlds, Fait
Accompli or not, fractured under the strain.
<P>
In the resulting vacuum Vargr refugees often went
hungry, sick and unsheltered, and the traditional
family and pack bonds, already shattered by war,
almost disappeared altogether. Only the strongest and
most charismatic Vargr could prevail in this frenzy,
and slowly these imposed a strict order upon the
refugees, aided in no small part by corsairs and
previously established Vargr politicians and
corporations.  By 1148 the strongest of these
"topdogs" had cobbled together a semblance of order
and had begun to turn their camps and fellow refugees
into communities.
<P>
The chief institution to evolve were the Goenghoedz,
or "Self Community Groups."  These were primarily
fellowships or charitable funds established by the
surviving fait accompli governments, and assisted by
generous Regency financing and donations, that were
run by the refugees themselves. Many were not
originally criminal organisations, having been founded
by Vargr activists and wealthy refugees as a means of
centering relief efforts and/or bringing their needs
to the attention of the Regency government. Initially
they distributed food, blankets and medicines, but
eventually evolved into quasi-bureaucratic entities.
The slowness and disorganisation of the Regency's
inital relief efforts convinced many Vargr that Norris
and his government were untrustworthy or racist at
worst, and inept at best. Many had recieved shabby
treatment from local authorities, and were the subject
of intimidation and threats by vengeful locals.  As
they progressively sorted out their own problems, this
distrust became a critical barrier between local
refugee communities and assimilation into the Regency
mainstream.
<P>
Many of these groups eventually created their own
extralegal methods for self-government, including
taxation and policing.  On many worlds it became
impossible for Regency or local authorities to secure
the cooperation of Goenghoedz and their supporting
groups.  At this time  the Vargr Pack did not formally
exist beyond this petulant passive-aggressiveness,
though the Goenghoedz' tax collection and policing
agencies often ran on their own with little respect
for even the laws drawn up by the refugees themselves.
Education and assimiliation slowly drew the best and
brightest Vargr into the mainstream, and slowly the
camps were consolidated and closed. But these refugees
were followed by tax collectors and their enforcers,
and these groups slowly became outlaws in the legal
sense.
<P>
Aided by generous taxation (extortion) of income from
refugee groups, the Goenghoedz developed along two
parallel tracks. One part was legitimate, and after
the Representational Reforms, these community groups
became political machines for the election of Vargr
represenatives to the Regency Senate. On the other
hand was the growing criminality of the associated
muscle and supporting infrastructure, as the net of
illegality was spread farther to generate further
income. Many Goenghoedz leaders became quite corrupt
For its part, the Regency actually amplified the power
of these groups through a series of poorly thought out
welfare and assistance measures that ended up creating
a wider income base for the Goenghoedz and their
collectors.
<P>
<h3>Pack Organisation</h3> The core of the Pack remains the
Goenghoedz.  Like many human criminal syndicates and
cartels, these are composite organisations consisting
of coexisting legitimate and illegal activities and
parties.  No two Goenghoedz are alike, and the extent
and kinds of activities they engage in vary widely,
even within the proximity of a single refugee camp or
community.  But generally legal and illegal activities
are juxtaposed in a manner that makes it theoretically
difficult for either the authorities or rival groups
from determining vulnerabilities.
<P>
Every Goenghoedz has a Lloengokh, or territory,
assigned to it by the mysterious Udhegvol, or Pack
Guide. The size of this territory is determined by two
factors:</B> the Udhegvol's perception of an individual
groups value, and its own ability to carve out turf
and gain new allegiances. A Lloengokh can be as large
as a system, or as small as a city block.  Most are
generally no larger than a country, though this can be
spread across several systems.  A Goenghoedz is
titled, or sovereign, inside of its turf, and is
entitled to do everything it desires within its
boundaries. Rival gang members, either legitimate or
criminal, can be disposed in any way the current
titleholders see fit, according to the Oekhon, or Code
of Conduct. Turf wars are seen as a natural outcome of
competition between rival groups, and no attempt is
made by the Udhegvol to mediate between warring groups
except where the Udheg as a whole are threatened, or
where excessive violence and bloodshed threaten
profits or territorial cohesion.
<P>
Every world or system with an Udheg operation on it
has a Rroukhthaeghz, or Pack Boss, in charge of it.
This is less formally a hiearchal term than just a
name of convenience; on smaller or less valuable
worlds the Rroukh will be subordinate to capos or
lieutenants on larger or more important worlds. The
Pack Boss is generally responsible for keeping the
peace where different gangs are operating, and making
sure that the Oekhon is observed, and revenue is
collected for the Udhegvol. In the political hiearchy
of the Goenghoedz, the Rroukhthaeghz is nominally in
charge of the planetary council that oversees all
local chapters, and is generally responsible for
schmoozing with local human politicians,
businesspeople and police.
<P>
The general hiearchy of a Udheg chapter starts with
the Khothong, or ward heelers, who handle tax
collection and street level organisation. These are
overseen by a Khounerr, or Street Boss, who runs a
single operation or set of operations from a single
base. The next level are the Alakhighors, which are
either lieutenants who oversee several Khounerr, or
are mid-level managers in Goenghoedz affiliated
businesses, charities or bureaucracies.  Finally there
is the Ngaethaeghz, or Party Boss, the "Capos" that
run a Goenghoedz.  In the feudal world of the Pack,
these are subordinated to a Udhegthaeghz, or
"Godfather" in the romantic retelling of human
journalists and writers, that control all Ghoenghoedz
in a single Udheg.  These in turn report to the
Udhegsoer, the legendary "La Cosa Nostra" of the Pack,
though in reality this is actually a purely political
organisation that has nothing to do with criminal or
commercial enterprise of any kind.
<P>
The Ngaethaegz are the primary bosses, and are
empowered by both the Oekhon with life and death
decisions. Most are more politician than criminal, and
when a Alakhigor graduates to becoming a Mgaethaegz,
it is referred to as a "coming of age" in the Udheg,
with only indirect or covert ties to the seamier
underbelly of their organisations.  Most Ngaethaegz
are Vargr who have their own successful Thoerrets
(legitimate businesses) and are therefore able to
stand up to the scrutiny of local, subsector and
Regency authorities better than their less appealing
colleagues.  Nonetheless, every Party Boss has a squad
of Inksurrang, or assassins, who enforce his or her
authority over the lower echelons, and are the only
who may legitimately order a Ziz, or hit, on an enemy
or threat to their interests.
<P>
Peace is kept, and disputes mediated, by two different
types of emissary. The most common are the
Outhillorgh, an "untouchable" (free from harm or
malice) that nonetheless keeps contact between
neighboring groups at a common grass roots level.
These are essentially couriers that relay general
information between various Goenghoedz. All
Ngaethaeghz also have special subordinates known as
Oekhonguers, who both inspect the lower echelons for
failure to live up to their obligations, and provide
high level negotiations between different groups.
<P>
Above the Goenghoedz, the Pack is more unified by
example and common philosophy than by any
institutions. All Goenghoedz must report to the
Udhegvol, must obey its decrees, and must pay it an
annual tax equal to seven percent of their income.  To
ease organisational tensions, a Udhegthaeghz is
appointed. This Overboss has its own Oekhonguers whose
primary job it is to trace income, and be on the
lookout for betrayal or a failure to comply with the
Oekhon. But for the most part the Udheg makes few
demands of individual groups, and often provides
additional muscle and money to those it perceives as
deserving. No Ngaethaeghz has ever claimed to have met
the Udhegvol in person; rather it conveys its commands
and wishes through special envoys chosen for their
persuasive skills and high charisma. The message that
is conveyed, and the ability of the medium are both
very persuasive it seems, as disloyalty against the
decrees of the Udhegvol are rare.
<P>
The Pack does possess a handful of transcendant
officials and soldiers. Most inter-Goenghoedz money
transfers are handled by the Ethueng, which also
collects tax money for the Udhegvol. The Ethueng are
also solely responsible for money laundering
operations, including those into the Federation of
Arden. Though many individual groups express
reservation at having no control over their finances,
this creates an additional layer of frustration for
Regency investigators who are unable to trace the
means by which Pack money is laundered.  The Udhegvol
also maintains two loyalty assurance groups, the
Fuernuzorg to spinward and the Thengkfelluer to
trailing, who are full paramilitary groups armed with
military grade weaponry, empowered to eliminate
rebellious or disobedient Pack organs.
<P>
<h3>Pack Factions and Associated Groups</h3>

<B>Aegzaeng:</B> Former corsair band in control of namesake
world, formerly Caladib (Deneb 0508). The Aegzaeng
were one time rivals of the Kforuzeng, but were
forcibly absorbed by their enemies in the years before
the Fifth Frontier War.  After the war, the group
became independent again, but without most of their
warships, and they began to hire themselves out to
other Vargr powers as dirtside mercenaries. It was in
support of the Assemblage of 1116 that the group
captured the naval base on Caladib in 1125, a military
feat that was recognised by the Fait Accompli
accomodations of 1131.
<P>
As a political grouping, the Aegzaeng have charted a
maverick course. Their represenatives at the subsector
and Regency levels only carve out alliances of
convenience to accomplish a narrow set of goals, and
they frequently switch sides, and show little or no
ideological consistency.  This has garnered them a
reputation for unreliability among both Regency humans
and other Vargr Fait Accompli powers. The group
accepts the Pack and the underlying Goenars, but
unenthusiastically, and it severely limits the Udheg's
authority and operations on their world. Ironically it
has been one of the few FA worlds to be permitted to
own warships for a planetary navy, a significant
turnaround from the old days.  The group seems to stay
far enough within the Udhegvol's favor to prevent its
extermination by the Fuernuzorg.
<P>
<B>Baknaelur:</B> Refugees from the Baknae Alliance found on
several high population worlds in Pretoria and Magash
Subsectors. The Baknae Alliance's expansionistic
tendencies were replicated by its refugees, most of
whom were military or corsairs that somehow survived
the trip across Tuglikki Sector despite Virus.  This
group dominates most Goenghoedz in these subsectors,
and have a penchant for applying slow but constant
pressure in pursuit of their goals.
<P>
Baknaelur is also the name applied to the culture,
cooking and artifacts imported by the refugees.
Baknaelur cooking is pungent, and spicy if not
painfully hot(the result of Vargr, like Terran
canines, of not having pain receptors in their
palates).  The refugees are well known for their
distinctive architecture and furniture, and one of the
most common legitimate businesses are carpentry and
cabinetry.
<P>
<B>Church of the Chosen Ones:</B> Vargr racial supremacist
religion. The Chosen Ones are an unusual outcome of
the Solomani Hypothesis. The revelation of the Vargr's
uplifting by the Ancients convinced many of them that
their race had been singled out for special treatment,
perhaps as a master race over all other sophonts.  The
COTCO is the only Vargr group to attempt to apply this
doctrine to the rest of the universe. The Church was
younger than the Third Imperium, only being founded in
the 600s after the popularisation of the Solomani
Hypothesis.
<P>
In order that its gospel may reach the rest of the
universe, the Church proselytizes to each and every
sophont its priests encounter. But the bulk of its
recruitment efforts were concentrated among less
enlightened Vargr communities.  Many corsair bands and
oppurtunistic or expansionistic states became frequent
partners of the Church, as its beliefs and theology
were a convenient justifier for their operations,
provided that they were concentrated upon bringing the
faith to nearby sophonts and their interstellar
polties.
<P>
But as with most Vargr institutions, the Church was
rife with political challenge, internal dissent,
ideological schism and outright heresy. In the last
five hundred years of its existence it has been an
institution in name only, with myriad congregations
and individual world hiearchies held together only by
the common cause of its theology, and even that is
open to argument.  Fortunately its theology lacked any
genocidal or extreme xenophobic trends or doctrines,
and most schisms within the church were either
politically motivated, or driven by issues of the best
method of outreach to other sophonts.
<P>
The Church is still active in many parts of the former
Vargr Extents, and among several regions of the
surviving Splinters.  Its activities in the Regency
are not prohibited, but they have been severely
limited by political and cultural concerns.  Most
sects encountered in the Regency will tend to
congregate along the coreward frontier, and are
primarily splinter groups that resemble in
organisation and tenor the "storefront" Christian
Churches of old Terra.  Regency churches are dominated
by two trends:</B> either an active inclusion movement
that welcomes all sophonts in exchange for a softening
of the racial aspect; or a vehemently activist and
nationalist church that nurses the anger, desperation
and fear of unemployed and displaced Vargr.
<P>
<B>Donu-na Crisis:</B> Balkanisation of Donu-Na/Namidshur
(Deneb ) in the 1160s following a major gang war
between rival Goenghoedz. Donu-na's non-existent law
level, and long tradition of government permissiveness
allowed the Pack to set up a large presence on this
world in the 1150s. The situation was complicated by
corruption among the human leadership of this poor
world, many of whom were on Pack payrolls. Several
human communities became fed up with the brazen
activities of the Pack and their human cronies, and
the gang war allowed several to secede from the main
government, and form splinter states. The new states
are rigidly defiant of the Pack, and are patrolled by
private police agencies, most notably those provided
by Ingram Services, to keep them out.
<P>
<B>Ethueng:</B> Kforuzeng splinter group. The Ethueng were
induced in the Antebellum period by Tukera Lines into
forming their own seperate corsair band, with generous
Tukera support of course. After Tukera collapsed, the
band almost broke apart in the face of renewed Kforuz
attacks. But then the band was rescued by an unknown
benefactor, and its members were funneled into a set
of trojan horse businesses in Pretoria subsector
during the 1130s and 40s, only to reemerge as a core
part of the new Vargr Pack in the 1150s. The Ethueng
handle all of the Udheg's major financial
transactions, and provide banking services for
individual Goenghoedz.
<P>
The group is highly secretive, and its membership is
of unknown origin. All Ethueng seem to be recruited in
their youth, and spend about fifteen to twenty years
in training and indoctrination. No Ethueng member will
surrender under interrogation or torture, and all wil
carry a method of suicide on their person. Among other
Pack Members, they are referred to as the "Talking
Moneybags" because of their quiet professionalism, for
they do most of their talking through their actions
rather than direct communication. Regency police call
them "Ghost Dogs" for their ability to disappear or
fade out of sight. Killing or robbing an Ethueng
courier will always trigger intervention by either the
Fuernuzorg or Thengkfelluer hit squads.
<P>
<B>Fueznuzorg:</B> Former special ops branch of the
Kforuzeng. Since the Collapse it has been promoted
into the main representing body of the Kforuzeng
within the Regency. Fueznuzorg in general is atypical
of a Udheg grouping, and may not really be a part of
the formal Udheg at all. The Fueznuzorg do not have a
single world they dominate, and hold very little
territory at all. But then their job is a special one:</B>
the intimidation and supression of rebellious Udheg
factions. The Fueznuzorg are concentrated in
Aramis/Spinward Marches, but have allied or associated
chapters scattered across the Regency, most notably in
coreward Deneb.
<P>
<B>Goenghoedz:</B> Formal name for Vargr nationalist and
political groups that enlist and support the Vargr
Pack. Without the official and unofficial backing of
these parties, the Udheg would likely have been a
scattered entity of marginal importance, rather than
the major headache to the Regency and other Spinward
States that it is. The name is rather generic, meaning
"community support", and applies to political parties,
non-profit and charitable organisations, intellectual
and professional societies and any other organisation
that aids, enriches or structures refugee Vargr
communties.
<P>
<B>Gvaekuers:</B> Former Kforuz splinter group. Gvaekuers was
in service to the Dzarrgh Federate when the Collapse
came, and wisely chose to abandon their employers for
the Regency. The group has no fixed baseworld,
preferring to scatter themselves over several worlds
in Antra and Namidshur subsectors.  Of all the Pack
groups, this is one of the most contentious.  Its
members show no respect for the Frontier boundaries or
the authority of the RQS in enforcing the Quarantine,
and its ships attempt to run the Quarantine
constantly.
<P>
<B>Kaenguerradz:</B> Core supremacist litugy of the Church of
the Chosen Ones.  Interpretation of its commandments
vary widely between Church factions, as is the exact
nature of Vargr "supremacy." Most modern
interpretations now accept as faith the views and
convictions of other sophont species, and limits the
church's mission to diplomatic contact with these
groups. At the other extreme some radical groups have
returned to its original pure racist doctrine, but
thes groups are mostly confined to the Vargr Wilds,
namely surviving corsair bands.
<P>
<B>Kforuzeng:</B> Notorious Vargr corsair alliance native to
Gvurrdon and Tuglikki sectors. The Kforuz have been so
successful and influential a group that its name has
become the official term for "corsair" in Gvurrdon and
some other areas of the Vargr Splinters. The early
history of the Kforuz is rather murky, but the Fourth
Frontier War is generally accepted as being the
beginning of their ascendancy.  At one time before the
Fifth Frontier War a number of Vargr states in
Gvurrdon and Tuglikki were forced to pay tribute to
the group to prevent its raids, and several regions of
the Extents were "no-go" for Imperial traders and
travellers because of the threat of piracy and kidnap.
<P>

The Fifth Frontier War nearly destroyed the group, and
it slowly faded towards obscurity until the 1110s. The
Oekhsos tirades revitalised its membership and
recruitment, and during the Imperial Civil War it
invaded and conquered several worlds in Aramis
Subsector, where it remains in power through proxies.
The group was a major contributor to the formation of
the Vargr Pack, but has been overshadowed and
sidestepped by the shadowy Udhegvol. It has also lost
its Fuernuzorg spec ops unit to the Pack. But it
remains a power to be reckoned with in Gvurrdon, and
has announced its intent to begin reclaiming Tuglikki
for itself.
<P>
<B>Khounerr:</B> Lowest rank of Udheg. Generally a street
soldier or operative in either illegal or legitimate
aspects of the Udheg.
<P>
<B>Ksonotso:</B> Middle and upper class refugees from the
People of Wanz. Also refers to prosperous business
class of Vargr on Urnas/Pretoria that emerged from
these refugees.  The Ksontso immigrated into the
Regency in the early 1140s, though some came in
earlier waves mindful of the threat of Virus.  Most
ended up in Lamas Subsector, and might have stayed
there if not for the efforts of the Duke of Pretoria,
Juganar Kamashidi. The young Duke was spearheading the
redevelopment of Urnas, and saw a complimentary need
between these refugees, and the fledgling industries
on this bitterly divided world. With his aid, the
Ksonotso immigrated to Urnas, and many took up a
position as a "middlebeing minority" filling in
between the emerging transnational managment class on
the world and the highly combative city-states and
their populations.
<P>
<B>Logasllu:</B> Refugees from the Empire of Varroeth, found
in Usani and Namidshur subsectors. Most Vargr found on
Deneb itself are of this group. The Empire of Varroeth
was known for its unusual (for Vargr, anyway) degree
of continuity, and this same tradition has followed
the refugees into their new homeland. Of all the
refugee groups present in the Regency, these are the
most resistant to the influence of the Pack. The
Logasllu have an affinity for order, and were quick to
adapt to Regency corporate and religious structures.
Logasllu cuisine and some traditions has been embraced
in trailing parts of the Stronghold, and they are
renowned as artists and intellectuals.
<P>
<B>Ngaethaeghz:</B> Overall boss for a Goenghoedz.
<P>
<B>Ngorsraek:</B> Surviving splinter group of the Assemblage
of 1116. Survived the Battle of Ashes and took control
of Khoengirrgh/Lamas. The group has long been a source
of opposition to the Regency government, and has
always made clear its desire to restore the
Assemblage.
<P>
<B>Rrouring:</B> Corsair band in command of Rrouring/Lamas.
This world, formerly known as Haniiwa, is the
homeworld of a native minor non-human species known as
the Vixmaa, and the Regency has maintained a large
contingent of MoI Wilderness Rangers and RISS Security
Service personnel to protect the Vargr from this
aggressive species.
<P>
<B>Sourrirrakhs:</B> Corsair band/political party centered in
coreward Aramis/Spinward Marches, and the worlds of
Marz and Carthage (Deneb 0201 and 0202). The group has
become a major rival of Kforuzeng ambitions, and has
plans for reexpanding into Tuglikki just as soon as
the coreward frontier is lifted.  Regency intelligence
has identified a number of forward bases maintained by
the group on several worlds in Gvurrdon. And evidence
is emerging that it has become the chief power in the
remnant of the Thoengling Empire.
<P>
<B>Udheg:</B> Vargr name for the Pack.
<P>
<B>Udhegvol:</B> The legendary leader of the Pack.
<P>
<B>Watchmen:</B>  "Vigilante" terrorist organisation present
in some areas of the Denebian Rampart. The Watchmen
evolved out of community protection groups that were
too vigilant in their protection. Harassment of
innocent Vargr led to the outlawing of several groups.
The more radical humans and other sophont members of
these groups formed resistance cells that carried out
vandalism and bombings of Vargr businesses and homes.
