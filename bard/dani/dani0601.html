<UL><B>Background:</B>
   <UL>
 Background:
 Born 7/II/1167 on Fija.  Jordan earned a joint 
university degree in Starship Engineering and Economic History before 
taking a job with Transstar Corp.  While he was initially attracted to 
the company because of its high profile space vessels, he slowly realized 
that the chances of ever getting space duty were small.  Jordan worked 
first preparing surveys of Fija's industrial capabilities in areas that 
would be important to interstellar trade when that day finally came.  But 
with the realization that Fija would not be going back to the stars 
anytime soon, he moved into Transstars more immediately relevant 
planet-bound transportation and trading businesses.  <p>

     The coming of the Hivers and the reawakening of interstellar trade 
was a welcome surprise and Jordan began looking for a way to get ship 
duty.  His chance came in 1196 when a Free Trader stopped over on Fija 
and one of their officers announced he would stay on Fija with a local 
woman.  Already desperately short-handed they gladly accepted Jordan's 
offer to leave Transstar and join their crew.  On Aurora he managed to 
confuse the local Transstar office into paying for the ship's first 
complete overhaul since the Collapse and slipping away before the truth 
caught up with them.<p>

     He spent the next four years as the ship's purser and the engineer's 
assistant, trading throughout Khulam subsector.  During this time his 
experience evaluating industrial infrastructure showed him the enormous 
possibilities for development in the Wilds.  He became convinced that 
with the right expertise and leadership many worlds could make a recovery 
in decades rather than centuries.<p>

    Jordan maintained occasional contact with Transstar and the Dawn 
League on Fijan trading stops.  When he heard rumors of the Apollo's 
imprisonment on Montezuma, he brought them to the attention of the 
Reformation Coalition authorities on Fija.  Because of his experience 
trading on Montezuma, he volunteered to take a team of intellegence 
operatives back to Montezuma to discover the ship's fate.  Things turned 
violent on Montezuma and Jordan had to be extracted by his Free Trader 
shipmates, but the information gathered by the operatives he helped 
infiltrate onto the planet proved crucial in the success of Ashtabula's 
rescue mission.<p>

    After the raid, Jordan returned to Coalition space.  He went to
Transstar with a proposal for the company to aggressively take advantage
of the trade and development opportunities in the Wilds.  Impressed with
his initiative and passion for the idea the board of directors agreed to
form the Office of Business Development and named Jordan its Executive
Director.  In the year and a half since then, the OBD has initiated a
forward base to supply relic prospectors on Buhle, several Warm
Recoveries, and Trade and Industrial Development Initiatives (TIDIs) on
Vezina and Lancer. <p>


	He's not terribly political and his ideas don't fit neatly into
one camp or another.  In some ways this helps him because he can find
something to agree with on both sides, which helps him gather support for
his projects.  O'Brien agrees with the Centrists that the RCs plans for
absorbing Diaspora sector are totally overblown.  He recognizes that it
will take decades to economically integrate the AO into the RCs nascent
interstellar civillization, and thinks that spreading the RCs few
resources throughout Diaspora is like pissing on a forest fire.  That
said, he supports Federalist efforts to recover relic technology wherever
it my lie, establish new long-range trade ties, and give what aid and
comfort the RC can to the people of the Wilds so they can begin their own
recovery.  As for the strong vs. weak central gov't argument, he thinks 
that both sides miss the point, it's economic, not political, integration 
that will really make the difference.  Politics needs to support that 
goal but be flexible enough to accomodate new trade partners.  
<p>
	His own politics might be the first that have to become more
flexible after the discovery of the Covenant of Suffren.  Before this
event, he would be leaning toward the Centrists since he doesn't see any
opportunities for economical trade over the great distances that the
Federalists want to expand, but once Suffren and its anti-Virus technology
is uncovered he will become very excited about long-range trading missions
and will try to convince any influential people he encounters about the
need for a mission to Alpha Crucis.

<UL><B>Appearance:</B>
   <UL>
  O'Brien's unusually tall and gangly frame is topped by a 
head of close-cropped red hair.  While in Coalition space, O'Brien 
scrupulously maintains himself in appropriate professional attire, but in 
the field he can often be found in standard Transstar ship's crew coveralls.

</UL>

<UL><B>Personality:</B> 
 <UL> O'Brien's overwhelming passion is the re-integration of 
near RC space into an interstellar economy.  He firmly believes that a 
thriving interstellar economy will reduce the xenophobia and technophobia 
of the Wilds inhabitants; create a prosperous middle-class on worlds in 
the AO that will replace oppressive regimes from within; provide the 
foundation for future political integration into the RC; harness the 
output of more worlds to the cause of the RC; and improve the material 
well-being of everyone involved.  The strength of his convictions and his 
intellectual committment to them sometimes blots out his otherwise 
considerable charm.  O'Brien genuinely likes people, which is why he 
thinks what he can do to help them is so important.  When he does turn 
his attention to the people around him he can be a delightful companion, 
a persuasive speaker, and an attentive listener.  The combination of 
these traits sometimes leads to rather abrupt changes in behavior as he 
switches from his driven, detail-oriented persona to a highly gregarious 
and engaging manner.  His enthusiasm and desire to give people the 
benefit of the doubt may make him seem naive at times, but he believes 
this is better than becoming jaded.

   <I>Heart 9:</I>
Jordan is a friendly, agreeable person who enjoys the 
company of people.  He is generous with his subordinates and business 
partners, but the bulk of his energy is devoted to a more diffuse sense 
of serving society in general. <p>

   </UL>
   <UL><I>Club 4:</I>
  While he is convinced of the idea that peaceful trade is 
the best course, as a veteran of more than one firefight in his years as 
a trader and brief experience as an RC intelligence operative, he 
recognizes the need to be prepared for people who are not as peace-loving 
as he is.  He finds these people incredibly frustrating, but is 
determined not to be intimidated. He finds the term "zipper" highly offensive 
in general but, as a measure of his disgust, will use it to refer to 
people he perceives to be needlessly violent, whether TED thugs or RC 
personel.<p>

<UL><B>Refereeing:</B>
   <UL>

 As a director of an organization devoted to trade an 
economic development, O'Brien offers the opportunity for players to take a 
break from saving the world at gun-point.  O'Brien may contact the players 
to conduct all manner of operations related to the activities of the 
OBD.  If they own a ship, they could be asked to be a part of a contact 
mission for a new TIDI; establish a supply post for relic prospectors on 
a boneyard world; carry-out a warm recovery; or perform a long-range 
exploratory trade mission into Alpha Crucis sector.  If they do not own a 
ship, they could still become involved with OBD by being hired to 
investigate sabotage of a TIDI operation or the disapperance of personnel 
from a prospector supply station; provide security to a warm recovery 
operation; or perform a mission to help defend a state friendly with 
Transstar that is being threatened by its neighbors.<p>

     O'Brien and the OBD are a valuable way to provide a different 
perspective to players.  After a series of combat oriented scenarios in 
the Wilds, they might undertake a warm recovery for Transstar.  Imagine 
how their perspective on the RC's methods might change if, after 
negotiating a profitable warm recovery exchange, the deal falls apart 
when RCES or the Oriflammen Marines conduct a SAG raid on a neighboring 
community and the locals turn hostile.<p>

<UL><B>Possessions:</B> 
<UL>

  O'Brien has access to the resources of the Transstar Corp., 
and can arrange transport anywhere on a Transstar route.  In extremis, he 
could also get a ship to take him and a group of players anywhere in the 
AO.  He also controls a variety of mid- to low-tech industrial equipment 
and a small staff of engineers, technicians, and security personnel.  
When in the field O'Brien generally appears in standard Transstar ship's 
crew coveralls, but if he is expecting trouble he will revert to his Free 
Trader habits of wearing a ballistic weave bodysuit under his coveralls 
and an assault shotgun over his shoulder.<p>

	<i>All civilizations are based on mutually beneficial trade.</i><p>
	<i>Get some food in their stomachs and some medicine for their kids 
and they'll forget all about that xeno-techo-whatchamaphobia.</i><p>
	<i>Violence doesn't do anybody any good, but if that's all they 
understand, lets toast those zips.</i><p>
	<i>Everybody comes out ahead on this deal.  It's a win-win.</i><p>
