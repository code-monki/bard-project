<UL><B>History:</B>
<UL>    Dale grew up on Schall. His family was part of a joint fishing venture
between the Schalli and humans.  Dale grew up with a deep respect and 
admiration for the Schalli.  He joined the Schalli Navy and was 
trained in special operations, with a speciality of long range scoutiing.
After Schall joined the Dawn League in 1198, he was part of a exchange
of personal between the Aubani Navy and the Schalli Navy.  <BR><BR>

He served there for two years, when the Dawn League was reformed into
the Reformation Coalition, he applied for and recieved a billet in the
newly formed RCES.  He gathered useful intelligence on several worlds in 
the Wilds, including Nova Rhyll and Xexor.<BR><BR>

    When Assemblyman MacBaen was creating his private recovery team, he
thought it would be useful to have a connection with the RCES, nothing
official, but a backdoors mean of communication.  With this in mind he
hired Dale Green to be the navigator of the <I>Argo</I>.<BR><BR></UL>

<B>Personality:</B>
<UL>Dale defines the word enthusiasm.  He is almost always upbeat and 
gung-ho.  He loves what he is doing, exploring and trying to help people
out. Dale always tries to look on the brighter side of things.<BR><BR></UL>

<B>Quotes:</B>
<UL>"Righty Oh"<BR>
"I already did that, sir."<BR>
"Neato!"<BR>
