<UL><B>Occupation:</B>
     <!A HREF="../opal/opal####.html">Oriflamme 
     <!A HREF="dani####.html">Assemblyman</A> - Leader of the 
     <!A HREF="dani####.html">Antisubinfeudationists</A></UL>
<UL><B>Attributes:</B> <TT>766998-B</TT></UL>
<UL><B>Background:</B>
   <UL>Vareese was born on 
     <!A HREF="../opal/opal####.html">Oriflamme</A> on 06/IX/1160. 
     He attended the 
     <!A HREF="../jess/jess####.html">Nemyer Refounded University (NRU)</A>
     right out of secondary school, focusing on administrative 
     skills. He then attended law school but didn't take the bar, 
     hoping instead to secure a lucrative spot in a corporation. 
     Vareese managed to land a position with 
     <!A HREF="../icis/icis####.html">Waldmann Trust</A>, but 
     proved to be a poor money maker. He became quickly 
     disillusioned with the boring life that his job in the feudal 
     structure provided him, and decided to move on to the 
     <!A HREF="dani####.html">Technarch Council</A>, using family 
     influence. He proved to be a charismatic leader and rose 
     quickly in the 
     <!A HREF="dani####.html">Technarch Council</A>. When the call 
     came out for representatives to the new 
     <!A HREF="../hana/hana####.html">Dawn League</A>, he saw this 
     as a way to further his career and serve the cause of 
     promoting his form of government in the new interstellar 
     government. He was easily appointed and stayed on through 
     the change to the 
     <!A HREF="../hana/hana####.html">Reformation Coalition</A>. 
     Since then, he has viewed what he calls a "softening" of 
     some of the F-tech representatives in the 
     <!A HREF="dani####.html">Assembly</A>, and believes they 
      no longer seek what is best for the 
     <!A HREF="../hana/hana####.html">RC</A>, which is technology 
     controlled by those of proper position and nobility. 
     Recently, he has come to head the small, but vocal minority of 
     <!A HREF="dani####.html">Assemblymen</A> who feel that feudal 
     holdings should not be divided up ever amongst employees and 
     that the technarch-class must be preserved at all costs.</UL>

<UL><B>Appearance:</B>
   <UL>Vareese Kerby is a man of fairly average build and height. 
     He is ever so slightly out of shape, do more to age than 
     lack of activity. He has black hair and brown eyes, which 
     are set somewhat close together, and his nose is thin and 
     not very pronounced. Vareese has a mild overbite, but this 
     doesn't show unless observed very closely. His speech tends 
     to be a little on the quiet side. His demeanor is a little 
     stiff and one does not feel immediately at ease around him. 
     He walks with an air of superiority, bred into him as a 
     member of a strong technarch family.</UL>
</UL>
<UL><B>Personality:</B>
   <UL>Vareese is typical of 
     <!A HREF="../opal/opal####.html">Oriflammen</A> upper class 
     in that he's very self-assured and confident of his own 
     superiority. His attitude is a bit uppity, but not so much 
     as to be overbearing. He is friendly and polite when the 
     situation is called for but can be cold and not very 
     attentive if his mind is on something else. Vareese shows a 
     certain discomfort when forced to deal with those he 
     considers beneath him, specifically, economically or 
     socially beneath him. Amongst his peers, he can be quite 
     animated and cheerful, though and can hold a conversation on 
     just about any topic. On matters that concern him, he is 
     dedicated and thoughtful. In these situations, he gives 
     those involved his undivided attention and will do all in 
     his power to see that a solution is found to their problem. 
     Outside of those things important to him, he is not very 
     responsive, however.</UL>
</UL>
<UL><B>Motivation:</B>
   <UL><I>Spade Jack:</I> Vareese is a pompous, arrogant soul who 
     is firmly convinced of his and his class' superiority to all 
     those around him. He makes no bones about his feelings and 
     is convinced that his beliefs are the way it should be.</UL>
   <UL><I>Heart 6:</I> This is moderated by his strong sense of 
     duty to the 
     <!A HREF="dani####.html">Assembly</A>. He genuinely wants to see the 
     <!A HREF="../hana/hana####.html">Coalition</A> succeed and in 
     his own way respects all its members, even though most do 
     not agree with his "Natural Order". He realizes that not all 
     <!A HREF="dani####.html">Assemblymen</A> are of his stature, 
     but he knows they're the best the member planets have to 
     offer, and for the time being, that will have to be good 
     enough.</UL>
</UL>
<UL><B>Refereeing Kerby:</B>
   <UL>Vareese Kerby is, on the surface, quite simple. He is a 
     natural aristocrat, seeking to preserve the priviledge and 
     power that come with his position. The true depth of his 
     personality, however, lies in his dedication to making the 
     dream of the 
     <!A HREF="../hana/hana####.html">Coalition</A> succeed. Kerby 
     is as dedicated as the most hot-blooded 
     <!A HREF="dani####.html">Federalists</A> to preserving and 
     protecting the 
     <!A HREF="../hana/hana####.htm>RC</A>; he just has a 
     different view of how the 
     <!A HREF="../hana/hana####.htm>RC</A> should be protected. 
     To him, the 
     <!A HREF="../hana/hana####.htm>RC</A> can only survive by 
     concentrating the technological power it has into as few 
     capable hands as possible. To squander such wonders on 
     commoners and foreign governments is folly, when they can be 
     put to such good use at home by those who, by birthright, 
     are capable of best utilizing them. His relation to other 
     <!A HREF="dani####.html">Assemblymen</A>, as stated before, 
     is that he considers them equals, just that some are more 
     equal than others. He makes it his business to get in the 
     way of legislation that would put the 
     <!A HREF="dani####.html">Technarchs</A> at even the slightest 
     risk and/or give more freedoms to common citizens regarding 
     technology or feudal holdings. His inability to reach beyond 
     this, however, has led to his lack of total support even 
     among his fellow 
     <!A HREF="dani####.html">Oriflammen delegates</A>. He has 
     gathered around him, though, the few that agree with his 
     logic and allies himself with people like 
     <A HREF="dani0001.html">Jonas Bigalow</A> when he finds 
     pieces of common ground he can cling to. 
     <A HREF="dani0001.html">Jonas</A> finds it useful to offer a 
     simple appeasement to Vareese in the form of some minor 
     concession or some tacit agreement with his policies in 
     order to win a few extra votes here and there. Those that 
     do not agree with Kerby's position find it difficult to 
     tolerate him for extended periods, as his true personality 
     tends to wear through after prolonged exposure.</UL>
