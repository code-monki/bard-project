<UL><B>History:</B>
   <UL> Archon Song was given to the Purple Wind Monastery by his parents. 
The Monastery raised him, and upon turning 18 he joined the temple guard.  
Here he served with distinction for 16 years.  Late in 1201, he got into a 
fight with a fellow guard, over a bottle of whiskey, the argument turned 
physical, and Archon ended up killing the guard.  The monks, sentenced 
Archon to exile, he would never be able to return to Spires.  He regrets his 
action, and accepts his punishment, he has taken a vow to never 
kill another human being.  He has taken it upon himself to wander the Galaxy,
spreading the word of the Purple Wind Monastery, maybe one day he will
settle down and form a new monastery, but for now he wanders and always 
preaches the evils of violence.</UL>
