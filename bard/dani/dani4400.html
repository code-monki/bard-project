<UL><B>Background:</B>
   <UL>
   Erik was born on Rethe in the Spinward Marches, though he now lives on Whanga/Regina/Spinward Marches.
   He always hungered to `make it big', and get out of his cronically depressed megalopolis. Dimling
   started out as a small-time organ dealer, arranging the illegal sale of blood and kidneys. Eventually
   took over the business: developed and extended "Organ harvesting" to target the ill, street people
   and especially untended children (who's organs go for the highest prices on the black market)
   <P>
   After branching into less-than-reputable hospitals, he's now believed to operate a "medical testing
   centre" - with sentients as testing subjects - somewhere in Uthe/Gvurrdon: the subsector
   governor's Justice Commission  suspect's Orsesokh/Uthe/Gvurrdon (A000874-F),
   the capital of the coreward Thonengling Raghz
   ("Thoengling Empire" in the local Vargr dialect)
   <P>

   Currently, Mr. Dimling is attempting to recify his only noticable failure: his every attempt to take over
   Whanga for his own purposes has been repeatedly countered by the local democartically-elected
   Resident (the local nobility he has in his pocket). He came close to staging a favourable coup, but
   something went wrong, and he had to back off or face the wrath of the Regent himself. The Regent just
   happens to be subsector Duke, and is not pleased with how Dimling corrupted the local Nobility.
