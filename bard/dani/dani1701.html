<UL><B>Occupation:</B> Captain of the <I>Shinai</I> </UL>

<UL><B>Attributes:</B> 5A6C89-2<TT> </TT></UL>
<UL><B>Background:</B>
   <UL>
   Jamie was born on Gus/Shumisdi/Diaspora a small pastorial planet, where nothing much happens and she lived in the town of Bridgeford, a small farming town, where even less happens.  While she figured out what to do with her life, Jamie went to work for her parents on the family farm.  When she was 22 a starship landed near town and the crew came into town to trade for food and machine tools.  They weren't used to trading, but the nearby Planetary Defense Forces  base kept them from causing any trouble.  Gus might be a small planet, but it was armed to the teeth.
<P>
   Jamie had never been exposed to outworlders and she was quite taken with them.  She neglected her farm work and took to hanging around the crew, in particular Dideo Boggins, the astrogator.  When it came time for the ship to leave, she begged Dideo to take her with him.  He too had grown close, and he managed to convince the captain of the ship to take on Jamie as the steward.  Jamie thought this sounded wonderful, but she later came to realize that this meant she was the cook and washwoman.  She also learned that the ship wasn't a simple trader, but a freebooter, ravaging the subsector.  Taking what they needed and living a life of freedom.  Rather than being traumitized by this discovery, she thought it was quite romantic.
<P>
   After a few months, she the had lost some of that romanticism, but she still loved the life.  She wasn't willing to be the cook forever and eventually started tagging along on raids and learning the basics of ship's operations.  To the suprise of the entire crew, she was very good at this and quickly surpassed many of the crew members.  She had a natural knack for tactical situations and was also a crack shot.
<P>
   In 1191, Dideo died while on a raid against a settlment.  Jamie was upset about this, but she figured they had some good times and eventually everyone's number comes up.  In 1193, the <I>Shinai</I> captured a small free trader,  it was
   carrying a diplomat from Sase/Sulieman/Solomani Rim.  The Captain insisted that the diplomat knew about secret cache of technology that the ship had been hearing rumors of and started to torture the diplomat.  Several of the crew protested, but the Captain proceeded anyway.  Jamie called a meeting of the crew and had a vote if they should remove the captain from office. The vote went 8-3 against the captain.    The crew then put the captain down on Vanefa/Sulieman/Solomani Rim.  The crew then elected Jamie captain.  That wasn't her motivation, but she was willing to accept the crew's decision.  Since then she has led the crew to many succesful raids and missions.
   <P>
   For use in a Regency campaign, subsititute Zinadurra/Strand/Corridor for Gus.  For use in another sector of space, find a planet with a low population and a low law level.

<UL><B>Appearance:</B>
   <UL> Jamie has curly black hair, which she puts up a variety of different hair styles depending on her mood.  She has taken to wearing typical pirate clothes, such as bandanas on her head, knee high black boots, white shirts with puffy sleeves, funny hats, big hoop earrings, waistcoats etc.  She hasn't been able to find a parrot, but she is still looking.  She is fairly short 1.6m = 5'2", and only weighs 45kg = 100lbs. She almost always has a smile on her face.</UL>
</UL>
<UL><B>Personality:</B>
   <UL> Jamie has a very romantic view of the world.  She loves the life of a swashbuckling rogue.  She is willing to kill to accomplish her goals, but only combatants.  She won't stand for her crew to kill innocents.  Killing people isn't good business, if her crew goes around killing innocents, it provides less incentive for people to surrender.  It is alot easier to make money if the victim just gives up their goods when the ship shows up.  Fighting causes casualties which are hard to replace, and has the possibility to damage the goods.  Jamie and her crew are willing to fight if neccesary, it's just easier on everyone if they don't have to.
   <P>
   Jamie has a very positive outlook on life, she is always ready with a joke.  She is a friendly and outgoing person.  She has a personal relationship with each of her crewmembers.  She knows they aren't perfect, but they are all her friends.  She won't stand for any of them to be abused.</UL>
