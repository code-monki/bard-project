"One of the things you last expect to see when meeting a Religious 
person is a display of arms. I was sitting in the office of Father 
Konstantin Bognarski, founder and administrator of the Star Trust 
Foundation. Right behind his chair, hanging on the wall was an old 
Imperial Gauss Pistol. The Father, a slim man just seemed to be hitting
that time in life where fat begins to win the battle over muscle smiled.
He told me that the gun was a momento of one of the many interesting 
aspects of his life, but that he'd only tell me about it after he'd
explained the task the Foundation was setting itself - and the whole 
of the Coalition. He began by filling a glass with filthy water, and 
launched into a sermon on how this was the standard endured by most 
of Charted Space. I knew I should have been bored with this spiel, 
but he had me entranced. When he'd finished his case he had to prompt
me to ask my searching questions, he'd had me under his spell so deeply."
<p>
Excerpt from <i>Guiding Stars - Leading Lights of the Coalition</i> by 
Jellika Barden, Pub 1204, Trika Press, Trybec.

<p>
Father Konstantin Bognarski is the founder and administrator of the 
'Star Trust Foundation', a charitable organisation based on Trybec. 
The Trust distributes high-tech educational tools, and survival 
devices to worlds devastated by the collapse.
<p>
The Father started life in Maikko, Oriflamme, the son of an Independent
Mechanic who owned a repair shop. As was common for a shop owner's son, 
he spent a lot of his time preparing to take over the business, and thus 
his education was tailored to the practical side of things. He gained a 
competence in Computers, Electronics and Mechanics, and also learned to 
be an adroit salesman. At age 16, his life collapsed around him. A local 
technarch, who was troubled by the competition posed by his father bought 
the ground rights to his shop off the town council. His first act was to 
increase the rent a hundredfold. When his father defaulted on this he 
sent armed retainers around to confiscate the property. There was an 
altercation, and in the confusion his father was shot dead. Konstantin 
had locked himself in the garage, and when the retainers tried to force 
their way in, broke out in the Family's Recovery Vehicle - knocking down 
and killing one of the retainers in the process. In a split second he'd 
changed from a teenager to a fugitive.
<p>
The next Three years were spent on the run. He moved to Brensrelm one of 
the larger cities, ran with street gangs, and quickly rose to bee the 
brains of a small computer fraud operation operated by a local crime 
syndicate. Then the technarch who'd caused the grief in the first place 
rose to head a large industrial concern. He'd been enraged that a 'little
thug' had been able to kill one of his retainers and get away with it, and
he used his increased power to stir up a planet-wide search for
Konstantin. To escape this increased spotlight he used his contacts to
forge himself a passcard. As Cowley Smiths he signed on as a spacehand on
the Free Trader <i>Batavian Dream</i>, a Far Trader out of Mueller.
<p>
He immersed himself fully in the Trader culture, and quickly established 
himself as a competent engineer's mate. In 1181 his crew ran afoul of the 
Authorities on Martham. The Processing Plant finally sealed up, and the 
Starport wouldn't help repair it unless the ship serviced the slaver 
operations based there. Using the skills he learnt whilst on the run on
Oriflamme, Konstantin and the Crew managed to 'liberate' the components 
they needed. His expert covering up operation left the authorities unaware
of the theft. His handling of this matter, and his general competence led
to his commission as the ship's Fourth Officer. This was a much more
wide-ranging job, and Konstantin found himself handling transactions,
supervising cockpit operations, in addition to helping engineering keep
the ship in space. In the first year a an officer, the Captain died in a
bar brawl on Xezor, and his First Officer took command. She was a far more
cynical person, with a cruel streak that cowed most of the crew.
Konstantin found himself involved in more shady dealings, most involving
the Guild. The last straw came whenever the Captain started dealing in
slaves, in thelucrative Martham market. On confronting the Captain about
this, he found himself placed in the Hold with the Slaves, the latest
acquisition. After a year of hard, but sedentary technical work on
Martham, he managed to escape from his Master, and was given refuge by a
sympathetic Trybeci Ship Master. It was on the long fight to the port that
he acquire the old Imperial gauss pistol that he keeps as a momento. He
worked his passage to Trybec, and decided to stay there. The reasons for
this were many, he was tired of travelling, he also had gotten religion in
his darkest hours. Maybe he could build something on Trybec which could
help those poor souls he had inadvertently harmed whilst a Crew Member on
the <i>Batavian Dream</i>.
<p>
In the 'Church of Aspects' he found a home. It taught that all mystic
events of the past, Jesus, Buddha, Terguman - all were aspects of God that
shone on the Material Universe. Originating on Bellerophon, in the
Solomani Rim, during the Long Night it spread wide during the rise of the
Third Imperium, being an all-embracing religion. It has a rather odd
attitude to aliens though, as God's aspects to Aliens were individually
tailored to their strange mindsets, they should not be interpreted by
Humans. The religion doesn't accept non-human members. Instead it helps
aliens set up their own 'aspect' of the church. A prophesy from the depths
of the Long Night foretells a time when God will send the greatest aspect
of himself into the Universe and guide all intelligent life to a total
understanding of each other. Then the Church will be one.
<p>
Konstantin enrolled in the small seminary in Hilshade, a small town near 
the Downport. After 3 years of study and charitable work he was confirmed
as a Priest, and elected to pastor to the Travellers and inhabitants of 
the Port. In this he was very successful, mainly because he spent more
time helping people than holding services. Whilst this was looked down
upon by the Elder Priests of the Church, it's structure was so loose that
all the could do was express their dissatisfaction. He began gathering Lay
Helpers, some of whom were ship personnel, who could spread the good work
far and wide. One day he met up with an old Free Trader acquaintance of
his, and they spent the night drinking and reminiscing about old time. He
was troubled the next day, by both a sore head - and the fact that on
almost all of the worlds they had discussed the life of the inhabitants
had gotten grimmer. The League of the New Dawn had just been organised,
and whilst it's aims were good, it concentrated on building the economies
of it's members. He resolved to build an organisation that would do what
it could to bring immediate relief to the poor souls of the Wilds.
<p>
His will was made reality in The Star Trust Foundation. It's charter was
to help the people of the Wilds regain a bit of the safety and rights of 
civilisation. Konstantin deliberately made it a realistic organisation. 
"There's no profit in getting yourself killed helping people when you can 
bug out and help them again" As he wrote in it's constitution. "And
there's no use exhausting your civilisation to help another - you won't be
around when they need you again" He continued. By setting the Foundation
firmly in reality he gained the eventual support of Trybecorp, and they
provided him with the tools he needed to help his flock in the Wilds. The
main tools were survival items like water purifiers, solar stills,
antibiotics and medical instruments. The most unusual was 'The Oracle'. A
TL-10 computer database, armoured to resist all but the most violent of
attacks, it contained an educational program based upon the needs of a
fallen world. Agronomy, Mining, Medicine, Recovery of Relic Items..and
much more. With this Konstantin hoped to help the 'wilders' help
themselves. As he was about to organise his first expedition into the
wilds, the wilds entered the League. Vezina was liberated from an
oppressive TED by a League rescue force. Working at breakneck speed
he prepared to tackle this new challenge. In a month the oracles and
survival goods were ready, and he set off with a small team to bring
civilisation to Vezina. He returned in two months, after achieving his
mission, though it was not without it's hairy moments. Bringing back
infofeed of primitive settlements beginning the long walk to civilisation
brought in new offers of aid, and much more volunteers. More importantly,
it won over a good deal of the Free Trader community, and now his friends
there would not only fill him in on planetary situations, they'd also
deliver his aid.
<p>
After this success he organised aid deliveries to Phoebus and Spires
within the RC, and Atrase and Nicosia - though the Free Trader delivering
the supplies to the latter barely lifted in time. This caused a bit of a
halt to the programme for a while, though friendly Trader still took
packages to worlds on their routes. With the RC now aggressively expanding
into the wilds, the Father decided to follow behind them. After the RC
contacted the low populations worlds along the Montezuma-Darianne main, he
arranged for aid to be delivered to them. The Oriflammen
invasion of Spenser was also followed by a large aid drop. He is currently
expanding direct operations to Thoezzent and Shenk - but is worried about
the increasing Vampire threat to operations throughout space. He has had
to suspend many operations in Khulam because of this, and this has
impacted on plans to expand to Promise. The Father has been left a beat-up
Liner in a will. This is in the final stages of being converted to an aid
ship in the Trybeci Highport. With this ship he hopes to be able to
contact worlds with hostile governments and in hostile 
areas - as it will be well armed for it's size. It has been named 'Divine
Succour'. This ship will also perform a new function, collecting 'alms'.
In order to fund the expansion of the Foundation, the Father plans to ask
those helped by the organisation to donate relic items. There will be no
force behind the request, and those unable to provide equipment will be
treated the same as those who can. 
<p>
His other major plan is to set up the first of many 'Bootstrap' Colleges.
Here worthy strudents from the wilds can come and be educated to the high
standards of the Coalition. When they return to the Homeworlds they will
be ideally equipped to raist them into the Starfaring Community. This plan
can't be implimented unless the Divine Succor is successful in it's
mission. If a ship as well defended as it can't get to the worlds where
the prospective student will be recruited from, they can't attend the
College.
<p>
Current major operations are ongoing on Spires, Meadsk, and at a Bootstrap
site on Nicosia. The Father is interested in learning more about
conditions in Alpha Leonis, as information on this Sector is sparse.
<p>
The Foundation's Headquarters are in the SkyDagger Tower, an old-time Grav
reinforced building near the Trybec Downport. The Grav systems failed
during the collapse, and the slim upper section of the tower fell,
devastating a lot of the commercial area around the port. The Stubby
conical base survived, and the Foundation's offices are midway up it's 500
Metre height. The Father can be found, more often than not, in the Gardens
built on the flared top, where the juncture between the lower and upper
sections of the building formerly was. The 1.5 km upper reach of the tower
has long since been cut up for scrap, though some of the buildings around
are actually constructed from it's remains.

<UL><B>Appearance:</B>
   <UL>
The Father is about 5'8" tall. He is slim, but not gaunt. He
has brown hair which is losing the two-front war against going white and
going bald. He usually wears a low white four-corner hat, coupled with a
long smock and baggy trousers, of the same colour. On more official
occasions he wears a high two-sided hat, with a smock and trousers,
featuring intricate stitching of a religious matter. The overall effect is
quite Ottoman. His only visible vice is that for sandwiches, which he
picked up as a Free Trader. He drinks, but only socially. He looks as if
he's been aged a few decades more than the four-and-a-half that he's
lived, but his verve and charisma make up for that. Whilst well educated,
mostly by the university of life, he talks simply, though he can be
extremely eloquent if it is needed.<p>

<UL><B>Motivation:</B>
   <UL><I>Heart King:</I>
 Konstantin is a very personably human being. People find it 
easy to relax around him, and tend to be very open in his presence. He 
wishes to do his best for the people in the wilds. This is not to say 
he has no regard for the Citizens of the Coalition, there are a myriad 
of talented people working to further it's aims, so he looks after the
wilds.
 
   </UL>
   <UL><I>Club 9:</I>
The Father is a realist. He despises people who galvanise the 
populace behind short term charitable projects with not thought to the 
future. This is reflected in his own work and made physical in 'his' 
ship the <i>Divine Succour</i> - it is built to survive.

The <i>Divine Succour</i>.

This is the modified liner currently being overhauled at Trybec. it
differs from the standard Bastien class liner in the following ways:
<p>
<LI>The fuel tankage has been cut to make more volume available.

<LI>A good sensor suite has been added, as has a decoy dispenser.

<LI>Weapons include three overpowered laser turrets, a missile turret, and an 
MFD to co-ordinate them. Defences consist of a pair of sand turrets.

<li>There is a machine and electronics shop, as well as 2 laboratories and 
3 sick bays. There is 51 tons of cargo space in the hold. 24 staterooms 
provide for the crew, which includes 4 medics, 8 specialists and 6 troops.
<li>
There are two auxiliary craft. The standard launch, fitted in a minimal 
hangar, and a medical launch, based on a modified ship's boat, in a
docking 
ring.
<p>
While this ship could not afford to act uncautiously in the wilds, its 
uprated weapons and high jump capability makes it the best ship for the 
job in hand.
