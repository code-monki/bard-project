<UL><B>Occupation:</B>
Grand Admiral and Sea Lord of the Regency, Countess of Delrirook, Marchioness of Takahira, Rif ans Kamlar
Baroness of 22 fiefs (15 in Deneb sector, 4 in the Spinward Marches, 3 in Vland Sector)
['Delrirook' is a multisystem fief of 11 systems in Deneb Sector, including Pika]</UL>
<UL><B>Attributes:</B> <TT>548866-E</TT></UL>
<UL><B>Background:</B>
   <UL>

   Countess Murladiikash is the oldest ruling noble alive, outside of Low Berth. While not beloved like
Norris or Avery, she is respected for her loyality to the Regency and her vigourous defense of the
democratic reforms.  She was born on Pika/Vast Heavens/Deneb, but now lives on Mora/Mora/Spinward Marches.
<P>
Her family line can be traced back to the rulers of a small, seafaring Vilani nation some 150,000 years
ago. She has followed her families expectation in all ways, joining the Imperial Sea Navy and rising to a subsector
Admiral position by the time of the Rebellion. Regency Sea Lord since 1181, the Grand Admiral has
overseen a major and long-overdue upgrade of her forces.
<P>
[ And, in case you're wondering what a Wet Navy Grand Admiral has to do with a navy of 12
different tech levels and over 3700 seperate oceans.... Well, it's mainly oriented to A) maintaining a
universal standard of training and equipment B) logistics [ie. shipping TL F submarines to defend a
TL 7 world from Aslan attack.] C) distribution of resources, with hi-pop water worlds and their
undersea cities getting top priority.
<P>
The Countess has taken special interest in developing submarines fleets that can be dropped in from
orbit. A very select group of jump-capable subs has also been raised, and is currently undergoing
testing. ]
<P>
PC's can be involved as "personal reps" or a "personal xboat service" for the Grand Admiral. Spying
on Aslan fleets, training wet navies, and looking in the Wilds for examples of Virus naval tactics is
also needed./The players should be wary of being used as bait for the last example, though.

</UL>
<UL><B>Appearance:</B>
   <UL> For a pureblood Vilani, Countess Murladiikash is on the short and squat side. Her light-brown skin,
contrasted against grey eyes and short salt-and-pepper hair, thends to leave the impression of
stolid, sensible stability rather than the exotic and alien.
</UL>
</UL>
<UL><B>Personality:</B>
   <UL>The Countess' naturally conservative, 'by-the-book' way of living is exaggerated immensely by the
fact that A) She's a Noble B) She's Vilani C) She's in the least galmourous of the Regency military
services D) her long, long life.
<P>
She's also something of a grouch, endlessly complaining that Things Today would never meet
Gavin's/Strephon's/Norris' standards, and that nothing today matches The Good Ole Days of the
unified Imperium / the Rebellion / the Domain Era.
<P>
Her favourate subject - and the high point of her long life - was when she, as a young duchess on her
war to the Imperial Sea Navy Academy on Capital, was invited to witness Strephon's coronation at
1071. PC's will quickly learn which key words to avoid.

<UL><B>Possessions:</B>
<UL>Excluding stuff at home.
When travelling on offical business, she rates a Light Cruiser (10-40,000 Disp). She owns
a 350-Disp, TL G yacht and a decommissioned, antique TL & aircraft carrier. It's on Giikusu/Dunmag/Deneb.
