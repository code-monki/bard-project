A word on the FTL (Free Trader's League) for Shield & Diaspora campaigns,
this was formally named for something several dozen Free trader Ship
Captains met at their annual Rendevous on Ephraim (grid: 3118/Pasdaruu)
E-789845-7 Ri C:4 210 Wi G8 V M0* D in V/1202...where they met the RCS
Belladonna, who had a week previously rescued one of the "Big Ships" from a
Corsair in the Nantes system(Grid 3219/Pasdaruu).
<P>
    Now a "rendevous" of Free Traders, is sort of like what the Mountain men
of yore used to have--a time to come together, sell their furs, ect, get
resupplied, paid off by the Fur Coy, get drunk, etc, fight & what not. In
this day and age, its a way to keep in touch with ones peers, share news,
conduct trade, & marriages--Free Traders inter marry Ship to ship.
"Hire-ons" have to work X amount of years before they earn the Family name &
the right to marry. There are some Ships that do not adhere to "the
old-ways", and hire on crew--sometimes these turn out to be Guild Hijackers,
and they're never seen again...So Crewing aboard one tends to make one
fairly protective of one's crew/family unit. Fiercely so.
[From data borrowed heavily from Citizen of the Galaxy& Friday--R Heinlein/
Merchanter's Luck/ Union-Earth war series, CJ Cherryh].
<P>
    This being something "New" to the First Contact crew, the Skipper, (PC)
decided to make the best of it, besides making relic-Tech/ Trade transfer offers for a
trade rte to Sufren with the planet's aging/dying leader...and with a
grateful Skipper of the FTS ship "Norway", got an invitation to the annual
Captain's dinner (Where all the boondoggling & horse trading goes on between
ships). <P>
    It was on Ephraim the Guild had sent assassins to, to "remove a
particular fly in their ointment", a man, known as Martin Francis Rourke,
permanent passenger on the all female Sentient-crewed SS TeBiRoCaMon (what was left
of the paint job saying "The Big Rock Candy Mountain"),a Solomani Sundowner-class Far Trader.(Humans, Scanians, Aslan,
& Vargr--from near Sufren (aha!).<P>
    Mr Rourke, an Imperial remnant, former passenger on Arrival Vengeance (Warinir/Daibei to Trin/Deneb), former History
Professor at Warinir, (and former member of IRIS, among other things!) was stirring up trouble for the Guild by persuading the
FT Skippers to organize for their self-defense vs Guild encroachment/extortion/ & piracy of their own. The Guild had placed this
"troublemaker" on their wanted "dead, or Very Dead" list...And their attempt was foiled by a certain 'Donna crewman (PC), a
remnant himself, from JEDDEL's doomtrade, and a happy go lucky fella in the right place at the wrong time. He was nearly cut
in half by a shotgun blast, when Mr Rourke and he departed a certain establishment for games of chance. Mr Rourke and he
shot and killed five assailants(better initiatives), left three wounded for the local police and took off in the TeBiRoCaMon's airraft
back to the Starport. The Pc's life was saved by some hi tech suff in the ship's hold. (an TL-15 autodoc & Med Skill IV), before
he could bleed to death...Rourke patched him up, and had him delivered as a "Package" to the Belladonna late the next day.
 <P>   (The PC used some Psi healing to finish the rest of the work on himself). Mr Rourke brought up the topic of "this brave
young "RC crewperson's "saving his life", at the FT Skipper's Pow-wow & dinner, and invited the RC Skipper to attend, along
with Ms Khuvishaam (NPC envoy/Star Vikings).
    <P>
    The idea had merit, as the Big ten were in port, as well as two dozen smaller ships (Like the Sundowner 200-800 dtns). So
far, they have done as RCES has wished, and relocated their routes closer to Sufren & the RC (and hence Richard me boyo,
Shield!). The FTL Skippers agreed to this "deal" schedules permitting...
<P>

    The FTL was so named, as a reaction to this affront by a Guild sponsored corsair ship which the 'Donna's crew destroyed (a
Gazelle CE), at the loss of 1x armed Mod cutter., the proofs of which were presented to the assmebled Skippers.
     Having a Telepath PC with him, the Skipper PC & the other PC figured out what to tell em..& offered them a safe & secure
polity to trade with, as well as one free Overhaul on their aging ships, in exchange for current UWPdata on the subsectors they
worked in. This would be of vital interest to RCES-Intel Section (headed by Sid  "Papa" Papagoulis/NPC-Star Vikings, Pot/
SAG), whose right hand was the ship's S-2 officer for this trip. They also were introduced to Mr Branu Stigmann, purchasing
weapons for the resistance on promise here--who sorta  Black-sheep amongst them Free Tradin folk! (THink Han Solo, for
Stigmann)

<P>
The Big Ten are:
 <UL>
<LI>1) SS <I>Norway</I> / 1kton  <I>Starhauler</I> J3/1G, the Svenssonn family (Solomani-Scandanavian descendants), approx 54 members
(includes dependents aboard). Captain Ivorr "Truestar" Svenssonn(m). (Route: Shimmer/Massilia to Madoc/Diaspora).
Reputation: Natural astrogators, hard bargainers. Carousing  an on board 0-skill level asset. Brawlers & tall talkers, but never
boastful.
 <P>
<LI>2) SS <I>Dublin Forever</I>/ 4kton, <I>Hercules</I> AH-4 (J3/3G) Express-Freight-liner; the O'Connor family, (Sol-Irish descendants), approx
84 members(includes dependents). CPT Daniel "Iron hands" O'Connor(m). Senior most FTL Skipper alive, the nominal "head"
of the FTL. Politically charismatic, independent, and turned down an "admiral's chair" with the Gegaasha Guild twice. Has no
love for Corsairs or Pirates, or Planetary snoops. His word is law, and his bond. The last of an Ancient breed of honest traders.
 <P>
<LI>3) SS <I>Donegal</I> / 2kton <I>Paschendaele</I> freighter (J3/1G); the O' Neill family(Sol-Irish descendants), , approx 48 members
(includes dependents), CPT Eileen  "Banshee" O Neill (f)
(Rte- Charuth/Sol Rim to Sufren/Diaspora). Reputation:  Skilled dealers & opportunity exploiters. Quick to buy or sell, fight or
make love. A Rowdy bunch in port. Virgins need not apply! Skipper's nickname makes her turn red ( she was overheard during
such an "engagement" in port once, and has yet to live it down!).
 <P>
<LI>4) SS <I>Shanghai</I>/ 2ktn <I>Orrimot</I> Logistics ship(J2/1G); The Liu family,(Sol-Cantonese descendants), 55 members (includes
dependents); CPT Chiang Sung Liu (m). (Rte: Sufren/Diaspora to Alurza/Diaspora) Reputation: Quiet, honest, steady folk.
plying the space lanes. "Measure twice, cut once" is their motto. Seldom talkative, but when they do, folks tend to prick up
their ears.
 <P>
<LI>5) SS <I>Golden Moon</I>/ 6ktn AH-3 <I>Hercules</I> bulk freighter (J2(x2)/1G); the Chin family (Sol-Mandarin descendants), 52 member
(includes dependents), CPT Shangzhi Chin (f).
Rte: Madoc/Diaspora , Charuth(Concord)/Sol Rim to Suleiman/Sol Rim). Much like the crew of the Shanghai, save they tend to
be bolder, more prone to riskier cargoes, like foodstuffs. CPT Chin runs a tight ship, and is a stickler for cleanliness.
 <P>
<LI>6) SS <I>Khishan</I>/ 4ktn Tukera Liner(wilds modified with fuel shuttle & 1x CP 1000dtn pod attached) (J3/1G); the Duushgiggi
family (Vilani refugee descendants from Khishan/Massilia);
CPT Valenciia " Duushgiggi(f), 56 members (includes dependents). (Rte Shimmer/Massilia to Alurza/Diaspora). Reputation:
Traditional values sums it up, from sides of this family. Meals are eaten as a family, and "the old ways are the best ones for a
reason." Shrewd dealers. Tend to second O'connor's lead.
 <P>
<LI>7)  SS <I>Orkney</I>/ 2ktn TI-Frontier Trader (J2/2G); the Campbell family (Sol-Scots descendants), 47 members (includes
dependents). CPT Robert "BlackGuard" Campbell. (Rte:Iusea/Diaspora toShumdisi/Diaspora to Madoc/Diaspora, to
Charuth/Sol Rim). Reputation: Currently on the mend, after a decade of Guild servitude. Mercenary, and run like a military
ship. Robert Campbell is a hard man, and an unforgiving one. why he left the Guild, he has not said, and even wise O'Connor
knows better than to bait him. Takes on Hire-ons.
 <P>
<LI>8) SS <I>Iggarir</I>/3.5kton Tukera Liner (J4/1G),(wilds-modified, SL hull), the Huunyaati family (Sol-Italian-Vilani descendants), 60
members(includes dependents); CPT Antonina Sforza-Huunyaati (f). (Rte: Shiwonee/Massilia to Madoc/Diaspora). Reputation:
Innovative, and yet strangely conservative crewed ship. Several crew are Geonee from SHionwee who "married in", yet there is
no old Vilani-Geonee animosity aboard. Hires only Llyrnians for Ship's troops( Carries 15). Iggarir has scotched six corsairs in
her sixty odd year career, and is lovingly maintained.

 <P>
<LI>9) SS <I>Denmark's</I> Gold / 2kton <I>Fuer</I> class freighter (J3/1G), the Krog family (Sol-Irish/Danish descendants), 44
members(includes dependents). CPT Robert "Treekiller" Krog, Sr.(m). (Rte: Vega/Sol Rim to Madoc/Diaspora). Reputation: A
staunch O'Connor supporter. Seen as a likely replacemnet for him when "Iron-Hands" passes on. Galanglic-Rite Catholics,
they sow their wild oats Mon-Saturday, & confession of Sundays. Friendly towards travelling Missionaries of various
faiths--CPT Krog enjoys debating theology & the foibles of Human-kind. Has seven children himself (5 sons, two daughters).
 <P>

<LI>10) SS <I>Wanderlus</I>t /4(2)ktn <I>Ursala</I> Freight Tractor (J2(4)/1G), the von Schilling family (Sol-German descendants), 42
members(includes dependents), CPT Ursala von Schilling (f).
(Rte:  Varies, zig-zags from Upper Sol-Rim (A-C subsectors to Diaspora's M-P subsectors). Reputation:
Paradoxical--merchant by instinct, work hard & play harder. They tend towards relying on Miracles, and believe they are a
"Lucky" ship. Unlike some of the Conseervatives, CPT Schilling still keeps tabs with the Guild, if only to know whats going on.
Risk takers in the extreme, in every sense of the word. While they may have a Space borne Bacchanalia, that traditionalist
Skippers blush at, they are no shirkers from a fight if attacked, and quite ruthless ina disquieting way. "We don't get even,"
CPT Schilling smiles,"we get ahead!"
<P>

There were two merchanters from Xulfor & Jenms also present, but were planetary owned ships. A larger Aslan merchant ship
(600dtns was inbound when the RCS <I>Belladonna</I> departed.)
</UL> <P>


Things the Big 10 have in common--all are family owned/operated. All are fiercely independent, and follow a chain of
command, whether matriarchal or patriarchal. All of them want to be free to pursue a livelihood without "Guild-dues" & having to
resort to the Dark Trade (slavery/ piracy). CPT Campbell is a former Guilder (or so he says), hence his nickname. The elders
teach the youngers who will replace them someday. The FTL believes in extrality zones--their laws exist on their ships at the
airlock, no matter where they dock. They effectively use this power versus recalcitrant "grounders" & some "Stationers" who
wish to intrude upon them.<P>
    As there are no longer hook ups from ship to station when docked, they feel they can police their own ships & crews. An
Anti-virus inspection is one thing, intruding into their domain(ships) for no good reason (Individual Skippers will define what that
means!). Most have merchanted by the strict rules ofthe Covenant of Sufren & the Geonee Confederation's interstellar policies.
They frequently convoy in pairs, when they can, or with smaller allied ships.
   <P> In the 1180's there were at least 30 large Free Trading family run ships left. Since then, 12x are believed lost to Vampire
ships or TEDs system defense forces. The remaining eight were swayed by the Guild leadership and kept their ships, if not
their reputations with the rest. The names of the "Black eight" (was nine, counting SS Orkney) are left to each GM to figure up.
 <P>
For additional notes on customs, marriages, etc, good reading for this are <I>Citizen of the Galaxy</I> & <I>Friday</I> (Robert Heinlein)/
<I>Chanur/Merchanters/Union series </I> by CJ Cherryh, among others.
