<UL><B>Background:</B>
   <UL>
    Rachelle was born and orphaned in one of the few slums on Luhtala.  As a child she was involved in petty larceny and low level street crime.  When she was 15 she heard a member of the order preaching; she became interested in the message of salvation and soon became a regular attendee of services. When she turned 16 she petitioned to be admitted to the Order so she could spread the word of the Lord and to protect and defend the helpless.  Since then she has become a devout and faithful member of the order.  She has become a great preacher and is responsible for turning many sinners onto the path towards salvation. She has also become an excellent poet. While her poetry contains elements of her her faith, most of it deals with the wonders and beauty of the world.  Even with her preaching she is still an active member of the order and the government has assigned her to work with RCES operatives on several missions in the Wilds. These have gone well and she expects to take part in other operations in the future.  
   <P>
   Rachelle is not a fanatic and does not press her beliefs on those who do not want them. When she preaches, she does so by gently trying to persuade people, rather than telling them they are damned to hell if they do not accept her beliefs.  She does believe that those who do not accept the teachings of the Lord will suffer for it in the afterlife, but she feels that she is a teacher not a demagogue.

<UL><B>Appearance:</B>
   <UL> Rachelle is a fairly average looking woman, with short auburn hair and very dark skin. She has an athletic build and appears to be in excellent physical shape.  She dresses mostly in the casual uniform of the order, but occasionally she will slip into civvies. Regardless of her clothes she always wears a crucifix around her neck.  She tends to keep several knives on her person, regardless of the circumstances. </UL>
</UL>
 
<UL><B>Motivation:</B>
   <UL><I>Queen of Hearts:</I>Rachelle is one of the most gentle and kind hearted people you will ever meet.  She is generally interested in the well being of everyone and will assist anyone in need.  She is quite different from the angry bitter teenager she was when she joined the order. </UL><P>
   <UL><I>8 of Clubs:</I>  It is quite ironic that the kind hearted Rachelle is a trained assassin.  She will only resort to violence when it is necessary to protect the populace that she and all other members of the order are sworn to protect.  When she is forced to kill she does so with sadness, as anyone she kills will not have the opportunity to be saved.  </UL>
</UL>
 
<UL><B>Possessions:</B><UL>
Rachelle has very few possesions. Her clothes are mostly Order issued uniforms though she has a few casual outfits. She has several rifles and knifes, but only enough to do her job.  She has a large collection of poetry books and a few paintings that she has bought from aspiring artists. She bought them because the paintings spoke to her, not becuase she expects them to rise in price.
