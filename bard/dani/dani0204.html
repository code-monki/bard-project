<UL><B>Background:</B>
   <UL>
  


	Born 22/XI/1167, Eyosha Kayla (Dawn Child of the Clan Kayla) was the daughter of eminent artist Doric Kayla, her mother, and Senior Professor of Advanced Philosophical and Theological Concepts, Mars Kayla, her father.  Due to her father's occupation she spent her formative years on the grounds of the University of Gwynmark.  From an early age Eyosha possessed an almost unquenchable curiosity and wanderlust, it seemed that she was destined to be an explorer.<P>


<B>1180-1184</B><P>
	Upon reaching the age of maturity Eyosha attends the University of Gwynmark.  Majoring in History, Medicine and Geography she excels at all of her classes and graduates with honors.  It is during her stay at the University that she encounters Professors Nahani and Burata.<P>

	Professor Burata once claims that both he and Professor Nahani are travelers from a distant star and due to an unfortunate series of events he and his colleague became stranded on Spires.  He further claimed that the place where he and Professor Nahani had lived before the "great war" had brought them here passed through the heavens once every one-hundred and twenty minutes.<P>

	However, the Professor's story is quickly dismissed by the faculty as an alcohol induced hallucination.  This did not stop Eyosha from turning her gaze skyward.  Six months later she had discovered four separate luminous objects that passed through the night-sky every one hundred and twenty minutes.  Spurred on by her discovery of the objects in the sky, Eyosha began tracking down other elements in Professor Burata's story.<P>


<B>1185-1188</B><P>

	In the early spring of 1185 Eyosha had finally gathered enough information which seemed to indicate that Burata and Nahani's crash site lay somewhere in the Rhymwal Mountains not far from the port town of Caelebis.  Three months later, after traversing an entire continent on foot, Eyosha arrived in Caelebis.  From here she set out on a series of systematic searches of the surrounding lands returning every two months for supplies and information.  Eyosha follows this pattern for two and a half years, then, in the summer of 1187, she simply vanishes for a period of slightly more than a year.<P>

	Details of her whereabouts at this time are sketchy at best and she herself claims to remember little.  However, it does seem likely that she was abducted by a free trader crew for sometime before finally being released.<P>

	When she finally returns to Caelebis it is to be found, semi-conscious, on the doorstep of a small farmer's cottage near the edge of town, two small children cradled in her arms (Eyosha and Doric).  The clothing she was dressed in was of an exotic, synthetic polymer, composition and there were minute traces of physical abuse still evident on her body, whether this was self-inflicted of externally induced is still unknown.  The most dramatic change was one of a physical nature, her hair, once a dark and lustrous shade of brown, was now the color of fresh snow.<P>

	For five days she lapsed in and out of consciousness as she lay in the town healer's infirmary all the while murmuring some strange and often incoherent tale.  There were moments of complete lucidity.  Moments where she told of a glass man who taught her a different tongue.  Moments where she described life on an alabaster ship that sailed though the stars.  It was during these moments, moments of utter clarity that local artists came to recreate the "visions of madness."<P>

	There were other times when her speech, though clear, was that of a high pitched tongue which, "though pleasant sounding in its blend of consonants and vowels was to abrupt to be spoke by any civilized creature" (Sharpie Itan, Village Elder).<P>

	Finally there were those moments, when her fever was at its highest, that she lapsed into frightening moments of utterly primal terror and it was during these times that her visions were most terrifying.  She spoke of darkness and cold, of screaming spirits and tortured souls and of a pale woman watching dispassionately from the dark.  A woman with, "eyes that could see right though a person's spirit" (Myrisan O'tala, Town Healer).  Once, she was so terrified she simply curled into a tiny ball and screamed, tears streaming down her face.<P>

	It was from these final visions that the people of Caelebis named her, D'zvyadya'ayanishi.  Literally, "She who walks the shadows at death's side."  The name stuck and she has been known as D'zvyadya'ayanishi, or Shadow-Walker, ever since.<P>
<B>1189-1192</B><P>

	Nearly cataleptic with her terrifying visions and subject to occasional raving fits or intense bouts of melancholia, the people of Caelebis decided they were in no condition to provide the best people to care for this frightening woman, so in the spring of 1189 the village healer and two strong men began the mountainous trek to the Eranokian Sanctuary with Kayla (as she will be referred to from this point on) and the two children in tow.  It was during this three month journey that a sense of normalcy returned to her actions and she became more acutely aware of her surroundings.  She even began to take an active role in caring for the children.  They seem to have provided a focus for her, something she desperately needed to dispel her waking visions.  Upon arriving at the Sanctuary the teachers/masters quickly focus their attentions on rebuilding Kayla's life.<P>

	Channeling her confusion and anger towards a singular focus Kayla quickly masters the arts of L'taran (single handed blade combat) and Hyffari (martial arts).  She quickly becomes one of the most effective guards at the sanctuary and is quickly promoted to the post of Kastran (watch leader).  However, because of her highly focused nature she grows ever more distant to the children.<P>

	Late in 1191 a Free-Trader starship from the world of Vras (Aubaine) lands at the Sanctuary.  Contact is fruitless at first, as neither party is capable of understanding the other.  Kayla, the only person on this side of the continent who understands any Anglic, has little desire to meet with the off worlders due to past experiences.  However, after much coercion from the masters at the sanctuary she finally agrees to talk with the captain of the Free-Trader.  Within a matter of hours a cordial relationship is established and rough trading agreements are hammered out between the Sanctuary and the trader.  Relations officially begin with the rest of Spires some eight months later.<P>

	The captain of the ship, now a businessman on Aubaine, offers Kayla the opportunity 
to be the first of her people to attend the newly constructed Hiver Technical Academy and after 
careful deliberation she decides that this is probably the best way to vanquish her own personal
 ghosts.  The children remain at the Sanctuary.<P>
<B>1193-1196</B><P>

	Sat competitive examinations for Advanced Technical Training, passed, and was accepted into Hiver Technical Academy, Aubaine.  Graduated with BA's in 1196.<P>


<B>1197-1200</B><P>
	Entered Dawn League service as a Marine.  First two years were spent in garrison duties 
on Aubaine and Aurora.  Trained as a back-up member for the marine contingent assigned to the 
original Twelve Traders, but remained on Aurora during the mission inception.  Following the loss 
of the Twelve in late 1199, Kayla was assigned to the rescue force.  Shipped out with DLS 
<i>Ashtabula</I> under command of Sean "Hammer" Lathrop.  As a member of <I>Ashtabula</I>'s marine complement, was present at the actions on Montezuma, Nicosia and Vezina.<P>

	Suffered severe wounds during the Vezina operation, when her Lieutenant, Darnel "Quick Draw" McGraw, was killed by a plasma bazooka.  Large fragments of his combat armor pierced her thigh armor and smashed her helmet.  These injuries were serious enough that they required hospitalization and re-assignment to light duties for the remainder of the term of service.  <P>

	Discharged with honors from the Dawn League Marines (now Reformation Coalition Marine Corps.) 28/VII/1200.<P>


<B>1201</B><P>

	Junior member of the Spiri Cultural Mission to the Coalition Assembly.  Recruited into Reformation Coalition Exploratory Service by "Hammer" Lathrop in Taurus, 1201.  Underwent RCES Basic Familiarization Course on Aubaine, posted to Operations Division 11/VI/1201, assigned to the RCNV <I>Thunderchild</I>.<P>
