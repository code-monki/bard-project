     <UL> Private Investigator in Trantown/Aubaine</UL>
</UL>

<UL><B>Background:</B>
   <UL>
   A retired police captain in teh Trantown city police,  Donohue is now a private investigator.
    Donohue does not like his given names, and usually uses "D.M.
    Donohue" on most of his identification documents. If pressed for
    the meaning of "D. M.", he will reply with a standard  line: "I
    don't like what it means, and I don't use what it means. I'd
    rather be called 'Flatfoot' than by my right name."  He first
    used the line when he decided to go into law enforcement;
    unfortunately (or maybe not), the rest of his class in police training
    picked up on it.  It has become comfortable as a nickname, and if
    he is brought into an adventure where a taccode or similar call
    is needed, he will voluntarily use "Flatfoot".
   <P>
    Referees should equip him (remembering to deduct from his  funds,
    above) as befits an ex-cop.  Be sure to include a slug pistol of
    some sort, preferably one similar to what the Trantown PD uses as
    its standard firearm (probably 9mm semi-auto).  Trantown PD rules
    allow him to wear a Trantown PD uniform on ceremonial  occasions,
    without  the  police  shield  or  unit  identifiers.

 <UL><B>Motivation:</B>
    <UL><I>Diamond Queen:</I> Lustful Donohue sees  himself  as  God's gift
         to women, or, perhaps more accurately, as a sex god
         himself.  He does not believe that any woman  can  resist his
         charm, since "I practically ooze sex appeal".  Obviously,
         any woman that doesn't immediately want to go to bed with
         him is a "frigid b*tch".  People  who  know  him  suggest that
         by his standards, easily half the population of Trantown
         (the female half) qualifies as "frigid".

    </UL><P>
    <UL><I>Club 8:</I> Ambitious.  Donohue wants to become the
         greatest private investigator ever seen on Aubaine.
         Unfortunately, his skills are clearly weak in the areas
         where a detective needs strength.  Such is the fortune of
         staff and administrative assignments.  He has made an
         effort to acquire some of the skills he needs, but  seems to
         lack the willpower needed to stay the course.

<UL><B>Contacts:</B>
   <UL>

         Chief of Starport Security Forces.  As a
		      Lieutenant, Donohue was appointed the Detail
		      Commander of the  Starport  Security  Supplement.
		      as such, he was required to coordinate  SSS  activities
		      with  those  of  the  regular  starport  security forces.
		      Donohue's detail was responsible for the
		      apprehension of an important link in a major
		      smuggling ring.
		<P>
		      Chief of Staff to the  Coalition  General  Secretary.
		      Captain Donohue was in charge of arranging  security
		      for the General Secretary for a public appearance
		      on Reformation Day.  Their relationship is one of
		      "personal friends" because of an affinity of
		      personality, rather than because of any specific
      police-related activity.
      <P>
      Chief of Patrol, Trantown PD.  Donohue's mentor
	        during his career on the force.  Used his pull to
	        get Donohue assigned to certain choice details,
	        such  as  the   Starport   Security   Supplement.
	        Donohue has done favors for him in the past, and
	        will  do so in the future.
	  <P>
	        Commanding Officer,  Trantown  PD  Public  Morals Unit
	        ("Vice Squad").  Donohue is owed favors by this
	        individual, due to several good tips provided to
	        Donohue by certain underworld  figures  in  Trantown.
