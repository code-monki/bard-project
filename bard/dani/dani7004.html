    Aragishge Drandirdiikun (Vilani: "The Architects of Tomorrow"):  A
    quasi-religious  charitable  organisation dedicated to the better-
    ment of society for the benefit of posterity.  Founded in -2484 on
    Daibei  by  a  breakaway group of disciples of Dekumagi Shilaaguk.
    Unlike  him  these  disciples  did  not  reject the existence of a
    supreme  being,  but merely declared such an existence unprovable.
    The Aragishge thus allowed people of all faiths to join as long as
    they believed in the goals of the organisation. This made it popu-
    lar  with a large section of the population and ensured its spread
    throughout  Daibei Sector  and deep into surrounding sectors.  The
    Long Night  shattered  the  coherence of the organisation,  but it
    survived  in  the form of small local organisations on hundreds of
    planets.
