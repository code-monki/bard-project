<A HREF="dani1601.html">Biowarfare</A> Rules<P>



The <I>LS Crichton</I> was a specialized ship, heavily modified from a
<I>Kashuggin</I> class modular freighter (large, streamlined,with modules
attached, Jump 4 cargo 50-60,000 tons, someone else can try doing the
complete design ).  The <I>Crichton</I> was designed to
be a self-contained biowarfare lab ship, one that covered all aspects,
from design and construction of the agents, to culturing to field-test
levels, to field testing and evaluation of the agents.  There are many
confirmed reports of biological weapons being used during the
Rebellion, and the <I>Crichton</I> was actually deployed several years prior
to the rebellion, and was originally used as an epidemic response
facility, not biowarfare; that use came after the start of the
Rebellion.
<P>

The ship consisted of four, self contained 10 kton modules in
addition to the freighter's functional backbone. Each module has its
own TL 15 computer system, life support, power, laboratory and crew
quarters. Actual crew requirements were minimal, since, as a safety
feature, each lab system was heavily roboticized.  All manipulations
of any agents took place in physically isolated sections of the lab
modules, under either robotic or remote contol by the human crew.
Three of the four modules were synthesis, diagnosis and production
(SDP) facilities, the fourth was a survey and field testing (FT)
unit.
<P>


Each of the three SP units was specialized to one of three main
targets of the agents: Sophont, plant and animal agents. in this
fashion the peculiar environmental and test subjects required for all
three fields of research did not share any facilities, reducing
cross-contamination risks.
<P>


Field testing ready agents were sealed into uniform delivery
canisters, and transported through decontamination airlocks to the
FT unit.  The agents were then to be delivered to the target site,
and monitored via remote control sensor platforms and orbital
reconnaisance.
<P>


The sensor suites, however, are very good, and cover a wide range of
data types.  The remote sensor platforms were equipped with sampling
devices and modified security robots that could recover just about
anything from a bacterium to a large domestic animal.  If necessary
the FT unit also had light battledress with full CBW protection for
the use of researchers if necessary. Vaccsuits with full CBW
capabilities were available in the SDP modules in case of an
emergency.
<P>


The <I>Crichton</I> itself was rather heavily armed, with 4x4x4 systems (4
laser batteries, 4 missile batteries, and 4 sandcaster batteries,
each battery consisting of 4 weapons each) a common Solomani
merchant heavy defense package. The <I>Crichton</I> was also modified to perform
orbital bombing of planetary sites...this was to be done with nuclear
weapons, and was intended to sterilize the site of infection if
desired. When this story started it had 25 such weapons on board.
<P>


The Solomani corporation that owned the <I>Crichton</I> was ElsenGen
Biologicals, ostensibly a pharmaceutical R&D corporation based on
Fornorb, an industrial center in the Magyar sector.  ElseGen had
gotten covert Solomani Defense contracts to do research into
biowarfare weapons and defenses; they were given the <I>SS Greenhope</I>,
which was a <I>Kashuggin</I> class modular freighter converted to a
epidemic response hospital ship.  ElseGen refitted the <I>Greenhope</I>
extensively, and renamed it the <I>LS Michael Crichton</I>, after a late XXth
Century Terran writer who wrote a novel about an extraterrestrial
plague.
<P>


Somehow, publicity got out that the true purpose of the <I>Crichton</I> and
the programs funding it were to develop offensive weapons.
Solomani High Command got cold feet regarding the use of biowarfare
weapons and shut down the ElseGen projects. The ElseGen Corporation
itself was discredited badly; the stock plummeted to nothing, and
the corporation was dissolved.  The executive officers of ElseGen
were arrested by Fornorb authorities, and convicted and executed on
charges of terrorism. A core group of ElseGen technicians and
scientists, enraged at the Solomani Confederation's desertion of
them, stole the <I>Crichton</I>, and vanished into the Dark Nebula sector.
<P>


A year later a ship jumped into the Fornorb system, with a very high
speed entry vector for Fornorb, and after a brief battle, destroyed
the SDB that attempted to intercept it.  The mystery ship made no
attempt to stop at Fornorb, but dropped a number of what appeared to
be small self-guided re-entry submunitions. They all apparently
burned or broke up in the upper atmosphere.
<P>


Soon, however, the sickness started. A new, multi-drug resistant
disease appeared, apparently simultaneously, in all areas of the
planet. The disease had a rapid course, producing death in 7 to 10
days in over 95% of the cases, and was rapidly spread via airborne
contact.  Millions died in the first month, and the Confederation
had to quarantine the planet, and watch helplessly as the formerly
high poulation planet dwindled to a few thousand survivors. SolSec
analysis of  remaining sensor and 'black-box' data from the wreckage of
the SDB showed that the mystery ship seemed to be of Aslan design,
with no identifiable clan or other markings.
<P>


One of the submunitions failed to re-enter the atmosphere, and
months after the outbreak of the plague, a recovery team captured it
before the orbit decayed. The provenance of the submunition was
unmistakable; it was Solomani in design, and in fact, bore a lot
number corresponding to one issued to ElseGen for testing purposes.
It contained a previously unknown virus in aerosol dispersal
containers. Analysis of the virus showed that it was the one causing
the plague.  This enabled a vaccine to be rapidly developed, which
brought the disease under control on Fornorb.
<P>


Solomani reaction to this was muted, for they couldn't very well
castigate the Aslan publicly for using biowarfare without Solomani
involvement in ElseGen coming out.  Privately, the Hierate
Intelligence service also examined the evidence and were also unable
to positively identify the ship involved.  The Hierate, however,
reassured the Confederation on the honor of the Hierate that they
were not actively engaged in biowarfare against the Confederation.
<P>


In any case, the <I>Crichton</I> was never seen in Confederation space again.
<P>


Fragmentary reports out of Aslan Hierate space indicate that the
ship travelled through the Dark Nebula sector hiring out services to
ihatei leaders invading Imperial space in the Trojan Reach and
Spinward Marches sectors.  There is sketchy evidence that the
<I>Crichton</I> was behind 'designer' plagues in several sectors during the
end stages of the Rebellion 1120-1130, possibly including whatever
caused the disease on Hexos (Spinward Marches 2828) .  The last
confirmed appearance of the <I>Crichton</I> was in Zarushagar in 1126. The
ship was presumed lost in the chaos following the release of Virus.
<P>

<hr>



The <I>Crichton</I> was an unusual ship, in that it had 5 separate TL-15
computer systems.  When it was infected with Virus, 5 separate
personalites emerged: Trojan, Lander, Gateway, GreenMom, and Doc.
<P>


Trojan eventually became a Empire Builder-Doomslayer hybrid, and
controls the ship's main systems, including jump drive, weapons, and
fuel collection and purification.
<P>


Lander is the computer that controlled the field testing units, and
was damaged during an encounter with a puppeteer strain in 1175.
Control over its robotic landers is not perfect anymore, and it trusts no
one but Trojan now.
<P>


Gateway is a Hobbyist/Empire Builder; it runs the animal agent
module with rather murderous efficiency in support of Trojan's hatred
of living things.
<P>


Doc is a Hobbyist/God strain, with a rather twisted sense of humor.
Doc controls the sophont module.  It will make agents for Trojan to
inflict on mostly human populations, but they won't always mesh with
Trojan's plans, since Doc will often decide to experiment with
different effects. Doc, however, has the largest number of self
mobile robots, and it therefore has a stranglehold on Trojan, who is
dependent on Doc's robots for maintenance. There are three human
populations in Zarugashar sector with heritable color changes wrought
by Doc plagues. One is bright orange (from the accumulation of
carotenes from the diet), another has zebra stripes running over
their bodies, and yet another has blue, irridescent spots instead of
body hair.
<P>

GreenMom is a withdrawn pure Hobbyist. It is entirely self absorbed
in its own module, growing different plant things. Trojan once, in
order to coerce GreenMom into supplying a plant plague, shut off
GreenMom's fuel supply. Before the fusion reactor in GreenMom's
sector went entirely dead, large sections of GreenMom's hull were
replaced from within by extremely tough material, transparent to the
wavelengths optimal for photosynthesis.
<P>


GreenMom's systems slowly came back to full power, all contacts
with Trojan or the rest of the ship except for a single low speed
communication line were cut off, and the fusion reactor went cold.
Trojan has no recourse but to physically destroy GreenMom, and that
would potentially cause great damage to itself and the other modules.
Since that time, GreenMom has bartered mutated plants and plant
agents with Trojan in return for carbonaceous and metallic asteroid
material. A planet in the Gushemege sector has one of those mutated
plants, a rapidly growing strain of kudzu vine that has wiped out all
other life on three of the four continents of the planet.
<P>


Trojan uses agents developed, primarily by Doc and Gateway, to
barter for parts and supplies it needs with other vampires and
fleets. It has also subjugated some human planets with the threat of
plague for needed maintenence. It is quite successful at this;
coupled with the large number of adaptable robots on board, and the
minimal combat damage the Crichton has taken over the intervening
years, means that the ship is in quite good shape.
<P>



A true survey of the wilds would show over a hundred diseases and
invasive plants and animals that have been released by the Crichton
and others over the years.  Trojan has convinced three other ships
to join its fleet; all jump capable warships.
<P>


The <I>Crichton</I> is a dangerous and implacable foe; this should never
be a vampire that the PCs beat in battle, but a ghost, or a rumor of
a terrible destroyer of life.  The PCs should encounter its effects
more often than they ever encounter the ship.
<P>


Anyone running such a munchkin campaign that the PCs DO take on the
<I>Crichton</I> and win should be aware that the three SDP modules Doc,
Gateway, and particularly GreenMom, are priceless troves of
biotechnology.
<P>


Daring PCs, (along with RCES Peacekeeper allies) could even co-opt
GreenMom, by giving it access to materials, and an environment more
conducive to its obsession. However, never expect anything very
quickly from GreenMom ... it runs on plant timeframe. Slow, very slow.
<P>
