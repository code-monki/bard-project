	<b>Player</b>: Rob is a very experienced roleplayer and a founding member of
our group in 1993, he loves
psionics or technical characters (eg Riggers in Shadowrun). For this
game he decided to be the son of
poor farmers on Spires, who somehow found himself amongst the stars, he
also desperately wanted to be
psionically active. He decided on two terms before recontact.<p>
	<b>GM Comment</b>: Players have to choose in advance how many terms they wish
to serve before their worlds
are contacted by either the Dawn League or Hivers, this severely affects
the the available skills and
careers. Due to this the only careers available to Alun prior to 1196
are barbarian, construction worker,
criminal(rare), entertainer, farmer and martial artist.<p>
	<b>Term 1</b>: A 16 year old and very rebellious Alun left the farm to became
a monk (Martial artist),
against the wishes of his parents, he had no desire to be 'boring' all
his life. The monks discovered his
raw psionic strength and he trained hard, although despite his
outstanding psionic potential he just could
not seem to use any talents other than telepathy. As his four year
apprenticeship came to a close Alun
planned to devote his life to martial arts, but fate had very different
ideas. A Free Trader landed in the
mountains near to his monastry's retreat and this changed his whole
life. The elders decided that it as
necessary to investigate this new situation and Alun was nominated
(ordered) to go with the Traders and
learn about the universe; being an obedient person he reluctantly went.<p>
	<b>GM Comment</b>: I start careers at age 16. Rob wanted to be a Barbarian but
I ruled that Martial arts
was the only way he could get psionics, then in revenge he rolled a
maximum for psionic strength :-> but
luck smiled kindly on me when he failed all his talent rolls bar
telepathy. The free trader incident was
a special adventure, prior to contact if you get a special
adventure/duty I roll 2 dice, on a double it
involves off-worlders of some sort. <p>
	<b>Term 2</b>: Alun visited most of the worlds that would be soon become the
Dawn League on the 'Lucky
Day' where he served as firstly a general gofer, but soon started to
assist the purser with negotiations
on worlds, he also happened to be on Aubaine during the first contact
with the Hivers (although not
directly involved.) He also saw what the devastation of Virus had done
to the other worlds, the sights 
disgusted him.<p>
	<b>Term 3</b>: Continued serving on the 'Lucky Day' becoming a valued member
of the crew, mainly due to
his hard work and desire to suceed at any task given him.  By this time
Alun had decided that he did not
like what he could see of the universe and came to realise how much he
missed life on the farm. In 1199
Alun returned home for his first visit in 8 years. He resigned from the
crew and started to return to his
home determined to make peace with his parents and remain on the farm
for the rest of his days. However he
was instructed by his elders to join the RCES as he had excellent skills
and knowledge of the outer spaces, although it nearly broke his heart he
obeyed and serves the RCES with total dedication.<p>

	 	
Alun is a dedicated member of the RCES devoted to returning civilisation
to the Wilds, (whilst turning
a small but healthy profit).  Openly determined to make lots of money
for himself and his teammates,
Alun is an accomplished trader always on the lookout for a money making
scheme. Despite his enthusiasm
for the Coalition and his good interpersonal skills Alun is an introvert
who spends a lot of time alone
meditating in his cabin. He very rarely speaks of life on Spires or why
he left the planet. He keeps his telepathic skills secret, even from
his shipmates.<p>

<b>Long Term Goals</b>: to return to Spires and peacefully return to his farm
and never, ever leave it again.<p>

<b>Secret Info</b>: Alun is a natural psionic of enormous potential, but few
skills most of the time he
spends alone he uses to practise his psionic skills. He secretly hates
life away from his farm
on Spires but can only return when his sensei allows him to, in the
meantime he understands the
importance of the task given him, so he makes the best of things.
