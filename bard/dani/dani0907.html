<UL><B>History:</B> 
</UL>
<UL><B>Contacts:</B>
<UL><B>Daylenn Morridan</B>: Agent of Special Intelligence Services.  Morridan is
currently a covert agent for the Auroran government.  He served several 
years in the Army as a commando.  You met him during this time, while on a 
mission together.  He is an expert in all forms of personal combat, and has
an instinct for figuring out what the enemy is going to do next.  He also
has a talent for throwing himself into dangerous situations, after which
he often needed to avail himself of your talents. At times you think he has
a deathwish.  You last saw him a year or so ago, after he succesfully 
infiltrated and destroyed an organlegger gang.  As far as you know he
is still active as an agent.<BR><BR>

<B>Dr Orit "Physic" Takagawa</B>: Dr Takagawa came to Aurora to serve her internship
at the military hospital where you were serving, in 1199. She was assigned
to you. Over the next few years you became good friends. She is from 
Aubaine, and after completing her internship she went back to Aubaine and 
joined the RCES.  Last you knew she was stuck in the research division, but
she always told you she wanted to serve on a starship and explore the stars.
She is quite naive about the dangers, but she never listened when you tried
to tell her of them.  She is 27 years old, and is married to August Delparo,
president of Novastar Inc of Aubaine.  You only met him once but he seemed
to be a fairly arrogant man.(For more information on Dr Takagawa see
<I>The Death of Wisdom</I> and <I>To Dream of Chaos</I>.)<BR><BR>

<B>Capt Flint "Deadeye" Morn</B> is captain of the <I>RCN Eos</I>, one of its newest and best clippers.
You met Flint when he was still a newly commisioned officer in 1194.  He was
real cocky and got into a bar fight with a huge bouncer.  The bouncer threw
Flint threw a plate glass window.  Flint suffered numerous cuts and abrassions
to his posterior regions.  You fixed up his wounds and helped keep the story
quiet.  After this you became good friends.  He is still pretty cocky, but
now at least has some talent to back it up with.<BR><BR>

<B>Dr Vryce Killdeone</B> You and Vryce both attended the same medical academy at
the same time, but didn't meet until years later, when you were both at the 
same medical conference.  You realized that you had several mutual friends
and spent the conference spreading stories about absent collegues and 
college pranks.  <BR><BR>
    Dr Killdeone is a big conspirecy buff, he keeps track of dozens of 
different plots and schemes.  You are not sure that these all truly exist, but Vryce
assures you that they do.  He seems to know quite a few people in the 
government and in the security forces.  He trades information about the
plots with others who can help him fill in the missing pieces.  He doesn't
have an axe to grind, he just wants to know all the secrets. <BR><BR>
</UL>
<B>Information:</B>
<UL>Morridan has told you that there is a network of psionics that are trying
to overthrow the government.  The network has been active since the fall
of the Last Imperium. They have been slowly infiltrating government and the
military.  Once they secretly control enough forces they will try to seize
control overtly and create a psionically dominated government.  <BR><BR>

You have seen many intelligence briefings which suggest that there is a 
Vampire Highway operating in Diaspora Sector.  Vampire ships seem to flow
from Massilia Sector through the trailing subsectors of Diaspora and flow
into the Solomani Rim.  A lesser number of ships goes the reverse journey.
Reports of occasional battles between fleets of Vampires have been heard 
from the Free Traders.<BR><BR>

You heard about an Ancient site that was discovered somewhere in Thoezennt
or Shenk Subsectors. The site was discovered late in the Rebellion by the
Solomani Confederation.  News of the site leaked to Margret's faction of 
the Imperium and several pitched battles were fought over the site.  
Many artifacts were carried away by both sides and these artifacts have 
turned up on several worlds of the RC.  <BR><BR>

    The Auroran government has one such artifact.  It is extremly complex
and the government only partially understands the device.  When you saw
the device it regenerated the missing limb of an Argonian clawbeast
(A local critter) in seconds.  Other times it has not performed quite that
well, several tiimes it has disinigrated technicans.<BR><BR>

If the device can be made to work consistently and be duplicated it 
would be a great leap forward for medical science.  The black globes that
Imperial and Solomani warships used were crude copies of Ancient devices.
These devices absorb all energy directed at them and channel it into a 
series of capacitors. It makes for a potent weapon. <BR><BR>
