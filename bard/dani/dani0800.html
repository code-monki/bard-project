<UL><B>Occupation:</B>Director, 
     <!A HREF="dani####.htm">BARD Library</A></UL>
<UL><B>Attributes:</B> <TT>698A9A-7</TT></UL>
<UL><B>Background:</B>
   <UL>Born on Vras on 136-1161, Miller is the son of very common 
parents. His father was a humble, quiet fisherman on Vras and his 
mother worked in a local factory.  Miller was the third of five 
children and his parents barely made enough money to survive much 
less send him to college, so Miller joined the Vras Marines on a 
work school program.  Miller served the Marines for four years 
and was quickly transferred to Intelligence.  Miller became a 
liaison between the military and local police forces.  Often he 
went undercover to help in sting operations against Humanist 
League Organizations on Vras.<P>
Miller's parents both died when he was on a mission in 1191.  He 
has since drifted further and further from his siblings who found 
it difficult to forgive him for not being there.  Miller was soon 
recalled by the military to work with the newly foroming 
interstellar community.  Shortly after the Dawn League was 
established, Miller was sent on a mission to neighboring Phoebus, 
and after working 6 months undercover, Millier was injured in a 
fall during a mountain climbing trip.  Miller was returned to 
Aubaine and given the proper medical treatment and he recovered.<P>
Miller's recovery was kept a secret, and he was made into a 
public hero by the Dawn league government and in 1198 he was 
given a Purple Heart and a Medal of Honor.  Miller was assigned 
to head up the BARD Library, a public service offering Library 
information to Dawn League citizens.  Behind the scenes, BARD was 
designed to be the primary clearing house for Dawn League 
intelligence reports.</UL>

<UL><B>Appearance:</B>
   <UL>Miller is slightly shorter than average, measuring in at 
5'11".  He is slim at 64kg.  He has dark brown hair, cut very 
short, but not quite in a crew cut.  He has blue eyes that 
always seem alive with life.  Miller will usually be found 
wearing a casual outfit and when the weather calls for it, a 
Flight Jacket given to him by a close friend in the Navy.  
Although he owns several, Miller rarely wears an RCES body sleeve 
except when visiting the field.  Miller has trained himself to 
limp when he walks even though the surgery was successful.  Also 
as part of his 'immage' he will occasionally flinch or wince as 
though enduring a back spasm.</UL>
</UL>
<UL><B>Personality:</B>
   <UL>Miller is a very funloving person.  When he is not 
concentrating on his work with BARD, Miller will usually be found 
at parties.  Although he recognizes the need for them, Miller 
detests 'official function of state' parties and generally 
despizes having to mill with the upper crust of society.  Miller 
is much more comfortable in a corner bar with a group of friends.<P>
Millers first dedication is the BARD project.  Although he will 
seldom admit it, Miller is often more inspired by the outward 
public library function of BARD than he is by the intelligence 
side.  When he is working on the intelligence side, Miller is 
very devoted to the project.  Miller firmly believes that the 
failure of the original 12 ships was due to a lack of proper
intelligence gathering beforehand.</UL>
</UL>
<UL><B>Motivation:</B>
   <UL><I>Diamond Ace:</I> Miller is a generous person.  He will 
     often give to friends in need, but seldom gives money, as he 
     would rather supply the item needed than impersonal money.  
     He does get paid for his work, he has often tried to 
     persuade the Assembly committe that he reports to that he 
     doesn't want the money.</UL>
   <UL><I>Spade Nine:</I> Miller is dedicated to the RC's success.  
     He is very ambitious for the RC to succeed.  Miller often 
     has worked night and day when sorting information to prepare 
     a RCES group for a certain mission.</UL>
</UL>
<UL><B>Refereeing Philibus:</B>
   <UL>Quite simply, Miller is an information source and 
potential patron to the PC's.  Miller is the go between for the 
Free Trader Network and other RCES Intelligence Operatives.  
Often Miller will be called on to present reports to PC's who are 
going out into the Wilds for a mission.  He may have even designed 
the mission.  Miller will be there for debriefings and will often 
offer to meet with the PC's for a drink or two after the debriefing.<P>
Miller also was given a Far Trader by the RC for his dedication 
and devotion.  Although the ship has a standard crew, Miller 
might hire the PC's as freelancers to crew the ship while the 
other crew is taking vacation. The PC's might even get hired on 
as a new crew for Miller's ship.  Most of the missions are for 
information gathering, but they have also proven to be quite 
profitable thus far.</UL>

<UL><B>Quotes:</B>
   <UL>"That's amazing, I didn't know that." - While taking notes 
     on a computer pad.</UL>
   <UL>"Any mission you send out without getting adequate 
     intelligence first is bound for failure.  The fact that none 
     have failed yet is sheer luck, but eventualy you will have 
     to live with the death of those kids on your conscience." - 
     To RCES Mission Planners.</UL>
   <UL>"Well, its been a long day, what say we all head over to 
     the Watering Hole and unwind?" - To BARD Staff.</UL>
