<UL><B>Background:</B>
   <UL>As a Port Inspector on Bevy/Rhylanor/Spinward Marches, Ms. tri D'vanfair has enormous power over the comings & goings of the smaller
ship's (under 1000 Disp), especially Free Traders who don't have a Corp. to look out for them.
Heading a 3-5 man ship inspection team, she can declare a starship, crew members or a cargo load
"hazzardus", impounding them until a formal hearing is held.
<P>
She has a common-law husband and five children, three of which have left home. Her parent's also live with her. She was born on Risek/Rhylanor/Spinward Marches.

<UL><B>Appearance:</B>
   <UL> In line with Risek fashion (which is itself heavily influenced by Rhylanor), tri D'vanfair prefers to
wearbiogeneered clothing with it's biolumenesent (glow-in-the-dark, for those with trouble with my
spelling) colours and an overpowering fagrance. Her stolid, double-chinned face is traced with faint
red tatto lines, identifying her as a member of the D'vanfair clan of Bevy. A synthetic `halo' - a visual
effect eminating from a cap she wears - completes the effect.
</UL>
</UL>
<UL><B>Personality:</B>
   <UL> Loud and getting louder. According to the starship captain's who have the pleasure of her company,
she is rude, crass and ignorant of the first principles of starship operation. About the only way to
avoid being entangled in a writhing mass of red tape is to continually "feed Herself with small but
valuable gifts." (their words)
<P>
If you talk to her family and her social peer's, though, you'd hear the story of a generous and
musically talented woman, always willing to help out anyone in need. Even a few traders are willing
to sing her praises: the most legendary tale revolves on how she faced down both the Starport
Administrator and the Commandant of the Navy base to retify a gross injustice done to one of "Her"
merchants. </UL>
