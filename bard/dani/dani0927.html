Rutger Wolfe was born on Oriflamme in 1174.  <P>


The Wolfes were a rather poor family living in a crime-ridden district 
in one of Oriflamme's larger cities.  
Living in a dangerous area, Rutger learned how to get by "on the
streets", 
both by his wits and by his fists.  <P>

Rutger was always fascinated by mechanical toys, 
and he would always be taking them apart 
(and less often, putting them back together).  
Eventually (when he started working and could afford them), 
he started doing this with electronic gadgets as well.  <P>

In 1191, Rutger was drafted into the Oriflammen Army.  
After graduating from basic training, 
Rutger was assigned to the motor pool, 
where he worked on the vehicles for his unit.  <P>

He performed his duties well, but even more importantly, 
he learned about "comaraderie" and the various activies 
available to soldiers at night.  <P>

In 1195, after fulfilling the obligations of his draft,

to attend a two-year technical academy.

<HR>

<B>Term 3</B><P>
In 1197, after graduating from the technical school, 
Rutger was hired by a technarch-sponsored trader as an engineer's
apprentice.  <P>

This trader made frequent trips to the Wilds 
(especially to the "Backside" of the RC).  
These trips were quite violent more often than not.  <P>


Because of the amount of violence he witnessed (both with this trader 
and in the army), and because the senior engineer died in his arms 
during an incident in the Wilds, Rutger decided to learn first aid.  <P>

<UL><B>Appearance:</B>
   <UL>
Rutger Wolfe is a large (100 kg.), well-muscled man of above-average
height, 
with close-cropped blond hair and pale green eyes.  
He favors wearing simple utilitarian ship's crew uniforms in muted
colors 
(tan being his preferred color) with his "lucky" blue ballcap 
sporting the logo of his hometown sports team.  
He is friendly and outgoing, and he gets along well with others 
(except for blatant idiots; he tries to avoid those; 
see "Motivations" below for a more in-depth explanation).   </UL>
</UL>
 
<UL><B>Motivation:</B>
   <UL><I>Hearts:</I> 
Rutger truly enjoys being with people.  
He enjoys a night out on the town, "painting the town red", 
and he enjoys "poker night" as well.  <P>

He has also been a "good son" by taking care of his parents.  
Over the years, he's sent a fair amount of his salary 
to his parent to help them make ends meet.  
Although he's not greedy for his own sake, 
he'd be open to an opportunity for a large score 
if for no other reason than to improve his ability to support his
parents. </UL>
   <UL><I>Clubs:</I> 
Rutger has seen plenty of violence in his life, starting with his
childhood.  
Although he'd really rather not see any more violence, 
and he usually goes out of his way to avoid it, 
he's not the least bit intimidated by it.  
("Beware the fury of the quiet man." -- ancient Solomani saying)  
<P>
In fact, he has used his fists on more than one occasion to "reinforce"
a repeat lesson in shipboard safety when the earlier lessons didn't
"take".  
("_HOW_ [thud] many _TIMES_ [thud] have I _TOLD_ [thud] you that's
_NOT_ 
[thud] the _WAY_ [thud] to _CHECK_ [thud] someone's _VAC_ [thud]
suit!!!")  </UL>
