<UL><B>Background:</B>
   <UL>Rashid was born one of the Orbital Arcologies 
     that survived the Short Night. He always dreamed of 
     being a great hero, and saw the Marines as his 
     chance to be that hero. Soon after joining he began 
     to butt heads with Marine officers. This didn't do 
     his career much good. After one term he transfered 
     to the Oriflamme Special Forces. He served three 
     terms specializing in security for high ranking 
     officials. He can often be found as the bodyguard 
     for a Technarch who is traveling through the 
     Coalition or beyond.</UL>
