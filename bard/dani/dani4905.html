<UL><B>Background:</B>
   <UL>
A portly, arrogant man from a rich agricultural world, Zautienzhvlaz is a walking turn-off to his fellow
graduate students at MRO University. With his thich accent and less-than-perfect command of
Anglic (he refuses to use his translator outside of class, perferring to pratice his incomprehensable
Anglic instead), Zautienzhvlaz endlessly preaches the superiority of Zhodani civilization to anyone
within striking distance.
<P>
He hates the Nobility. He hates the Democratic reforms. He hates the immoral entertainment
districts. He hates the clumsiness of Regency design. He hates Regency art. He _vocally_ hates
anything that suggests either greed or deceit. About the only thing he likes is the psionic reforms,
that he feels will inevitabily lead to the Regency becoming Just Like Zhodane. And whenever
possible, he will rub the PC's noses into the fact that the Collapse was caused by Imperials, and the
Consulate was untouched by it.
<P>
Why is Zautienzhvlaz in the Regency at all, over 110 parsec's from home? Mainly because he cannot
believe that the Imperials crushed the Zhodane navy at Rhylanor, ending the Fifth Frontier War
(1107 - 1110). His doctorate, focusing on the battle, is his intellectual attempt to explain away this
defeat. He also has an interest in robotics, and was profoundly dissapointed to learn that the
Rhylanor Institute of Technology was closed down, giving him one more thing to whine about.
<P>
He was born on Fia'epkiar in Yiklerdanzh Sector which is two sectors spinward of the Spinward Marches
