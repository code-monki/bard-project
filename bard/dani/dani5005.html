The Khurguudir is a unit of the RCES formed in 1201.  It is based on Aubaine, but has trained on many of the worlds of the RC.

  Khurguudir was the name of a Vilani military unit formed at the dawn of the First Imperium, tasked with exploring the frontiers and reporting back to the Emperor.  The modern incarnation of the Khurguudir is tasked with covert operations and intelligence gathering.  What distinguishes the  Khurguudir from other covert operations is their approach and their methodology.  The group is organized in a very loose military fashion and they have a lack of appreciation of military formalities such as saluting and marching in lines.  In fact the  Khurguudir members often get in brawls with RC marines over their "silly" military behavior.
<P>

There are approximately fifty members in the organization.  The exact number fluctuates as members come and go, and unfortunately as casualties are suffered.  Membership is by invitation only.  When a member encounters someone thet think might make a good member, he nominates the candidate. Often members' contacts will point out promising candidates.  Candidates can be from any walk of life, though many come from within the RCES.   The candidate is then invited to a month long trial/training session.  There are  three of the sessions per year.  All potential candidates are evaluated for the month and if they meet the group's criteria they are invited in.    The group values initiative, physical prowess and the ability to think outside of the box.  Candidates often suffer discipline problems in the regular military, but find a home in the  Khurguudir.
<P>
The  Khurguudir main operational concern  is flexibility.  The RCES often operates without current intelligence, and operations have to be flexible to succeed.  Since it takes weeks to months to get word back to headquarters, local commanders need the ability to make decisions that effect entire worlds.  To do this the  Khurguudir  have created a culture where flexibility is instilled from day one.
<P>
Members of the   Khurguudir train in all forms of personal weapons, both modern and archaic armed and unarmed martial arts, outdoor survival skills, primitive arts such as riding,  parachutes and abilities that allow them to blend in with a local population such as disguise, streetwise and carousing.  They use the special operations career.  The exception being that the character need not have spent a term in the military before enlisting in the  Khurguudir.  Members are often drawn from non-military careers such as scouts (RCES), criminals, hunter/guides, tough etc.  Members often have colorful backgrounds.
<P>
Many of the members have come from the less technological developed worlds of the RC.  There are about 15 members from Spires, several from Phoebus, but only one from Helios.  Several members have been drawn from worlds in the Wilds.
<P>
The Khurguudir are often used in moonshadow operations especially on low tech planets.  They distinguished themselves on Lebherz, Xezor, Montezuma and Nex.   They have also been dropped into hostile planets to sow the seeds for future decapitation raids.  They are often used to make contact with rebels.  On Shenk, they were inserted into the world several months ahead of a decapitation raid, and assassinated several military leaders in order to disrupt the Warlord of Stampach's army.

The Khurguudir tend not to wear the RCES bodysleeve, as many of their missions are covert.  Individual members use a variety of firearms and weapons, depending on what they are most familiar with.
