<H3>PERSONALITIES:</h3>

<h3>Makya, Lynette</h3>
<B>Background</B> Born on Stonehaven in 1166 Lynette is product of the
occupied era.  With bar-code tattoo�s on both her arms she spend the
first twenty years of her life as a prisoner of �Source�.  In 1187 she
escaped from the �Skylight Compound� and joined up with the rebel
underground.  By 1188 she had firmly entrenched herself as a member of
the human resistance and by the time that the rebellion had ended, less
than a year later she was already in charge of her own special team. 
Over the next few years her team successfully eradicated the final
traces of virus from the Stonehaven system.  In 1193, with the invasion
of Aries looming Lynette joined the Stonehaven Navy.  Her vessel saw
extensive combat in both the Aries and Mull systems and she rose through
the ranks quickly.  While the Artemisia is her first official command,
Lynette lacks neither the experience or will power to command a vessel
of this size.<P>

Lynette Makya is a Veteran NPC.<BR>

</table>
<P>
<B>King of Hearts </B>-- Honor is the strongest motivating factor in Lynette�s life.  To
her the concepts of honor and honesty are not merely nebulous terms they
are the tenements of her existence, the very back bone of her soul as it
were.  Lynette never backs down on her word, no matter what the odds. 
If there is a rock aboard the Artemisia, Lynette is that rock.<P>

<B>9 Clubs</B> - Lynette is not above using violence to keep a promise and her years
of service with the Stonehaven Marines ad navy have taught her how to
dish it out with the best of them.<P>

<HR>

<h3>Yardley, Barnett</h3>
<B>Background: </B>Barnett Yardley is the son of a free trader.  Born deep in
Daibei, Barnett�s father experienced a series of misfortunes which
eventually led him into the Stonehaven sub-sector.  Seeing an
opportunity for a normal lifestyle Barnett joined the Stonehaven
explorer corp. in 1199 and was the electronics� officer on the ill-fated
Lakshimi expedition.<P>

</table>
<P>
<B>Ace of Spades</B> -- Barnett is the kind of person who can inspire others with nothing
more than the sound of his voice and as public relations officer there
is none better.  Barnett is a charmer, a ladies man and perhaps one of
the best friends that a person could hope to make.  Barnett always seems
to know just the right thing to say and when to say it.  Some people say
he talked his way off a Vampire ship that was refueling at Stonehaven
before the revolt.  Though Barnett heartily denies it.<P>

<B>6 of Hearts</B> -- Along with his boundless charisma Barnett also feels a strong
sense of loyalty to the crew of the Artemisia.  Barnett will never
willingly abandon a friend nor will he knowingly let a friend get into
more trouble than they can handle.<P>

<HR>

<h3>Erasmus, Oscar</h3>
<b>Background</b>  Oscar is the son of a once wealthy family that survived the
collapse on Mull.  His surroundings taught him how to survive and his
parents taught him what his station would one day be.  His father,
Alfred Erasmus is one of Mull�s Ministers to the Stonehaven Parliament. 
Oscar began his life crawling though the failing atmospheric processors
of Mull, repairing what he could and salvaging what remained.  When his
system was first contacted by survivors from Stonehaven Oscar boarded
the first transport to attend the recently formed, Stonehaven
Underground Academy.  In 1200 he was granted his commission and posted
to the SNV Artemisia.<P>

Oscar Erasmus is an Experienced NPC.<br>

</table>
<P>
<B>9 of Spades </B>-- Oscar is driven.  Driven to become a leader of men and a better
person.  Oscar desires to one day become one of the Confederations
Ministers and to lead their worlds out of the darkness.  To him a career
in the navy is merely a stepping stone to loftier heights.<P>

<B>8 of Hearts</B> -- While his ambition is strong it is inconceivable that he would
ever use foul methods to further his ends.  He believes whole heatedly
in the tenements of the Confederation and realizes that violence is not
a desirable means to the end.<P>

<HR>

<h3>Grizelle, Amara</h3>
<B>Background:</b>  Amara is by far the oldest person aboard the Artemisia,
born before the collapse, Amara remembers a time when Imperial Starships
used to cross the skies of Ghost.  Though she is over 90 years old she�s
barely middle aged for a member of her species and appears to be little
more than 25 years old in human years.  Amara spent many years as a
member of the Illikarian Order and as one of the two hundred Inoshian
Guards.  In 1196 Ghost was contacted by a Stonehaven Merchant Vessel and
a diplomatic relationship was quickly established.  In accordance with a
treaty 100 Inoshian�s returned to Stonehaven to begin training at the
Stonehaven Underground Academy.  In 1200 Amara was posted to the
ill-fated Lakshimi Expedition where she lost the lower half of her right
arm at Scapa.  Though the arm was replaced by a prosthetic Amara still
has difficulties accepting the replacement.  She tends to keep it
covered by an arm length glove.  The arm is equipped with knuckle
razors.<P>

Amara Grizelle is an Elite NPC.<br>

</table>
<P>
<B>Queen of Hearts</B> -- The ships only crew member from Ghost, Amara is deeply in love
with Katyana Zenobia, a young woman from Mull.  While unaware that the
feeling is mutual Amara tries her hardest to be inconspicuous and
unobtrusive.  Amara would gladly lay down her life for Katyana and frets
about her constantly.<P>

<B>Ace of Clubs </B>-- Amara is a tactical genius on the ground, she has spent years
studying the art of war and quite possibly possesses one of Ghost�s
finest minds on the subject.  Unfortunately her tactical expertise is
confined solely to the ground.<P>

<HR>

<h3>Wayland, Marshal</h3>
<B>Background: </B> Born on Stonehaven in 1166 Marshal Wayland has been
involved in the human resistance since well before there even was a
human resistance.  Marshal has seen a lot in his time but none of it has
forced him to give up his basic beliefs in the goodness of humanity.  By
the time he was 17 Marshal had been blowing up can�s for a few years and
by the time the resistance organized in 1188 Marshal was already running
his own commando units.  In 1193 Marshal joined the Stonehaven Marine
Corps. just in time for the invasion of Aries and the liberation of
Mull.  Marshall saw heavy action in the Aries system with Marine ground
forces.<P>

</table>
<P>
<B>5 of Hearts</B> -- Marshal is a typical good egg with a strong sense of fellowship to
the crew of the Artemisia.  Marshal is something of a practical joker
and many a crew member has discovered this the hard way of previous
vessels.<P>

<B>10 of Clubs</B> -- Marshal, while generally an amicable fellow is more than capable
of violence.  Born on Stonehaven in one of the deep cities Marshal had
been fighting the cans long before the rebellion became organized.<P>

<HR>

<H3>Lynxara "Lynx" Mrranaa</h3>
<B>Background</B>:  In 1131 Lynxara was the senior sandcaster operator aboard
the Aslan warship Mrrini'Kapari "Devil's Claw".  At 29 she had risen
quickly through the ranks to attain a position of some authority.  In
1130 a major Aslan Ihetei fleet bound for Imperial border worlds in the
Nightrim Subsector.  Roughly halfway across Reavers Deep the fleet
became infected with the AI Virus, three-quarters of Lynxara's crew
mate's died when the ship opened it's airlocks defending itself from the
Aslan Engineers.  Lynxara and a number of her crewmates managed to pass
un-noticed through some of the more heavilly damaged sections of the
ship and arrive at the ships emergency lowberth facilities.  They
attempted for three more weeks to gain control of their ship and when
their food and oxygen supplies dropped to a critical level they were
finally forced to admit defeat.<P>

Eighty-seven years later the ship, heavilly damaged and unable to defend
itself limped into the Stonehaven system, where after a remarkably quick
engagement it was disabled and captured.  Lynxara and her crewmates were
quickly defrosted and offered positons within the Confederation's Navel
Service.  Lynxara accepted and was eventually posted to the Artemisia.<P>

  </table>
<P>
<B>7 of Clubs</B>-- Lynxara is both competant in her combat skills and not afraid to
use them when the time is right.  This is not to say she is a combat
monster, rather quite the opposite, due to her Aslan heritage Lynxara
views combat as a particularly male skill and like all Aslan females
uses it only when absolutely necessary.<P>

<B>Jack of Hearts</B> -- Because of her unique perspective on the nature of the universe
and her own postion there in Lynxara has become the ships official
confidant. Anytime any member of the ships crew has a problem they are
unable to solve they bring it to Lynxara and ask for her perspective. 
They understand that anything said will always be held in the strictest
of confidence and they have come to value her thoughts.<P>

<HR>

<h3>Jordan, Gabriel</h3>
<B>Background</B>:  Gabriel Jordan has always been something of a hood.  He
began his short career as a break in artist ripping off small valuable
pieces of military hardware.  However, he decided it would be much
easier to make money in his line of work if he could sell his
�acquisitions� to off world interests incapable of making the pieces
themselves.  To this end he joined the Navy and has been pilfering parts
ever since.<P>

Gabriel Jordan is an Experienced NPC<BR>

</table>
<P>
<B>Queen of Spades</B> -- Gabriel is fixated with the acquisition of wealth and nothing can
stand in his way of it.  There is nothing Gabriel won�t buy or sell
especially if there�s a profit to be made.  Gabriel has been known to
fill access panels in his service zone with contraband in an attempt to
make a little more money and woe be to the unlucky person who finds one
of his illicit stashes.  He doesn�t care how he makes money as long as
he accumulates lots of it.<P>

<B>9 of Diamonds </B>-- Greedy.  As mentioned before wealth is Gabriel�s primary
motivation.

<HR>

<H3>Zenobia, Katyana</h3>
<B>Background</B>:  Katyana is one of only a handful of collapse survivors from
the planet Mull.  Though she only recently joined the Stonehaven Navy,
Katyana has an instinctive grasp for all things mechanical (see below). 
Katyana�s skills on Mull were without parallel, she had a knack for
finding all the right parts and fixing the �unfixable.�  Both her
parents died accidentally several years ago and this was her primary
motivation for leaving Mull.<P>

Zenobia Katyana is an Elite NPC for panic; however she is a Green NPC
for skills except Mechanical for which she is Elite.

<TR><TD>Mechanic: 1196-1200         <TD>                     technical specialist<TR>
<TR><TD>Navy: 1201-                            <TD>          1 military<TR>
</table>
<P>
<B>Ace of Clubs</B >-- A survivor of the collapse at Mull, Katyana has an inherent grasp
of tactic�s, both space and ground.  It is uncertain where she attained
her skills but they are formidable indeed.  It is entirely possible that
Katyana�s tactical genius is what has attracted Amara to her.<P>

<B>Queen of Hearts </B>-- Katyana has strong feelings for Amara Grizelle while not sexual at
present Katyana is terribly attached to the �strange woman from Ghost.� 
Katyana never refers to Amara as a �Ghostie� and won�t tolerate others
referring to her in the same manner<P>

<HR>

Well that's my crew.  Don't think it wasn't lively keeping that crew
running on an even keel.  <P>

The PC's always respected the captians decissions, because she was
usually right.  Plus she was a fair and honest person, who took the
greatest care in ensuring her crew was not injured.<P>

They never did figure out who kept putting shaving cream in their boots.
They got into a huge bar fight after an intoxicated engineer refered to
Amara as a "Ghostie" and Katyana decked him.<P>

They grew to respect the abilities of the two marines who kept them safe
on hostile worlds, inspite of the fact one was so human and yet so
alien.<P>

Everyone immediately loved Barnett Yardley, because he was just so damn
personable,
and "Lynx" was always there for them when they needed advice.<P>

A number of these individuals were written up using my custom
Confederation of Nightrim career's.  I'll include those too.<P>
 

Some of you may be wondering why two of the for women on board are
involved with each other.  One of my PC's is an actor so he really gets
into things and loves to hit on women in the game.  I on the other hand
love to embarass him terribly.  So during the first session he
introduces him self to the Captian "Hellooooooooo Baaaaaaaby!!  You know
what I like!!!!"  Well needless to say he wasn't interested in the Aslan
woman so I had to jerk his mental chain somehow so I made the other two
women interested in each other and not him.  He still can't figure out
why they won't go out with him.  8)<P>
