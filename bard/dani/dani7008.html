<B>Communal Rationale:</B>  Offshoot of the Church of the Chosen Ones.
Combines previous lurid racialism with the depressed and downtrodden
state of the Post-Collapse Voudzeur Vargr to create a crusader or
warrior religion.
<P>
<B>God View:</B>  Deism:</B>  The Ancients no longer exist to be worshiped, and it
would probably seem unseemly to the Vargr to worship another alien
race anyway. Rather the Chosen Ones see their race as either the
perfect sentients, or in antebellum times as a project still in the
progress of self creation. (Writer's note:</B>  this latter view may
have been promoted by some of Grandfathers' robotic staff left to
keep an eye on the developing race. See Vilani & Vargr) The new church is rather
more confused on this issue, though the central leadership on
Igunfaksa holds to the harder lined fundamentalist notion that the
Vargr are perfect, except for occasional heresy that must be dealt
with by fire and iron, and that everyone else can go to hell if they
don't agree.
<P>
<B>Devotional:</B>  Programmatic. The Vargr were the chosen, period. All of
its efforts were channeled into proving that self-evident
superiority, though much argument existed about the methods and means
used. The Post-Collapse church is even more rigid, using various
pretexts to suppress any and all dissent within their turf, though
time and crisis has begun to dull them around the edges.
<P>
<B>Hierarchy:</B>  A mixture of various Religious Sovereigns and competing
Church/State systems. The Igunfaksa Ghorrnug is accepted as the chief
spiritual head, though local affairs are effectively out of his
prying control.
<P>
<B>Extremes:</B>  <BR>
<LI>A. Apollonian:</B>  Despite its heavy handed nature, the church
is unimaginative in stressing any other mysticism other than its self
evident mission to uplift the Vargr race into its exalted state.

<LI>B. Protean:</B>  To ensure control over its congregations, a mixture of
heavy handed apocalyptic theology is used to deaden the population
into lackadaisical fatalism
<LI>C. Render unto Ceaser:</B>  The COTCO has traditionally been a meddling
and intrusive religion. In this case the offshoot IS the government,
though not a cohesive enough one to really become a unified
interstellar state.
<LI>D. Mammon:</B>  Looting the losers has given way to fleecing the flock.
Heavy taxation and punitive tithes were originally intended to
prevent the development of competing commercial entities. They now
only enrich the hierarchy and its bureaucracy, with the Ghorrnug
being the most heavy handed of the bunch.
<LI>E. Inquisitor:</B>  No tolerance for slackers or heretics, the latter
being anyone who questions either the theology, or the corruption
that it supports. And these guys have refined a number of different
torture and execution techniques.
<LI>F. Augustine:</B>  COTCO is a one trick pony show, though it replays that
same routine over and over effectively.
<LI>G. Ares:</B>  Greed, both the worldly and the theological kind, motivates
the Post-Collapse church. But all they possess are a bunch of exalted
dung heaps. KILL THE INFIDELS AND LIBERATE THEIR VALUABLES.... I MEAN
THEIR VALUABLE SOULS FROM THE FIRES OF IGNORANCE!
<P>
<h3>Overview</h3>  The Church of the Chosen Ones is a dark mirror in which the
troubled Vargr soul is reflected. Theirs is the only major race to
have been uplifted from a non-intelligent species, and one that was
native to the homeworld of another major race. The fact that most of
their mannerisms are only a small step up from their ancestors (and
the fact that their ancestry lives on as the domesticated dog)
contributes to a slippery and thin racial identity. The fact that
humans, particularly Solomani, are very familiar with their
mannerisms and habits, while in turn the Vargr are dicomfitted by the
depth and power of human institutions and culture, often leads to
deep paranoia and suspicion among many Vargr states. And usually to
conflict with more ignorant human communities.
<P>
The Chosen Ones have many historical antecedents, but their history
begins with the Solomani Hypothesis. The revelation of the Vargr's
uplifting by the Ancients convinced many of them, perhaps too
euphorically, that their race had been singled out for special
treatment, perhaps as a master race over all other sophonts. A
theology that elevated the Vargr's racial superiority over their less
"manipulated" human neighbors was tonic for many hardpressed Vargr
populations, though as with many such movements, the fortune of the
church waxed and waned depending upon the warmth of relations between
the Imperium and its Vargr neighbors. The Church finds the bulk of
its recruitment efforts among less enlightened Vargr communities.
Many corsair bands and opportunistic or expansionistic states became
frequent partners of the Church, as its beliefs and theology were a
convenient justifier for their operations, provided that they were
concentrated upon bringing the faith to nearby sophonts and their
interstellar polities.
<P>
But as with most Vargr institutions, the Church was rife with
political challenge, internal dissent, ideological schism and
outright heresy. In the last five hundred years of its existence it
has been an institution in name only, with myriad congregations and
individual world hierarchies held together only by the common cause
of its theology, and even that is open to argument. For the most part
it moderated its theology away from self destructive racial supremacy
policies, though it skirted the line many times by its support of
Vargr corsair raids against the Imperium, and its advocacy for
powerful Vargr states and military expansion against the less noble
and heretical. The Taarskoerzn branch was the most radical, and had
significant historical and political influence. By 1116 it had
further hardened its message,  being influenced by the Oekhsos
tirades propagated by the Utovogh device. When word of Strephon's
assassination reached them, their priest whipped up the populace into
a frenzy, and the Glory of Taarskoerzn, which had been planning a war
with the Irrgh Manifest anyway, escalated their plans decisively.
<P>
Under the relenting assault by both Glory naval forces and a large
contingent of corsairs hired by their government, the Manifest forces
in their way were bullied or bludgeoned into submission. Within a few
short weeks the Taarskoerzn forces managed to humble their foes,
severing the Manifest into two halves separated by distance yet
united in their humiliation at their defeat. In recognition of their
foes superiority, the Manifest began to change its political and
military culture along similar lines. A few weeks after losing, the
surviving Manifest military in both sections launched an invasion at
opposite ends of the sector, piling on the already hard pressed
Imperial forces, and hastening their collapse. But an even more
decisive change was the adoption of the Taarskoerzn state religion,
the Church of the Chosen Ones, as the Manifest's own.
<P>
The advent of the Chosen Ones was quickened by the Irrgh's defeat.
Under their guidance, humiliation was transformed into a crusade of
vengeance against the body responsible:</B>  the Third Imperium. At the
urging of COTCO priests, the Manifest forces competed with their
rivals and neighbors to commit the most atrocities or collect the
most loot. By the time of the Collapse COTCO was so deeply enmeshed
in the politics of Voudzuer that they were able to sidestep the worst
effects of Virus and take over the power structures of many decimated
worlds. Both sections of the former Manifest are now dominated by
Post-Collapse factions of the Church, though Voudzeur contains groups
that are better organized and cohesive. So complete is the Church's
control that on many worlds the subsector name is no longer used,
being replaced simply with the term "Stars of the Chosen." Attempts
to change planetary names with church chosen appelations have been
less successful.
<P>
Takeover of these worlds was more difficult than the Church had
expected, however. Many surviving Manifest communities became
disenchanted with the Chosen One faith and attempted to either
abandon the faith, or expel their ministers from their territories.
The Church retaliated in an excessively cruel manner. They recruited
millions of troops from the outcasts and downtrodden survivors of
some Vampire raids, and through judicious discipline and offers of
land and security, managed to create a highly loyal shock force known
as the Kaedharz. Through the use of these troops the Chosen Ones
managed to purge "their" worlds of the heresy and blasphemy that
threatened them. On many their troops managed to equal or exceed the
atrocities inflicted by Virus. After about twenty years of genocidal
conflict, most of the worlds listed as "Mystic-" are under the
majority control of the church hierarchy. The main leaders are
located on the old Irrgh capitol of Igunfaksa (1431), with the
leadership of the other worlds declaring at least nominal loyalty to
the "Ghorrnug" or supreme leader of the Church.
<P>
The Church maintains several cloistered enclaves on the world it
controls. These are primarily city or county sized and fortified
against most forms of attack.  These are considerably more advanced
than the UPP codes otherwise indicate. For the most part the Church
has TL 10-12 production abilities, thanks to devoted salvage efforts,
and a significant stockpile of more advanced materials they ration
out when they are needed. All of these are equipped with their own
Class C or D starport, exclusively used by the Church and its
militia. The exception to this are B-class facilities on Igunfaksa
and Gheerg (1440), and on Khungorr/Uekhourg (1731). The starport on
Thoelksor (1331) is rumored to be a gift to its Chosen One friendly
leadership, as that world's technical guilds are largely dominated by
the Church, which has a large though low profile embassy that has
enormous influence over most of the world. It is worth noting that
the Stars of the Chosen One are a monastic feudal assemblage rather
than a functioning pocket empire:</B>  despite their pretensions its local
leaders are held together solely by mutual self-interest and rarely
ally above the planetary level except to save their scrawny necks
from greater threats.
<P>
The Church has a sizeable force of armed starships of less than 1000
tons displacement that it has managed to keep in service through
salvage and the hand making of hard to obtain spare parts. Its main
strength is its massive ground forces. The Kaedharz are divided into
four different echelons. The Oengkaedharz are the elite bodyguard
forces for Church leadership and facilities, and are always the most
fanatically loyal and given the best equipment available. The
Llokaedharz are commando and internal security strike forces that
eliminate dissension or heresy before it can spread out to infect the
rest of their congregants. The Sikaedharz are cadres placed within
the ranks of their main local and allied forces, but are given better
equipment and are used as both shock troops and religious
indoctrination personnel to maintain the loyalty of these forces. The
main bodies of local troops are known as the Soung, which in Aekhu
could mean "militia" but is better known in Gvegh as meaning "cannon
fodder" or "forlorn hope."  Most of these troops are well armed with
material of post-industrial levels or better, though the preferred
weapon of control are DEI Laser Weapons, given their devastating
effect upon large numbers of unarmored targets.
<P>
Most Wildside worlds are highly xenophobic, but under the Church's
baneful influence, local xenophobia is extremely dangerous. This is
due less to genuine hatred of unbelievers than the fact that even the
appearance of heresy with outside groups can trigger a bloody
intervention by the Kaedharz. Injunctions against outsiders are
enacted mostly for military and political reasons, since it isolates
rebellious elements within the subsector. Humans are particularly
loathed, and it is not uncommon for the leadership and Kaedharz to
lynch any humans that otherwise fall into their hands. This hatred of
the Imperium and all things humanity now seems largely pro forma and
contrived, and some worlds on the periphery of their territory are
inconsistent in this behavior.
<P>
Local congregation leaders are interested purely in secular gain, as
it is widely believed that the Imperium is completely dead, leaving
the faithful with the god-given opportunity to reclaim their
birthright, which is to rule the universe. Opposing this expansion
are the Tong of Kaasu, which is more powerful in space, and the
internal divisions of the Church itself. Two previous attempts to
invade Corridor have ended in absolute debacles, the last attempt
leading to the destruction of the Churchs remaining enclaves in
Uekhourg Subsector. Previously they allied themselves with a pair of
Vampire fleets opposed to the Tong, but the unreliability of these
allies and the Tongs last vehement reaction towards such covenants
has made the leadership more cautious. For the last thirty years it
has been collecting the materials and expertise necessary to rebuild
a major shipbuilding center located somewhere in the spinward
Windhorn. The level of construction is primitive, however, and
nothing more advanced than a few heavy TL-11 and light TL-12 warships
have been constructed. The size of the fleet is more worrisome, and
recalcitrant neighbors have been subjected to punitive vampire raids
of heavy warships in recent years they may turn out to be the so
called "Fleet of the Chosen Ones."
<P>
<B>COTCO Vessels:</B>  Roll 8+ for any world with a government code of 7 or
9. Roll 1D6+1 to determine the number of vessels present; if the
number is more than 3, all vessels beyond the first three are
non-jump capable craft such as SDBs, converted starships and armed
small craft. Vessel types should be determined randomly using charts
in TNE Rulebook or Referees Screen, though with the following
guideline:</B>  only one in three COTCO starships are military designs,
they are all Vargr designs, and only one out of twenty is a vessel of
more than 1000 tons displacement. All COTCO starship crews are
considered Line crews for purposes of skill determination. Wear value
of these vessels is usually between 4 and 8.
<P>
<B>COTCO Kaedharz:</B> </B> The Oengkaedharz are usually encountered only in the
presence of high church officialdom, in contingents of 1D6-1 times
200 personnel, and are always armed with weapons of the highest
available technology (TL 12-15); they are always of elite skills and
initiative. The Llokaedharz and Sikaedharz are primarily Veteran and
Experienced troops, constitute about ten to fifteen percent (half as
many on worlds where COTCO has enclaves but does not dominate) of
those militaries loyal or allied to the Church, and are always armed
at a level three points higher than local Soung forces (though never
lower than TL-7), and many are equipped with TL 8-10 DEI lasers for
"internal security purposes". Soung forces are always armed with
locally obtained resources, as their upkeep is the responsibility of
loyal feudal retainers.
