<UL><B>History</B>: 
<UL>Having completed my education and worked the necessary menial, 
fascilitating jobs to put life in perspective I am now on a 
sojourn	to learn about life, the universe and everything. I picked 
out a bunch of killer aloha shirts and bought an antique Hasselblad 
camera and am working my way accross the galaxy. I guess I'm too 
rich to realy know humble poverty but I endeavour to try to walk the path 
and be too sexy for my shirts.<BR><BR>
</UL>
<B>Contacts</B>:
<UL>Most of your contacts are back in the Hive Federation, but some of your
people and their advisors have come to the Reformation Coalition to help
lead the humans to a better path.  <BR><BR>

<B>Skl*a Sankctor</B>: Skl*a is an instructor at the marine training center on
Aubaine.  He instructs new human and schalli recruits in the use of high
tech weaponry and tactics.  You met him while walking the Tetramenous Path.
He is a fellow follower of the Path. He recently became enlightened.  He
is trying to help his trainees find their place in the universe.  <BR><BR>
