<UL><B>Background:</B>
   <UL>
Mother Superior Witherspoon is an imposing and forthright woman, even in her Order's white habit
with ornate gold & black trim. She considers her command of the 25,000 Disp jumpship <I>St. Degaaka
of Aladon</I> to be a trust from God, and is relentless in preserving that trust.
<P>
Born on Uakari, a backward world on the edge of the Quarrentine Zone, Witherspoon became a Catholic nun
at 12. Educated at Antra/Astra/Deneb, capital of the subsector, she became a doctor at the Free University of Immin Shishadiim and joined the Order of Holy
Succor, a medical order.
<P>
As a member of that order, she was posted to <I>St. Degaaka of Aladon</I>, a medical/convent jumpship.
With a crew of 130, the 73-year old ship is equipped to TL D standards, with 700 beds and medical
facilities to match.
<P>
Sister Witherspoon was only elevated to Mother Superior two years ago, and her hands-on style
conflicts with the administration & bureaucratic needs of the convent. Moreover, she has only limited
leadership qualities, tending to ram her way through problems and expecting that everyone will
automatically do her duty, scolding those who don't meet her detailed standards.
<P>
Currently the <I>St. Degaaka of Aladon</I>is posted to Plankwell Subsector, a backward subsector troubled by
Aslan/Human conflicts. The <I>St. Degaaka</I> is desprately needed here, as so many systems have no
access to TL D+ medical care. But money is tight and Collace/Plankwell/Spinward Marches, the only port that can repair the aging <I>St. Degaaka</I>, is
harrasing the convent to please the Aslans, who oppose a Regency hospital ship in the subsector.
