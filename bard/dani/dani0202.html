   <UL>Kircher's parents were both killed in food 
     riots in the early 70's. He was assigned to state 
     run orphanage. Here he learned that he had to be 
     strong to survive, any sign of weakness was seized 
     by the other orphans. At eighteen he was turned 
     loose, after a few months of wandering, he joined 
     the Marines. Here he found an outlet for his 
     violent tendencies. In fact the Marines encouraged 
     them. He was commissioned and after distinguishing 
     himself on an assault on a Raider's base deep in 
     the Oort Cloud, he was offered a position in the 
     THIRD. He jumped at the chance.  He served with 
     distinction, gathering a Purple Heart in the 
     assault on Spencer. </UL>
