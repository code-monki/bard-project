<UL><B>Background:</B>
   <UL>

   Eleven years before he was born, his homeworld, Vume/Sindal/Trojan Reach was conquered without a fight by the Regency. In
   return for a formal acceptance of the Regent as their Liege, the now-defunct nations of Vume were
   ennobled, then swamped by the waves of settlement from nearby Albe.
   <P>
   By the time Alco was 10, the original population of 10,000 had risen to over 1 million, with the old
   Vume culture forgotten by all but the museums. Seeing how Regency Nobility was losing power,
   Alco's elders made him join the Regency Electorial Office, to get a firsthand feel of the New
   Democracy - and see how the Vume families can cut a niche in it.
   <P>
   Alco himself has no love for politics, and privately detests both his elder's controlling ways and their
   willingness to sell their heritage for titles. He hopes to prevent Mewey/Five Sisters/Spinward Marches - another world `persuaded'
   to join the Regency, in 1182 - from Vume's fate by the vigourous defense of Mewey's democratic
   right's. Indeed, his superiors wonder if sometimes Mr. Alco places Mewey's interest's above the
   Regency's.

<P>
   No Family on Mewey : but a large, wealthy, and controlling one on Vume. Son of an Hereditary Baron, but not in the line of succession)

<UL><B>Appearance:</B>
   <UL>Of Solomani decent: white, with brown hair w/mustache set on a slim face. Tends to project a neat,
`natty' aura. Dresses in typical "minor noble" fashion, on the conservative side.
 </UL>

<UL><B>Personality:</B>
   <UL>Soft-spoken, even timid, but rigid if a matter of principle is involved. Is quietly europhic over getting
away from his family, but nervous about doing something stupid and ending his new-found freedom.
Enjoys going on `walkies' on Mewey, the first world he's ever been on where you can step outside,
breathe the air, and feel the sunshine gently lie on his shoulders.
