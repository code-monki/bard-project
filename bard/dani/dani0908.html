<UL><B>History:</B> 
<UL>
Longstreet is most interested in promoting the Federalist cause,
as this is what will ensure the Freedom of the Spiri. Like most Spiri, and
especially members of the Great Houses, he is not especially interested
in personal gain or creature comforts, but will invest most of his
gains in medical training of Spiri in Outworld Universities and
Federalist political parties in other worlds.<BR><BR>

His immediate goals are to accumulate wealth and to learn more about
Federalist parties in outworlds (i.e., which are the worthy causes to
which he can donate). He will quickly contact Spiri who have
assimilated into outworld society (possibly even the Spiri
representatives in the Reformation Coalition), who would, because of
his social status, assist him in choosing the best places to invest his
money. To reciprocate he would be their spirit guide and would assist
them in developing higher meditative consciousness. He spends most of
his spare time either in meditation or in research of contemporary
politics or into various sources related to the Lost Continent.<BR><BR>

Longstreet, like many members of the Great Houses, is a vegetarian.
So far he has not revealed his abilities to the rest of the crew of the
Argo.  He understands that he might someday have to let them know about
his psionic talents, but he wants to get to know them better before he
does.  See has decided to invest his money in stocks, 25% in Standard
Astronics and 75% in Dugan & Delgado stocks. He feels that both of these
companies share his politics, and will make money.<BR><BR>

<UL><B>Contacts:</B>
<UL><B>Rutherford B. See</B> is a first cousin from your mother's brother.  He is a few
years older than you and as children he often lead you and your other friends
on wild adventures. On the few times you got caught, he took the blame, saving
you from serious trouble.  He is a very happy person, with a great sense of 
humour.  He is a powerful telepath, a few years ago he decided that he could
put his gifts to better use in the Wilds, so he joined the RCES.  So far
they have used him as an undercover operative, where his telepathy can be
used to ferret out secrets that ordinary agents couldn't get to.  He has
come home once since joining up.  He told you of his many adventures, but 
you think he might have made up one or two of the stories, especially the 
one about the four sisters on Yontz. You don't know where he is serving 
right now, but you are sure he is helping make the future a better place.<BR><BR>
														   
<B>Telea Drachinloch</B> was a fellow student at the Academy.  You met in an
advanced philosphy class.  After graduating, she decided to stay on to
work on an advanced degree in history.  She later became a faculty member 
at the University of Gwynmark, which is probably the second best
school on the planet. (Behind the Academy of course)  When Spires was
contacted by the RC, she got offworld, in a program to exchange faculty 
members with off world universities.  Every six months the faculty members
rotate to a new school.  You think she is at the University of Dunkirk on
Nike Nimbus, but you aren't sure.<BR><BR>

<UL><B>Information:</B>
<UL>When you were competing in the Contest, you heard several of the other
contestants talking about a rumour they had heard.  They were convinced that
Aubaine had created a great spy network throughout the RC.  The spies are
on every planet, and are charged with making sure that everyone is dedicated
to the RC.  They also steal information that allows Aubaine to maintain its
dominance in the Coalition, both technological and political.  A few days
later, the woman who started the conversation died in a freak accident in
the Contest.  Deaths in the Contest aren't unknown, but they are rare.  
You don't know if it was all a strange coincidence, or something else.  <BR><BR>

You have recently heard of a new group named the Templars. They are a fighting
order dedicated to killing Vampire ships and Virus infested computers.  They
will accept anyone who is willing to live by their rules. They do not care
about past crimes or mistakes.  They live under strict discipline and 
constantly practice weapon skills.  A pair of recruiters came to Spires a few
months ago, but they only managed to recruit a few people.  The pair said
that they have a secret base somewhere in nearby space, where they train for
battle.  They will not release the location of the base, in case there are
agents of the Vampires in the area.  The pair also spoke of a great fleet
of Vampires that is gathering, and only by relentless vigilence will human
space be preserved.  They seemed very sincere, and very dedicated.<BR><BR>
