<UL><B>Background:</B>
   <UL>Who am I? The name on my ID says Hans Pritcher. The face 
matches mine. I have no memories except in my nightmares.  In 
them it is very cold and there is no gravity. Each one reveals 
more of my identity. Even though they terrorize me, I find myself 
wanting them so that I can end this wakeful death.  When I am 
awake all I know are two names and faces. Bj Eyzaguirre and Ammel 
Brodrig.  The first to deliver a message to, the second to kill. 
Of course I can't remember what the message is. <P>

I know that I am somehow enhanced. I can see in the dark, others 
can not.  I have been unscathed by bullets that penetrate others. 
I know that I am somehow more/less than human.  I feel nothing 
except in the flashbacks. <P>

Pritcher is an enigma even to himself.  He thinks he might be 
some sort of artifical construct, android, cyborg, or 
bio-construct he doesn't know, and deep down he doesn't really 
want to know.  While he tries to figure out the question of his 
existance, he has taken up a job working as a corporate trouble 
shooter. With the emphasis on shooting.  After killing a man on 
the job, he relized that he had killed before, and fairly often. 
Another piece of the puzzle.</UL>

<UL><B>Appearance:</B>
   <UL>Pritcher is of average height and build. He has dark hair, 
and he wears it slicked back. His face hardly ever shows any 
emotion, and he often wears sunglasses to hide what he is looking 
at. He tends to wear long coats, to better hide the numerous 
handguns he tends to carry.</UL>
</UL>
<UL><B>Personality:</B>
   <UL>Pritcher is a very violent man, but in a controlled
manner.  He will not attack people unless there is a purpose to
it.  He is willing to break the law, if compensated well enough.  He
will try to find an organization which needs his talents, and
which will reward him with significant amounts of cash. </UL>
