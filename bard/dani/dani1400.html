<UL><B>Background:</B>
   <UL>

   <P>   Werner von Kessel was born in 1082, on Vaward (1106/Quinoid/Old
Expanses [then- A-795A99-F N Hi In Cx 102 Im], the son of a high-ranking
Navy Officer (His father, Ulrich retired in 1110 a RAdmiral, with thirty-two
years of service). He graduated from the Imperial Navy Flt Academy with
Honors, valedictorian of his class in 1113.
    <P>   He was first assigned to the system defense squadrons of
Depot/Ultraneta system in the Old Expanses in 1114, and was there when the
Solomani invaded the Old expanses in 1117, after Emperor Lucan had withdrawn
the OPFOR fleet from here, along with the rest of the High tech Imperial Old
Expanses Fleet for the meat grinder battles in Zarushagar versus Dulinor's
"Loyal" Fleet. He was reassigned to a picket duty Destroyer Escort insystem
when the Solomani offensive gathered steam and took the system in 1118, and
managed to inflict casualties upon the invaders, and jump out after his ship
was rendered nearly battle ineffective upon the death of his Captain. At
Vaward, he was reassigned in 1119 to a Light Cruiser, and served as the
weapons officer aboard her, and participated in the retaking of the Depot
system in a lightning raid that caught the Solomani fleet with their
proverbial pants down, and managed to save the base facilities from
scuttling. This action earned him a second wound badge, and the Meritorious
Conduct under Fire Imperial medal (MCUF).
      <P>       In a 1122 he was given his own command at last, a
Khugelikaer-class Destroyer, and was part of the counteroffensive that drove
the Solomani back into the lower Older Expanses sector, and wound up by 1125
in command of a Lt. Cruiser squadron out of Vaward with a promotion. From
1126-1130 CPT Kessel was in charge of a Hunter-Killer squadron, consisting
of an S-class (Shaker weapon equipped) Planet-class CA, the ISS Vaward, and
four Aganar-class Light cruisers, and their 12 close escorts & scouts. Their
mission was to patrol the Outlands, and destroy/stop/capture Lucan's Black
war ships, ironically the very squadrons, like CDRE Eshraa bint Reine was
operating into the Old expanses with (Her raid in 1127 destroyed Berkin's
navy base and starport).
       <P>    The ISS Vaward suffered battle damage and misjumped in 1130
(partly from Virus infection). The CG was knocked out and this saved many of
the crew from "Grav-pong", but she was adrift, and the system was Sovtor,
which had been extinguished a week prior. Some of the crew elected to stay;
others took subcraft and headed for the main world, never to be seen again.
Fortunately the Black globe generator's HPG aboard was utilized as a solar
array and kept minimum power running as they orbited the primary star.
       <P>      Von Kessel's men drew lots, and some 187 went into low berths,
and a watch was set. At least four or five would remain awake two weeks at a
time, until they were rescued. He suspected some sort of AI Virus had been
unleashed (rumors of Lucan & Dulinor's fleets final clash in Core 179-1130
were known to him, the whereabouts of the other ships of the squadron were
not), and so trusted not in restoring full power, even though they had fuel
for a J-4 remaining. Several hundred crewman had been blown out the airlocks
already, and half the subcraft were gone with another 200. The dead from the
previous battle (with a vampire ship, unbeknownst to them) were buried in
space on a one-way trip to the star, as per regulations. Then they waited.
   <P>     It was in 1188 when the guild raider "Enemy of God, Mercy & Pity", a
Nishemani- (P) class Corsair ship discovered them, and docked with 36
personnel aboard, looking for loot and salvage. The raping was underway of
newly awakened personnel when Kessel, D'Estoc, Castle, and Novanya
discovered they were no longer alone. They killed the rapists, and boarded
the vessel, killing the crew remaining aboard, undocked her, and re-docked
on a secure part of the ship only the officers could access--the engineering
section.
     <P>    Dr Novanya awoke several Marines, and they routed the remaining
Pirates. They were spaced, after a courts-martial, as per Imperial Navy
Interstellar law. Due to their taking the ship, they recovered the Guild's
astrogation database, and what lay nearby.  They risked awakening a few more
personnel, and jumped to nearby Solee and placed themselves at the mercy of
the Soleean Navy, headed up at that time in 1188 by then CDRE Gabriela
Ramstattan, and several dozen Lucan remnants, including Eshraa Bint Reine, a
Black War Sqdn commander that von Kessel had hunted before.
  <P>     Ramstattan gave the approval for the rescue, and the Light cruiser
ISS Lord Imperial was dispatched with medical personnel and low berths to
affect rescue. Four weeks later, the ISS Vaward was jumped one parsec to
Solee for refit and repair, and the Imperial remnants of Margaret's Navy
were integrated into the Soleean Navy.  CDRE Ramstattan immediately set the
187 survivors into leadership cadre positions over her nascent space Navy
forces personnel (at that time some 9,000 personnel), and began
refurbishment of the Imperial Navy Base facilities dirtside, and upgrading
it to a C-class port (both accomplished by 001-1192). Margaret's personnel
being lower echelon NCOs and officers save for a handful under von Kessel
utilized the ISS Vaward as a training vessel and monitor in this time
period.
      <P>   The unification of the system of Solee and merging with the
economic Polity of the Democratic Accord of Galines worlds in 1189-90
created a new "empire" of sorts, following the path of Margaret's Dream, the
re-expansion into the wilds. Many of the SDB's Solee possessed were utilized
in the new "Alliance" as battle riders for convoy security.  With the
establishment of the C-class yard and formal alliances with the DAG polity
in Jayna, Solee's Empress Gabriela turned over control of the fleet to Admiral
Eshraa bint Reine. CPT von Kessel was assigned to Galines to take control
and organize the reclamation of military vessels there as part of the "3 to
1" policy in 1193. With the anti-virus treatments Solee developed in this
time period, coupled with quantum computer advances made by Virus busters
from the DAG world of Czerniak, von Kessel helped organize and indoctrinate
the defensive Non-jump fleets of Thanatos, Czerniak, and Galines. By 1198,
(including the ISS Vaward, now the ISS Solee), the Jayna "fleet" consisted
of 5 major jump warships and fifteen smaller starships (some of which were
captured Guild corsair vessels). For his efforts he was knighted in 1194,
but not promoted.
   <P>     Von Kessel saw his personnel scattered, but employed in decent
posts, several, like his former weapons officer, Jules D' Estoc promoted to
command a vessel of their own. Admiral bint Reine however, saw to it that
Soleean Imperial Securitat had a monitoring agent aboard the Soleean ships
(ala the Commissar system of certain Totalitarian regimes of old Terra, and
the IMOJ during Lucan's reign), including Von Kessel, whom she disliked for
personal reasons. Many of Von Kessel's people were from the engineering
department on the Vaward/Solee and a few key personnel he was able to keep,
if only to keep the vessel running. Spare parts were a problem, and the
relic fleet being refurbished from 1196 onward in orbit over Solee was a
finite resource. It totaled nearly 200 vessels (some 48 Major ships & 144
smaller ones), but if cannibalized down to hulls, Solee would be unable to
sustain her "fleet" for no more than two decades, that and they were of
mixed tech levels from both Imperial and Solomani sources. Solee needed the
Depot system, von Kessel knew, so Spring of 1199, they struck, and defeated
a Vampire force insystem, and captured the system after making an alliance
with the "peaceful" AI-guardians of the Automated (project Vulcan)
shipyards, and the mothball fleet that still held ships of TL-11 thru TL-9,
and a few of TL-12 thru 14.
 <P>   Due to the nature of the agreement reached by von Kessel, and the gains
made thereof (the reproduction of Starship Hull forming machinery, and
Jump-drive machinery by D-Yard (a benevolent Hobbyist strain), allowed the
starports of Galines, Thanatos, Czerniak, and Solee to be upgraded by
1200-01. The Empress promoted Von Kessel to CDRE for this action in the
autumn of 1199.
 <P>    Czerniak's tech level of TL-11, and her B-class starport went to
A-class in 180-1200; Galines' C-class port became B-class also by 365-1200.
Solee's C-class starport achieved a B-class rating by 001-1202, due to
expenses incurred in the 1198-99 Hindahl/ Marcena campaigns; and Thanatos'
small port became B-class and tech restored to TL-9 by 001-1201.
    <P>   Depot itself became the HQ for the "Jayna Fleet" of CDRE von Kessel,
with another 12 SDB's for insystem defense, and a Starburst Light Cruiser
captured (the head of the puppeteer "fleet" defeated by his task force in
1199). Between the summer of 1199 and Fall of 1200, some 1 million personnel
from Czerniak, Galines, Thanatos, and Solee were employed there to start the
refurbishment and self-sustaining nature of the base (Hull alloys mined from
asteroids by Belters from Thanatos; Ship maintenance by personnel from
Czerniak, Galines, and Solee's former C-class yards; as well as a garrison
of Star Marines from Galines and Solee. In this latter amount of personnel,
Czerniak did not participate, being defensive minded, and saving her forces
for her own system's defense. The other two planets did not object to this
policy, as Czerniak was the tech giant of the three at TL-11).
   <P>       Von Kessel spent the next two years (1200-1201) further
co-coordinating and training this new Soleean Imperial Navy in Jayna
subsector. Linnert was opened as an R & R facility for the Depot personnel,
who were stringently placed on 20-year contracts, and recruited for having
no family connections some grumbled, but the pay at Depot was better than
their homeworld' s ports, for all the secrecy.
   <P>     Then the news of the capture of the RCS Marathon Victrix arrived in
early 1202, just as Von Kessel was preparing to explore rumors from a free
trader on the worlds of Kestral corewards of Depot and Montero, both
boasting B-class ports, but at war with each other. As Margaret's Dream
(reversed) policy dictated a re-expansion/ recontacting worlds of the Wilds,
von Kessel knew the Soleean Admiralty would not back him (headed by Bint
Reine) unless he succeeded beyond the victory achieved at Depot. The
charismatic policies of the navy under (now) Empress Ramstattan left no room
for defeat, success meant everything. Admiral bint Reine was gearing up to crush
what had been ill-timed 1198-99 on Marcena and Hindahl in 1202, readying the
Soleean navy for its new foe to rimward, the "Reformed Coalition", so any
assets needed would be minimal. But von Kessel had cut his teeth in Hard
Times 1125-30 making the most of what little he'd been given then.
  <P>    Utilizing the same strategy as before, the ISS Solee grappled several
non-jump SDBs and two smaller escorts, entered into Kestral' s system, in
early 1202, and made contact with the Theocracy of Kestral, and the
Galanglic Thrice Reformed Catholic church headed up by Cardinal Margaera de
Messina. It was no small effort towards the results he gained that he
himself was a practioner of that faith, and gained audience with her
Imminence.  If Solee's Empress would recognize her Cardinalship, she would
recognize Solee's sovereignty & empire, as long as Montero was defeated, and
the heretic Patriarch was displaced. The Guild's part in this 20 odd year
"Heresy" war of divisiveness was revealed by the Soleeans allies from
Czerniak, who'd also scouted the coreward main of Jayna-Quinoid. Von Kessel
dispatched a Jump 4 patrol cruiser to speed word to Solee & the Empress, and
prayed for the best.
<P>    Eight weeks later, even as the "Marathon-Victrix" incident was fresh on
the headlines of Galines, Czerniak, and Solee, the ISS Solee bore her
Imperial Majesty Solee to Kestral, arriving on 08 /III/1202. Her Imperial
Majesty Solee, Gabriela Ramstattan did recognize Matriarch-Princess Margaera
' s claims, live on Kestral TV and radio to the world and the Kestral Royal
Fleet. In return, for the fealty to the empire, Matriarch-Princess Margaera
vowed her fleet (with Admiral Von Kessel's Naval forces' assistance to move
1parsec coreward) to reclaim Montero & her rightful place as The GTRC's
rightful Leader of both Quinoid and Jayna subsectors.
The Monteran fleet, while numerous, had been badly led, men of high piety
not sound tactical sense had captained her. Another flaw in their thinking,
they never dreamed of being on the defensive. As a result, the Monteran navy
lost well over a third of her vessels, and all of her Jump capable ships had
been captured. Princess Margaera was magnanimous in Victory to the defeated
Navy, "recant the election heresy and be free, or be excommunicated out an
airlock". Superior ship's sensors, and missiles (TL-11 from CZRNIAK versus
TL-9 sensors and missiles), as well as a commander willing to take risks,
proved to be the "Holy Crusader Fleet's" undoing. The ISS Solee did suffer a
few hits herself, and was laid up until June of 1202 here for repairs,
allowing the Soleeans and Kestralians to capture the returning starships
from their missionary work. The rest of the "Jayna" star fleet he dispatched
back to Depot, after conducting limited contact operations with the
Matriarch to Paragon, Kase, Issek, Leome, Trevor, Darius, Fezzan, and
Palique to soothe over the War of the Heresy's subsector fallout.
     <P>         Von Kessel was promoted to Admiralin May of 1202, now he
highest-ranking former Margaret's Navy remnant in the Soleean Navy. Solee's
"empire" now stretched from the rim of Quinoid subsector B through Jayna,
and into Shenk. Once repairs to the ISS Solee were finished at Montero in
June, he undertook for the Powerful techno-logical world of Czerniak a
mission into the Syrs subsector. He left Solee's two new Systems to the
administration of the diplomats from Czerniak & Galines for routing
Tukera-Hapsburg Lines (TKHL), LIC traffic their direction. A small cadre of
his officers was left emplaced to head up the new Navies, and make the
repairs necessary from the battle.
 <P>   First, Sarcathon, which Czerniak had contacted and wished to include in
the vision of "Margaret's dream"; J-3 to spinward from her; then Exage, site
of a former hi-tech Naval base belonging to the Imperial 197th fleet/1197th
Reserve fleet; J-4 rimwards from Exage lay Syrs, former subsector capital,
also like Exage, formerly TL-15; and last, the TED of Yerhen, J-3 to
trailing from Syrs, back towards Czerniak.
<P>    It seemed to Admiral Von Kessel's enemies back on Solee in the Admiralty
(namely the jealous former Lucan remnants, including Admiral Eshraa bint Reine &
jealous Soleean Native commanders) his string of successes had no end. The
Syrs expedition would prove that even Von Kessel's gunboat diplomacy and
heralding Margaret's Dream" would have its nay- Sayers, and some TEDs who'd
be less than impressed with Solee's claim as her heirs. Unbeknownst to Lt.
General Otto Adraskaar, head of Soleean Imperial Securitat (SIS), Von Kessel
had seduced his personal SIS commissar, and she was falsifying reports on
his "political correctness".
 <P>   The Commonwealth of Sarcathon, a high gravity cored world, was
agriculturally poor, but had gone from being a mere company owned mining
world to a TL-8 industrial world during the collapse. Her former C-class
orbital port was a ruin, a shadow of its former self, but tech decline from
TL-9 had not been a hard fall. The population had replaced the corporate
board with a civil service bureaucratic Govern-ment. Sarcathon had become,
like Mueller of Shenk subsector had been, a haven for Free Traders, save
here, and they WERE the government! Sarcathon' s Commonwealth had a small
space force, some 4 large ships, and 12 smaller ones.  Of these large ships,
5 were Spear-class Monitors (TL-9, 1ktn, NJ/1G), purchased in prewar days a
sustainable SDB's for the system. Her one large jump-capable ship was a
marooned Chauncy Smith-class Bulk freighter (TL-10, 10ktn, J-1/1G) the SS
Clersor-Clipper, is the flagship for her mercantile commonwealth. Sarcathon'
s other ships include 8 Lancet-class SDB's (TL-9, 200dtns, NJ/1G), and her
four smaller Jump ships are A
Shambalator-class Close Escort (TL-15, 600dtns, J2/3G)SS Ulysses, Two armed
Petty-class freighters (TL-10, 400dtns, J1/1G),  the SS Black Nile's
Daughter, & SS Capricorn's Caprice, and a Wilds Trader-freighter (TL-12,
800dtns, J3/2G), SS Siobhan's Starduster.
  <P>      Their ships  traveled as far as the E-class port on Ranb (0311/
E-766788-6 Ag D: 2 802)), where the former colony of Dachnis' folk had
centralized things in a Socialist Totalitarian state, to the E-class port on
Babellet (0412/ E-757668-5 Ag Ni B104), an agrarian world run by fairly
benevolent TEDs. Ranb was no longer on their itinerary since they had nearly
lost a ship there five years ago, thanks to the Guild putting ideas into the
Ranb-Soviet's minds. Most of their trade was conducted with the desert world
of Vinhooks (0613/ X-440420-5 De Lo Ni 203), the Vilani-style Impersonal
Bureau of pre-industrial Afrend (0614/X-6768BB-3 801 ), and the pre-stellar
industrial world of Ilm (0715/X-6628CA-5  315). Sarcathon was willing to
join the empire, but had little to contribute to any "fleet" efforts.
Czerniak's diplomats assured them they could have their C-class starport
rebuilt within two years, and a market for their TL-8 goods, especially
military ones, to trailing was in demand (Mostly to those few TL-6 "client
states" that had acknowledged "the will of Solee"). Czerniak had opened a
colony/ salvage world on Rebields (1708/ Jayna) six years ago, and a second
on Inftow (1607/Syrs) in 1200.  J-1 Trade with Yerhen and J-2 trade from
Sarcathon would greatly ease burdens (costs to keep supplied in food and
materials) on both. In return, TL-9 parts and machinery from Galines and
Solee carried on TKHL transports would tie them into the "empire".  Homage
to Empress Ramstattan, and the protection of the Solee Imperial fleet were
small prices to pay. As if to quell doubts, representatives from Czerniak's
version of Ling Standard products arrived two weeks after  Admiral Von Kessel,
and relinquished their holdings to the "Commonwealth of Sarcathon"  (purely
a political fait d' accompli), and the two freighters she arrived with
brought spare parts for their aging Spear class monitors & Lancet SDB's.
The Sarcathians looked at this with both a sigh of relief (now they didn't
have to do all of this "foreign" aide alone) and since guarantees were made
on the autonomy of their system itself, and the Soleeans seemed to mean
business and keeping their end up, the vote was barely contested. By August
1202, construction crews from Czerniak began to arrive to facilitate the
creation of an orbital C-class port. It was half completed by December 20th,
thanks in part to its modular construction.
<P>    The talks to include Sarcathon were wrapped up by the end of June, and
in the first week of July, the ISS Margaret's Dream and four small escorts
entered the Exage system. No trace of the former orbital Naval yards
existed. A balkanized world of 23 nations before the war of some 2 billion
sentients, the Final War and Solomani & Imperial warring over the system had
done nothing good for them. War had come to Exage in 1117 and had not left
it yet. His two-day survey from orbit revealed a lot gleaned from various TV
and radio traffic. Of the 23 nations, only 20 existed. The three largest had
become a post apocalyptic wasteland for nomadic bandits, the exiled, and
outlaws. "A dog-eat-dog world, and everyone's been out of biscuits for
eighty-five years," he wrote in his memoirs.
 <P>   On the third day, they were hailed by ships from the captured planet of
Osage (orbit 3.6), and found themselves being questioned by a relic fleet,
some Solomani, some Imperial that hailed back to the 1197th reserve fleet to
be friendly or hostile. Admiralvon Kessel kept his composure, and his wits--he
was outgunned and out maneuvered by a relic 50ktn Crusader-class cruiser, as
well a several large warships, and a host of fighters bearing missiles. He
discovered the Pocket-empire-within the Exage system of "Osagi Intersystem
Co-Dominion", a Charismatic Dictatorship government resembling that of
Solee's, with a Bwap run civil service bureau running the bureaucracy behind
it. Von Kessel was "invited" to Osage, a captured near twin of Exage within
the habitable zone (orbit 3.6). Here, Von Kessel met with another survivor
of low berthing, the aging charismatic commander of the Famed "Silver
Shadows" squadron that resisted the Solomani fleet for four months, CDRE
Alamandraa Dupree (ret.). She was intrigued by the knowledge of Solee's
expansion, and survival. The Megacorporations representatives with him, from
Czerniak & Galines were pleased to see Osage had maintained a B-class
starport within the system itself. Dupree was canny though, and wanted to
know to what benefit would the Osagi have in "joining up with the "Empire of
Solee"? Osage had been a colony of the Exage, as had Corsage in orbit 4, and
the worlds around the two large gas giants Mesopotamia & Peleponnesia. Osage
had written off their homeworld a long time ago, and concentrated instead on
managing the worlds of her own system, though they had established outposts
in the adjacent Technologically backward system of Frallsford (TL-0) and
dead world system of Bede to monitor possible Guild and Vampire traffic.
<P>    By this time in 1202, the Osagi had made client states out of their gas
giant system worlds of Azarmeiid & Athens, formerly Guild strongholds, and
the Guild was bending over backwards (inverted in most cases) to be allowed
to continue to trade within the system. Most of the Guild's treachery and
guile had failed, and several Guilds ships had fallen prey to the Osagi
Navy. Only those with legitimate cargoes and business dared come her now, as
well as a few Free Traders from Sarcathon, or from Ephraim out in Pasdaruu
subsector in Diaspora. Like the Soleeans, the Osagi had used the carrot and
stick approach in dealing with TEDs here, co-opting them if they proved
reliable, and ruthlessly replacing them if they did not "play well with the
Osagi". What Von Kessel did not know was that the Osagi had re-invented the
Jump-0 engine back at TL-9 (Osage re-achieved TL-10 in 1201), and had
swiftly dominated in system traffic since then. Their major expenses were
maintaining the standard jump-drives of their Starships, and the ships
themselves. The Soleeans were impressed at the level of organization, and
envious of their "fleet". Osage had moved with Vilani deliberate lack of
haste and planning, and was thus in better shape than Solee in 1201. Further
expansion along the main was hemmed in by the presence of vampire ships in
the Strat & Ajjeig systems. In the case of the former system, the Osagi Navy
had run several sorties and reconnaissance missions already and assessed
their threat. The problem came in fetching back what they intended to
capture.
 <P>   The Czerniak CIA telepath assigned to Admiral Von Kessel's staff discerned
these details when discussing the needs of the Osagi (or apparent lack
thereof) in joining the Soleean Empire, and later made these findings known
when the Soleeans conferenced back aboard their ship. Several Soleean
officers were racially opposed to the presence of the Bwap bureaucrats, but
Von Kessel silenced them--they were Imperial citizens, and performed their
functions well. Solee Nationalism aside, anti-Alien bigotry had no place in
diplomacy with such an asset as what Osage presented to them. CDRE Dupree's
granddaughter was their new leader, but her grandmother still influenced the
nation. Without their alliance with the Bwap, they might have fallen into
the anarchy that was Exage, he argued. The Czerniak diplomats approved, as
they had made separate agreements with the Droyne in Jayna upon Sveinel,
contrary to the Human Supremacists of Galines and Solee. The discussion did
not go unremarked by those officers that felt Von Kessel was "politically
incorrect".
 <P>   When they returned to the talks two days later, Von Kessel laid out the
outline of the audacious diplomatic venture to the Osagi. Solee was
expanding back into space. They were the dominant force in Jayna Subsector,
and extending into Shenk. They were extending the hand of friendship, and
trade with Czerniak via a proposed J-3 route through Yerhen, Sarcathon to
here, with a J-4 feeder line between Syrs and the Exage system. This was a
bold move to lay out the cards, as it were, for they'd not yet contacted
Syrs or dealt with Yerhen' s TED yet. Solee had anti-virus detection,
elimination, and prevention technology they offered in trade. Galines &
Czerniak had the freighters to make the trade route a reality, Czerniak had
tech -11 computers, software, missiles, and manufactured goods that would
aid in Osage's recovery. His last trump, they had captured the Imperial
Depot from Virus, and had a wealth in spare parts for Osage's navy--if they
were part of the new Empire! Osage had the J-0 engine for deep system
travel, and a sizeable fleet. Between the Merchants of Sarcathon and the
Osagi, they could bring civilization back to the Syrs subsector in a matter
of decades, or they could join Solee, and accomplish the same in a matter of
a few years. The Osagi Navy would be responsible for securing the terminals
of the Trade route. They would keep their own leadership, of course, and
enjoy the benefits of alliance. Czerniak also offered them assistance in
opening up recovery-worlds for salvage; they had opened two, Rebields/Jayna
in 1200, Von Kessel made no mention of what would happen if they did not
agree, as it would have been impolitic (and dangerous, since his vessels
were at their mercy). The Osagi went back to conference among themselves.
The Osagi however favored the match up, but were a lot more skeptical than
even Von Kessel imagined.
 <P>   They demanded their major ships get their jump drives repaired, and that
they conduct joint operations together. The Osagi mentioned the Vampire
ships trapped in Strat & Ajjeig systems as a first opportunity to measure up
their prospective allies claims.  He dispatched one of his escorts Back to
Czerniak to send word for the ISS Solee, his flagship of the Jayna Fleet,
and for the Czerniak system Navy to provide as many Les Torpeilleur -class
Missile boats as they could spare. In the meantime, Von Kessel was made
welcome, and Czerniak began to deliver on its promises at once, establishing
a small modular base camp on Bede for the Osagi to utilize in salvage
operations on the main world, in exchange for a number of Jump-0 drives for
trade purposes. Repairs on two of the Osagi major warships began in late
August, and were finished in late September. But in early September in two
attacks, The Osagi Navy & Von Kessel's small squadron successfully swept
both Strat and Ajjeig clear of their Vampire ships, some of whom were
remnants of Osage's evacuation fleet that misjumped in 1130. This yielded
more answers, and a few low-berthed colonists who were never disturbed, as
well as spare parts for the remaining vessels of the Osagi Navy. The Osagi
were impressed by the Soleeans performance in these two "battles".
     <P>  In the last week of September, the combined forces of Von Kessel's
ships, the Czerniak Missile boats, and the Osagi Navy fell upon the Syrs
system, and destroyed the Vampire system worlds of Franc and Ruble. Czerniak
's MB's & Osage's Navy swept the system of stragglers, and conducted follow
on mop-up operations into Early November 1202. Some of the Vampires escaped,
but the mission hadn't enough ships to pursue them all.  The liberated
system in 1203 became a source of military drain for Czerniak whose SDB
squadrons were posted here to maintain it Vampire & Guild free.<P>
               Von Kessel's strategy was based on the island-hopping tactics
of a wet Terran Navy from ages past. working with the knowledge of the relic
Tukera/Transstar J-3 & J-4 freighters Galines and Czerniak had in their
possession. The Osagi made excellent allies, and Czerniak and Galines, both
heavily settled systems, looked forward to trade with the Osagi for the J-0
engine.<P>
               Yerhen' s TED, who brutally enslaved his Droyne population,
something which the Soleeans themselves didn't disapprove of (abusing
aliens), but also utilized slavery of low tech slaves the Guild brought him
from Thoezennt (particularly Burlta's natives), found himself on the wrong
side of indentured servitude in the first week of December 1202, as Von
Kessel's squadron headed back to Jayna. Czerniak had briefed him on their
two years of surveillance and spying on this warlord. They had fostered a
local resistance group, and in a twenty-hour long strike from orbit,
decapitated Warlord Hesii Baarza & his core "Loyal Brigades". A more
amenable Governor was (S) elected by the "resistance" (Czerniak's CIA
sponsored cadre actually). The 7 million Droyne were slightly better off,
being reduced to second- class citizens from gulag PWs & forced laborers.
Czerniak moved in quickly, and re-established their hegemony behind their
"anointed" leader, who resolved to solve the world's problems by outside
trade (imagine that!), and allowing the allies of the resistance to build a
C-class port downside (staffed and run by TKHL personnel, of course).
     The year's progress was heralded to Solee By new years day, and RAdmiral
von Kessel was becoming something of a legend, and an irritant to the
Lucan-Remnant Commanders of Solee's Imperial Fleet. Despite being given the
fewest ships, the least amount of his cadre from his relic ship, he had
molded the Jayna Fleet in four short years into a leaner meaner TED busting
trained machine. Solee could boast it spanned nearly across three
subsectors, and had gained a potent ally in Osage in the fractured Exage
system, allowing for the creation of a fleet already in place to defend the
"new spinward frontier".<P>
        His enemies however had swelled to include almost all of the former
Lucan remnants, and many Soleean Navy leaders not under his command.
Politically, his views towards the Droyne on Yerhen, and the Bwap of Osage,
made him a liability to those more "politically correct" of the Human
supremacists faction, subscribed to by even  Admiral Eshraa bint Reine, and the
head of SIS, Hugo von Adraskaar. But he had allies too, in the powerful
Cardinal Margaera de Messina of Montero and Kestral, and had the favor of
the Empress, and was considered an invaluable liaison with the newest allies
in Syrs subsector from Osage.<P>
    Then as fate would have it in the spring of 1203, when conferencing with
Admiral bint Reine on plans for the Shenk and Thoezennt subsectors, and the
looming war with the "Reformed Coalition" and their alien Hiver allies
(Solee's Empress, Admiralty & Military command did not entertain a peaceful
resolution to this Pocket empire to rimwards of themselves), von Kessel
expressed doubts to the plan. From his understanding of SIS intelligence on
the PE to rimwards in Old Expanses, and from spies on Mueller watching the
Hiver technological mission there, The RC had access to a steady stream of
TL-14 relic equipment, and that the Hivers, while themselves pacifists,
would sell these "Star Vikings" superior technological aide, in order to
battle against Solee & her allied worlds in the "empire". He advocated a
peaceful resolution, as both Interstellar States had a vested interest in
ridding the Old Expanses of the Guild, and Vampire raiders, and relied on
Trade between systems apparently. He also believed Solee's empire was a bit
"fragile" trade ship to warship wise (a by-product of the "3 to 1" deal made
with Czerniak & Galines). His suggestions were coldly met as "cowardice, and
defeatism". He was removed from Fleet command and to avoid scandal, placed
in charge, once more, of the Depot facility in the coreward end of Jayna
Subsector in February of 1203, more or less a figure head with very little
to command, ironically a virtual prisoner of the system he had liberated for
his new empire's benefit.<P>
     Admiral Von Kessel's warnings of the fragility of the Solee empire were
vindicated however, when the TKHL Chairman, Brion Tukera III of Galines &
the Masked Consulate of Czerniak demanded fleet  protection  for their
shipping of the Empress when the Bint Reine blitzkrieg stalled in Shenk &
Thoezennt subsectors as the RC's commerce raiding began to take affect in
February 1204, three months after war had been declared upon Solee by the RC
and Mueller in December of 1203. He was recalled to duty in early March of
1204, along with ships of the Jayna fleet. Von Kessel saw the handwriting on
the wall, and did his best with his dwindling ships for his new Empress.
When bested at the 2nd battle of Sauler by  the combined Task forces
"Guillotine" (CDR Ritter RCN) and  "Honor Harrington" (CDRE Saffron Ghulz,
RCN), he surrendered his remaining ships and crews in June of 1204, even as
TF "Hammer" (Admiral Sean Lathrop, RCN) and TF "Anvil" (Admiral Stassja von Braun,
Mueller Federal Navy) bypassed Yontez, & smashed Herbe, Kmak and then Solee
herself in the same month.  AdmiralWerner von Kessel was the only flag officer
of Solee to survive the war, and was present at the surrender signed aboard
the re-captured RCS Apollo in orbit over Solee in July of 1204, accepted by
CPT Rebekka Guiterrez. He is also the only Imperial remnant officer to have
served in three Navies (Margaret's, Solee's, and the RCN), finishing out his
career in the RCN in 1215 at 60 years of age (biologically).   </UL>
