   <UL>

   A rather bland, stout woman, Mrs. Stanely is infamous subsector-wide as the sole survivor of the
   doomed shuttle <I>Wayrith</I>.
   <P>
   The <I>Wayrith</I> was en-route to an insystem mining colony when an engine malfunction occurred.
   Because of the loss of fuel, the best the captain could do was put the shuttle in an elliptical orbit
   around the colony, and await rescue.
   <P>
   Rescue was long in coming. Meanwhile, food ran out, and eventually lots were drawn to determine
   who get's eaten. Mrs. Stanley - the sole woman on-board - managed to excempt herself on the
   basis of her pregnacy and persuading the men not to kill her. "Imagine what the press would say! You
   wouldn't last a day in court!"
   <P>
   When the rescuers finally arrived, only Mrs. Stanely and her newborn infant lived. When they spotted
   her - in a haze of bones, split for their marrow - her first words were "Look, darling! Food! Food!"
   <P>
   She arrived home in a wave of sensationalism and notoriety. Aquitted of all charges, she became very
   wealthy and a major figure of controversy. Most of her money she blew in buying a large home in a
   prestigous ungerground location, but she still has enough to tour the subsector with her 6-year old
   son.
