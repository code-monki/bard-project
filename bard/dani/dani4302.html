<UL><B>Background:</B>
   <UL>Born on Deneb/Deneb, Suvarov's childhood dream was to join the Regency Marines. He served two tours in
the Marines with distinction, obtaining several citations and metals, including the Regent's Star for
spearheading an attack on a nasty enemy strongpoint in 1194.
<P>
All that he worked for was lost when he callously murdered a non-combatent on the battlefield in
1196. Although his unit didn't report this crime to the authorities, rumour's about his action
eventually reached an officer, who set court-marshal proceedings in motion. Because of his previous
heroism Suvarov wasn't shot: instead he was given 100 lashes with a neurowhip and dishonourably
cashiered, with his life savings paid out to the victim's wife as restitution.
<P>
Without honour, without his friends, and without a future, Suvorov would soon have destroyed
himself in drugs or drink if he wasn't rescued by a compassionate priest. After repenting of his sins,
paying penance, and converting into the Imperial Church, he requested and, after careful testing using
Zhodani techniques, was allowed to join the M.O.C.
<P>
His sterling record with the M.O.C. has finally landed his first independent assignment, with
<A href="dani4911.html">Adept
Flourentine</A>: an opportunity to prove himself a reformed Christian that Suvarov has been waiting for.

<UL><B>Appearance:</B>
   <UL> Unattrative, though not repulsive. A hard, bony face, framed by dirty blond hair, is set upon a 6-foot
sinewy, big-boned body. Clothing is either ill-fitting civvies or worn military fatigues. Has a thick
Denebi accent when he speaks, which is seldom.  Sticks close to the Adept in the field.
</UL>
</UL>
<UL><B>Personality:</B>
   <UL> Laconic. No longer beat's up people on impulse, but is still tempted. Despite his distain for authority
he is loyal to his order and his God, and is both quick-witted and fearless in action.

His great goal is to obtain fame and renoun, to cleanse his name and be a hero to his people, `to sieze
the Glory'. His every action, every though is directed to this one goal.
