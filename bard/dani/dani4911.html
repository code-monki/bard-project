   <UL>

   At a very young age, Leonidas decided to become a num, and was enrolled in the Society of Mary
   Magalene. She enjoyed her stay at the convent at Ash/Pretoria/Deneb, and now- after an extensive education,
   Adept Forentine - and her Champion, <a href="dani4302.html">Aleksandr Suvarov</A> - are preparing to enter the Wilds, to
   recontact the faithful of the Imperial Church, convert the heathen, spread antiviral tools and
   techniques, and gather sociological information to bring back to the Church leaders on Mora.
   <P>

   Leonidas hopes to do a good enough job so that not only will she be initated into full sisterhood, but
be given a pernament mission to tend.
Her 800,000 member order is spread throughout the trailing and coreward edge of the Regency, with a
special concentration in Pretoria and Lamas subsectors.

<UL><B>Appearance:</B>
   <UL>
The first thing one notices about her is her unmistakable clothing. A dark blue, TL F nun's robe with
habit, it's usually speckled with shimmering, twinkling stars that can dissapear with a guesture or a
verbal command. It provides an AV of 2.
<P>
Forentine herself is thin and willowy, though on the short side. her face is of uncertain origin, usually
placid, with naturally arched eyebrows and dark brown eyes. Her black hair is hidden by white cloth.
 </UL>
</UL>
<UL><B>Personality:</B>
   <UL>
Enthusiastic and mystical. Her unlimited faith in God, grant's her the stamina to endure any trial:
however, her spritual orientation(ie. her lips moving in silent prayer, unexpected religious trances,
religious laguage popping into non-religious conversation, talking to angels) can make people
nervous. However, her natural love of people - especially the poor, sickly and hurting - tend to cover
her faults. She still has some very weird eating habits, though.
<P>
Her most enjoyable pastime are her soaring chant's: she's always learning new chant's to add to her
extensive repritore. When attacked, she react's in a passive-aggresive manner, often infuriating her
opponenbt or dumping guilt on them. Her most deadly weapon is a low-profile, razor-sharp wit: she
can make even the most arrogant and proud opponentlook like a blind and stupid fool, but she'll never
openly and directly attack anyone.
<P>
Usually quite easygoing, she can be stubborn and manipulative over issues she feels is important.
Oftentimes, she can even literally get sick until she get's what she want's.
