<UL><B>Background:</B>
   <UL>
He was born on 1167 on the water world of Nova
Terre in Glimmerdrift Reaches.  He was left an orphan when his parents
died in one of many rebel uprisings against the
virus government that controlled his planet.
He was adopted into the Ngoyen clan before he
turned eight.  The Ngoyen clan was one of the
most important clans on Nova Terre, and was a
key element in the foundation of the New Earth
Republic.
<P>
The Ngoyen clan at the time was in engaged in a
shadow war with the Virus controlled government,
and other puppet governments on the planet.  In
such circumstances, children were often used as
gun runners and assassins.  All capable males,
and all females interested were trained in the
martial arts.  Andrei showed significent skill,
and was selected as the Ngoyen adept to study at
the Monastary at Ilaria.  Ilaria had previously
been the subsector capital of the Verge subsector,
and had been the site of the only psionics center
in the imperial parts of the sector.  Even in the
New Era people would come from all over the verge
subsector to join the Ilarian Knights.  Andrei
and the adepts from several other clans were then
smuggled off-planet as "slaves" on a free-trader
ship.  On Ilaria they were psionically tested and
trained, and assigned a sensei.  As a result of
high level negotiations between the grand council
of the Ilarian Knights, the Ides of March merc
group, and the various elements of the Tavar Ryal 
resistance movement, these groups joined forces
in an attempt to liberate Tavar Ryal (the planet
only officially changed names to Nova Terre after
the <a href="../bardperi.html">Rim League</a> Rebellion succeeded in 1196), 
Ilaria, and Teloras.  These groups formed the
Rim League.
<P>
After spending four years of intense planning and
training, the Rim League forces were smuggled
back on planet.  The Ryaltan Civil War started
during 1188 and lasted until 1196.  During the 
first four years of the war, Andrei and his sensei
served as members of the rebellion.  During their
tour of duty they helped run weaponry to the clans
of the Southern March.  They also served as guards
for various high level strategy meetings.  During
the third year of the war, the old abandoned Scout
base was located by the rebels.
<P>
They recommissioned the base, and established a
flight academy.  Andrei having been one of the
few people with significant starship experience
was one of the members of the first class.  They
were trained secretly, and spent the last two
years of their training gaining experience from
acting as the forward intelligence screen for the
Rim League Navy.  With the final victory over the
virus forces on the 15th of March 1196, the Rim
League Explorer Corps was officially founded.
Andrei has served as a explorer for the Corps for
the next four years.  
<P>
Due to the shortage of ships, Explorer Corps
personel have been asked to seek joint employment
on starhips other than those ran expressly by the
Explorer Corps.  Andrei and his sensei (who is 
now an official diplomat for the Rim League) were
looking for employment as such when the advertisement
came through.
