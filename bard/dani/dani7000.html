<FONT SIZE=6>Cults of Lucifer</FONT><P>

<UL><B>Phos/Skotos</B>
   <UL>Phos is is the god of light and good, his counterpart is 
Skotos, the god of darkness and evil.  Phos promises that the 
virtuous will reside in paradise for eternity.  Skotos promises 
power in the material world and in the hereafter for those who 
will help him in his foul plans. The Vampires serve him, and the 
Virus was his handiwork.  Divine Journey Enterprises goes out 
into the Wilds and trades the natives high tech equipment. They 
also preach the gospel of Phos while they are there.  They resell 
the native goods back in the RC, using the proceeds to finance 
more missions into the Wilds.  The company has two far traders, 
<I>Divine Guidance</I> and <I>Phos' Will</I>.  The church is 
fairly wide spread, and has upwards of 5000 members on Lucifer 
and a sprinkling in the Wilds.</UL>
</UL>

<UL><B>Natural Philosophy Society</B>
   <UL>The Society is less a religion, and more, as its name 
suggests, a group dedicated to espousing a philosophy.  They 
believe that magic is real, and they can cast spells.  They try 
to cast spells that will help the RC overcome its problems.  They 
have seven small chapter houses across Lucifer, and a major house 
in the capital.  The local members gather at their house every 
seventh day. Each chapter house gathers on a different day of the 
week, so that one of the chapter house is always active.  At 
their meetings members teach each other the magic principals that 
they know, and decide which spells the Chapter house will work on 
casting.  Most spells take many weeks of preparations, and 
involve gathering many different exotic substances.  Finally when 
a spell is ready to be cast, the group travels to the Mother 
house, and casts it there.  The Mother house is centered on the 
intersection of several powerful Ley Lines, so any spells cast 
there are much more effective.</UL>
</UL>

<UL><B>Blipdooppop</B>
   <UL>Blipdooppop is an Elder God. She existed long before the 
Ancients, and will exist long after humanity has ceased to be.  
She is awesomely powerful, and demands that all intelligent 
beings worship her.  The Ancients refused, and she destroyed 
them.  Before they died though they were able to use some arcane 
technology to lock Blipdooppop in another dimension where she is 
unable to help her followers.  Her believers are split into two 
camps, those who seek to free her and those which seek to prevent 
this.  Those who wish to free her, believe that she will grant 
them eternal life,and domain over the rest of the humans, when 
she conquers the universe. The others also believe that she is 
destined to conquer the universe, but wish to prolong it to a 
time when they are long dead.  The two groups do agree that the 
Hiver are her most dedicated servants.  This causes the Hivers a 
great deal of confusion, when strange humans come up and ask how 
they can help serve the Great One. The Hivers act very confused.</UL>
</UL>

<UL><B>Cult of the Star</B>
<UL>The Cult believes that their guru, Seala Borgun, is the 
avatar of the Divine Spirit.  As such her word is law, and they 
follow here every wish and command.  Unfortunately for her 
followers Seala is quite mad.  She has them do absurd things, 
which they happily do.  She once had a hundred of her followers 
dressing animal costumes and dance up and down the main 
thoroughfare of the capital.</UL>
</UL>

<UL><B>Anelimism</B>
<UL>Anelimism is not an organized religion that believes in a 
divine being that must be worshipped, rather it is a philosophy, 
that guides its followers through life.  Anelimism says spirits 
inhabit all objects. Objects are represented both on the material 
plane and on the spirit plane.  The followers of Anelimism 
respect those spirits and always ask their permission before 
destroying an object. The destruction of an object also destroys 
the spirit.  The followers are saddened by any destruction, and 
take great join the creation of new objects.  All objects have a 
spirit part, even crude objects such as roads, buildings, and 
vehicles.  The  Anelimists treasure skills such as painting, 
sculpture, woodworking, Anelimists occasionally will ask favors 
of the spirits, such as asking the spirit of a car to continue 
working until the supplicant is home safely.  The supplicant will 
then later make an offering to the spirit.</UL>
</UL>

<UL><B>Church of Stellar Divinity</B>
<UL>The Church of Stellar Divinity is widespread throughout the 
Imperium, it believes that Stars are divine beings and need to 
be worshiped.  If a believer is faithful, after his death, his 
spirit will merge with the stars.  On Parvid a heretic branch of 
the church sprang up. This branch believes that the stars are at 
war with each other, and that people from other planets are 
followers of another star, and must be destroyed.  The branch of 
the church that existed on Luhtala, took this heresy one step 
farther and believes that it is the duty of all believers to help 
fight the war against the other stars.<P>

Before the Collapse, the group was actively seeking to locate a 
working copy of the mythical star trigger. With such a device, 
they could destroy entire stars, and help Lutala's star, Amicron, 
win supremacy.<P>

One possible adventure plot is for the Church to fly in to an 
enemy star system and fire canisters of radioactive waste in to a 
star.  They realize this won't destroy the star, but feel that it 
might weaken the star enough so Amicron might take advantage of 
its momentary weakness.<P>	

The Church also wants to make a device in which they could 
actually enter the atmosphere of the star and commune directly 
with Amicron.  For a possible design see the <I>Sundiver</I> by 
David Brin.</UL>
</UL>

<UL><B>Polytheistic Cult</B>
   <UL>The Angar worship a pantheon of gods. They believe that 
nature is a mirror of the gods. Reality reflects the nature of 
the gods.  If one of the gods was to die or be changed, reality 
would also be changed.  Many of the faithful believe that Tulko, 
god of Voyages, died and this caused the collapse.  Now that the 
RC is rebuilding society, they believe a new god has emerged and 
is helping restart voyages among the stars.  This new god's image, 
shows a sixfold symmetry, much like a hiver does.</UL>
</UL>

<UL><B>Academy of the Mind</B>
   <UL>The Academy believes that they can teach anyone to be a 
psychic.  They detest the term psion, saying that it reeks of 
Imperial propaganda.  They use many crystals, pyramids, and weird 
herbs in their lessons.  They don't try to teach telekinitic arts, 
or others that have a definite impaction the material world, 
rather they teach empathy, fortune telling and the use of mental 
powers to offset illness.  (ie. things that can't be proven not 
to have worked)  The Academy is 130 years old.The Imperials, 
carefully investigated the group, and determined that they were 
frauds, and harmless. The Academy claimed to have used mind 
control on the Imperial Inquisitors.</UL>
</UL>

<UL><B>Disciples of the Bright Way</B> (By Michael Barry)
   <UL>The Disciples of the Bright Way are a sect that believe 
their deity exists in jumps pace, and communicates directly with 
people while they are in jump. They call the sight of J-space 
'The Face of the Deity' and have a secret combination of drugs 
and meditation practices that reduce (but not eliminate!) the 
insanity impact of viewing J-space.<P>

They are generally not dangerous, but their disturbing practice 
of shooting up drugs and staring out of an open porthole into 
J-space during the week of a jump means that most captains will 
refuse to allow them on board under any circumstances.<P>

However, the Disciples will pay an *obscene* amount of money for 
passage on a ship, and since they don't care about bodily 
comforts they are quite happy to bunk two to a stateroom under 
middle passage conditions, and pay up to Cr25,000 each for their 
'pilgrimage'.<P>

The Disciples also own a number of ships that they use for their
own pilgrimages; these are generally decrepit old Scout/Couriers 
or Free Traders that have been roughly remodelled to hold dozens 
of whacked-out weirdos in bunk/flop-house style accommodation. 
These ships have a disturbing number of portholes and viewports.<P>

(The above group is based on the fact that looking directly at 
jumpspace will cause insanity.  This is an unofficial rule.)</UL>
</UL>

<UL><B>Church of the Ancients</B>
   <UL>The Church believes that the Ancients were wise and 
benevolent creatures, who took humanity from its homeworld, of 
Terra in order to teach it a better way.  Before the Ancients 
could enlighten humanity, they evolved onto a higher plane.  The 
Church seeks to continue the enlightenment of humanity.  They try 
to figure out the process in which the Ancients evolved onto a 
higher plane, by examining whatever Ancient artifacts that they 
can get their hands on.  These artifacts are extremely rare, and 
the Church guards them carefully.  Many members have been conned 
into buying clever forgeries.<P>

The Church recognizes that the Ancients also took and genetically 
engineered Terran wolves, into Vargr.  The Church honors and 
accepts the Vargr as fellow sapiens on the path towards 
enlightenment.  Droyne were also known to be servants to the 
Ancients, and the Church accepts them also.<P>

Church members seek to enlighten themselves through meditation.  
They often use replicas of Ancient artifacts in their 
meditations.  The Church is favorably disposed to the RC, and 
believes that it can help enlighten the rest of humanity.  The 
Church often sponsors missions to recover known and suspected 
Ancient artifacts.</UL>
