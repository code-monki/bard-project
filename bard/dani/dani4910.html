<UL><B>Background:</B>
   <UL>
Born into the very small Vargr community on Enos/Sword Worlds/Spinward Marches (less than 1000 menbers), he worked as a
railroader for a decade before being able to buy a low passage ticket to Anduril/Sword Worlds/Spinward Marches .
<P>
On Anduril, he worked in a sweatshop for four long years (his hands still hurt from that time) until he
found his true calling as a guide to the Urgnemoff Desert. Based in the small town of Hunafloi, his
archaic TL 4 tours are bringing in a constant income, allowing him to treat his friends and even import
- at an outragious cost - a TL 4 balloon for his business.

   <P>
Has many connections to the local poor No blood family on Anduril: sends money back to the folks on
Enos. </UL>

<UL><B>Appearance:</B>
   <UL>
Looks like a Vargr on the ropes, with old, dull clothes and a greying, dirty coat of fur. Despite his
semi-impoverished condition, however, Vangtirs still retains a certain pride in himself, and has not
let impoverished circumstances impoverish his soul.
 </UL>
</UL>
<UL><B>Personality:</B>
   <UL>
Loud and boisterous. Quite adventurous and daring, he's willing to take on anything and anyone that
get's in his way... and has the scars to prove it.
