<UL><B>Background:</B>
   <UL>KiLEEeekaa was born on Aubaine on 15/III/1164. She 
   passed the rigorous testing necessary to attend school 
   on dry land where she focused on learning about 
   government and the history of other interstellar 
   governments.  She later attended law school with a 
   hope to go into politics. After graduation, she ran 
   for and was handily elected to the Vras Assembly as one
   of the junior Schalli delegation. She was outspoken in 
   her desire to expand the Vras trading fleet to 
   establish firmer links with Vras' neighbor systems. 
   With the arrival of the Hiver, her views found a whole 
   new forum and she advocated full cooperation with them. 
   Although there were those who questioned the wisdom of 
   relying on an alien species, it was Schalli like 
   KiLEEeekaa who provided the example and the calm voice 
   that was needed to win over the population. KiLEEeekaa 
   was also a major proponent of the Hiver Technical 
   Academy and was one of the chief lobbyists for it 
   being on the newly christened Aubaine, this more out 
   of pride for her homeworld than anything else. She was 
   one of the first delegates of the League of the New 
   Dawn and when the original twelve ships did not return, 
   it was her voice as one of the few who remained calm 
   and helped provide direction and comfort in time of 
   sorrow. KiLEEeekaa knew that her society could not die 
   with those twelve crews, and made it her lifequest to 
   ensure that their journey would not have been in vain 
   and that they would not be forgotten. KiLEEeekaa's 
   famous "Path of Tears" speech shortly after the 
   founding of the Reformation Coalition best summed up 
   the determination and spirit of the new government and 
   the need to push ever forward. Her charisma and 
   notoriety during this period elevated her to the 
   position of Chairperson of Internal Affairs, a 
   committee which oversees the dealings and smooth 
   relations of the varied member worlds of the Coalition. 
   Here she has put her gift for eloquence and her ability 
   to get the job done to it's best use.</UL>

<UL><B>Appearance:</B>
   <UL>KiLEEeekaa is fairly average looking as 
shallow-water Schalli go. She has a rather pink muzzle 
with a deep, almost metallic blue body. Two long yellow 
streaks run down the length of her body, denoting her 
shallow water heritage.<P>
Her face is rather unique and her most striking features 
are her wide-set eyes and rather broad snout. She has a 
habit of flicking her face whiskers when she gets annoyed 
at something.</UL>
</UL>
<UL><B>Personality:</B>
   <UL>KiLEEeekaa is a warm and outgoing sort who likes 
to make others feel at ease around her. She exudes a 
calming presence just by entering a room. In public, she 
is gracious, polite, and ever the statesperson. In her
private chambers or personal meetings, she is warm but 
business-like, and possessed of a determination to 
address whatever is asked of her. In the privacy of the 
sea, she is relaxed and carefree. Only then does she shed 
the aura of statesmanship and allow her true persona to 
peek out. To those who know her best, there is an inward 
sadness. KiLEEeekaa is not unaware of the turmoils her 
people face, and keeps in close touch with her family and
oldest friends, always on the look out for new information. 
Occupied as she is with keeping the Coalition together, 
she feels helpless when she confronts the fact that she 
cannot even help to maintain the unity of her own people.<P>
The only time KiLEEeekaa will ever become truly upset and 
fearsome is when dealing with those that would try to 
destroy that which she has helped to create. She does not 
just look upon foreign governments and Virus as the chief 
threats to the Coalition, but those who would damage it 
from within. This includes factions such as the Humanists, led by 
<A HREF="dani0001.html">Jonas Bigalow</A>, and the feudal 
technocrats who seek a more centrist and less free form 
of government for the Coalition member worlds.</UL>
</UL>
<UL><B>Motivation:</B>
   <UL><I>Spade Ace:</I> KiLEEeekaa is a highly 
charismatic individual and can win over some of the most 
stubborn souls. This manifests itself as a natural 
eloquence she possesses and an aura of confidence and 
ability. She is not shy about this ability either and 
uses it to champion her beliefs.</UL>
   <UL><I>Heart 9:</I> KiLEEeekaa is strongly motivated 
to improve the condition of all those around her. This is 
her reason for entering public service. She is that rare 
instance of someone who, at no personal benefit to herself, 
would like to see the quality of life elevated for all 
other sentient beings. This also manifests itself as a 
strong desire to see the Reformation Coalition and all 
that it stands for survive and prosper. She truly 
believes that it is this corner of the galaxy's best hope 
for restoring civilization without returning to the 
callous disregard of the rights of the individual and the
devaluation of life that existed in the Imperium. She also 
strongly opposes those that would corrupt or distort that 
dream. She is a bitter enemy of those who would use the 
Coalition's resources for personal gain or to inflict pain 
on the innocent.</UL>
</UL>
<UL><B>Refereeing KiLEEeekaa:</B>
   <UL>KiLEEeekaa is the epitome of the phrase "tough old
broad". While to her friends she is suitably warm and 
fuzzy and to the people she is the champion of their 
ideals, to her enemies she is a ruthless and dangerous 
opponent. It takes a strong character to do the job she 
does. The Coalition is a diverse place with many 
different cultures and ideals, and it takes a lot of 
effort to keep these variables working together. This is 
the job KiLEEeekaa excels at. Her gift for rhetoric is 
only matched by her gift for compromise. She, however, 
will never cut a deal that she feels is harmful to 
individual sentient's rights or to the Coaliton as a 
whole. It is also KiLEEeekaa's job to integrate conquered 
or recently admitted worlds into the Coalition 
infrastructure. While the Foreign Relations board seeks 
to secure the best and most ruthless deals with the 
Coaliton's neighbors, so as to show them who is the 
master and who the servant, KiLEEeekaa's Internal Affairs 
board is charged with bringing new members into the fold 
as gently and smoothly as possible. These worlds are made 
to feel welcome and are almost coddled in the attempt to 
make the transferrance from foreigner to member world as 
quickly and easily as possible. Probably the two areas of 
conflict the KiLEEeekaa is involved with is the annoyance 
that is the Humanists Party and the real threat, she feels, 
to the future of the Reformation Coalition, the Centrists 
Party. The Humanists' leader, 
<A HREF="dani0001.html">Jonas Bigalow</A>, and KiLEEeekaa 
have had legendary wars of words with one another on the 
floor of the Assembly, some speeches going on for hours at 
a time. In private, they tend to avoid each other, 
speaking only when they must, that being at times when 
new worlds are being brought into the Coalition. It is at 
these times that the real war rages, as they are not
constrained by the decorum of the Assembly hall and can 
let each know how they truly feel. Their relationship is 
one that will never reach true physical violence, but one 
that will not allow these two to look upon each other as 
anything less than the biggest thorn in their respective 
sides. Aside from this little diversion, KiLEEeekaa must 
deal with the Centrists and their attempt to remold the 
Coalition into their image.  Because she is the senior 
Aubani delegate, it is she to which other Federalists 
look to as the chief proponent of their cause in the 
Assembly. Despite her other duties, she is fully prepared 
and capable to step forward at a moments notice to defend 
any piece of Federalist legislation, and debate with her
every breath each piece of Centrist legislation. Her 
speeches in favor of the Federalist position are 
legendary, and her status as a founding member of the 
Assembly lends even more weight to her arguments. 
Currently, she is occupied in debates regarding the 
Ship Bill, which has confused the traditional lines of 
Centrist and Federalist. KiLEEeekaa is in favor of the
bill, but understands the misgivings others feel that 
this might lead to an increased central authority. She 
sees it as better than allowing too much power to be 
concentrated in the hands of a few technocrats, a 
situation which might bring the problem of too much 
central authority to light on its own. Her other concern 
is the call for a constitutional convention. She is not 
sure yet how she will handle this issue yet, but she 
knows it will likely be the toughest challenge she has 
ever had to face.</UL>
