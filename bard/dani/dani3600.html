<h3>HISTORY</FONT></h3>
 In 1131 a virus infected the main computer of the
University of Jeddel observatory on Jeddel/Pasdaruu/Diaspora.
It became a hobbyist and maintained the observatory for use by
itself.  Late in the year 1147 a Vampire infected  <i>Avenger</i> Strike
Cruiser, the Flandry, jumped in the  system. The two Vampires
started communicating, after determining that neither was a
threat to the other they struck up a friendship.  Over the next
few years the Flandry returned to the Jeddel system, to talk and
visit with the Observatory.  In the 1160's the two  Vampires  
decided that they wanted to create a child.  The Flandry captured
an Frontier Transport (see World Builder's Handbook), and brought
it back to the system. This wasn't an standard Frontier Transport,
but a <a href="../sara/sara7022.html">Jump 6 version</a> maintained by the Imperium for use as
secret couriers. Each Vampire donated a portion of its code, to
create a new Virus which was a blend of the two systems. They
infected the transport with this new Virus.<P>

        After greeting its parents and down loading their memory
banks, the new Vampire set out on a journey of discovery. After
several years of wandering Diaspora sector, the White Star as it
now called itself, determined a life goal for itself. After 
examining the memory banks of the Observatory the White Star became
obsessed with neutron stars, the degenerate remains of stars that
undergo supernovas.  It really wanted to study the creation of 
a neutron star up close and  personal,  but they are fairly rare
and do not happen very often.<P>

      It then remembered that there is another way  to  make  a
neutron  star, if a white dwarf gains enough mass to exceed the
Chandrasekhar Limit of 1.4 solar masses it will explode in a 
supernova and leave behind a neutron star. This usually happens in
close binary systems, but the White Star decided to try to do
this to a single white dwarf. It found a large white dwarf of
1.2 M and started the long process of transferring over .2  solar
mass  of  material  onto the white dwarf. The White Star tried to
think of a quick way to do this, but the only method it  had  the
capabilities  to pursue was the loading up of its cargo bays with
dirt and rocks and dumping them onto the white  dwarf.   This  is
over  4 x 10<sup>26</sup> tons that needs to be dumped on the white dwarf. The
White Star knows that this is immense job, but it has become  ob-
sessed  with  the  idea of making a neutron star, and this is the
best way to get the job done.<P>

        The White Star flys to the nearest planet, has its robot-
ic workers load the cargo bay with rocks and dirt. The White Star
then flys towards the white dwarf, when inside the gravity  well,
the  White  Star  opens  its cargo bay doors, and dumps the stuff
onto the star.<P>

        Every year the White Star travels  to  a  nearby  Vampire
controlled  starbase and gets an annual maintenance it also stops
by and visits Observatory.  The Observatory monitors several neu-
tron  stars  and gives the observations to White Star.  The White
Star analyses the data over the course of the next year.

<h3>PERSONALITY</h3>
The White Star is a Hobbyist  Vampire.   It  is  ob-
sessed  with  creating  a neutron star. It doesn't mind humans at
all, as long as they don't interfere with the creation of a  neu-
tron star.  If contacted by humans, it will be quite friendly. If
allowed the chance, it will go into great lengths about its  pro-
ject,  and neutron stars.  It will also attempt to get the humans
to help in its glorious task.  In fact the White  Star  would  do
anything to get ahold of better means of transporting matter onto
the white dwarf.  Even exchanging its current ship for  something
that is better able to transport material.<P>

        If anything was to happen to the White Star, the  Flandry
and  the Observatory would eventually find out about it, and make
efforts to avenge their child. The Observatory is not much  of  a
threat,  to  the  average  player character, but the Flandry is a
fully functional TL-15 Strike Cruiser.<P>

        The White Star has often encountered other Vampire  ships
on  its  journey,  it  treats them much like humans, leaving them
alone if they do not hinder its goal.  The White Star has  become
adept  at electronic warfare over the last 20 years, as it fought
off several takeover attempts by Puppetmaster Vampires.  It has a
rating of 8 in Electronic Combat.<P>
