<UL><B>Background:</B>
   <UL>
   Resides on the yacht <I>Sundiver</I> registered from Trin, with eight other wealthy men. Acts as Pilot.

   <P>
   The first 8 years of Mr. Hippocompol's career was as a space bum, working the few lines that operate
   in the Five Sisters. This was his most happiest, most free period, but after a while he realized that he
   needed real money to get where he wanted to go - money only an officer could make. So he sought -
   and quickly got - a berth as a 4th Officer with a shoestring operation.
     <P>
   Except this free trader was a classic dead end. The 130-year old ship had a drunken, abusive captain,
   a neurotic first mate and a lowlife crew of 3 (excluding Hippocompol himself). Eventually, robots with
   a "mild" Virus infection was used instead of humans, with unfortunate results.
     <P>
   Somehow, Hippocompol mamaged to endure 9 years of this, falling deeply into the captain's debt in
   the meanwhile. Eventually, the captain died an unexpected death (details remain cloudy: the ship's
   internal sensors went out a loooong time ago). As the sole member of the crew to return, the ship
   was his under Karin law, and he sold it to the scrappers for a fair sum of money.
     <P>
   He reinvested this money in a part-ownership of a small business for grav-furniture, and blossomed
   into this business' top salesman. Spending 7 years, tirelessly working to make something of himself
   eventually turned him into a very wealthy man: his share of the business was bought out at the tune
   of 14 MCr.
     <P>
   And now, after all that agony and estascy, what to do? Well, to become the man he always wanted to
   be - the playboy without a care in the world. But the time the PC's meet him, he's tired of playing
   around. He owes quite a lot of people back in the Five Sisters, both in reward and punishment.
   Despite his good looks, he can feel the age in his bones, and wants to 'clear his accounts' before he
   dies. If the PC's accept his patronage, you should perpare for quite an adventure.

<UL><B>Appearance:</B>
   <UL> A very handsome man, he could easily pass for a movie star. Tall and fit, with brown hair, sky-blue
eyes and an easy smile. Excercises daily.
</UL>
</UL>
<UL><B>Personality:</B>
   <UL>Well, actually Mr. Hippocompol (call him Carvell) doesn't actually *have* a personality: instead, he
determines what others like to see, and projects that image.
<P>
He does have a major drive, however: success (much of which he already has!) If anyone threatens
his accomplishments, he can easily enter into a rage. If you don't, then he's the best of friends.
<P>
While on the chartered yacht, his favourate image is that of "playboy". Debonair, wealthy, successful,
sophisticated and cosmopolitian are good descriptors of his public style here.
<P>
Perhaps the only 'real' facet of his life is his hobby as a 'technological archelogist', that is, his desire
to obtain TL 7 to TL B artifacts, older than 800 years. His actual knowledge of history is thin, but he's
a good actor, and loves the feel of history in his hands. </UL>
