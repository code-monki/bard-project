<UL><B>Contacts:</B> 
<UL><B>Maria Von Bek</B>-You met Von Bek while working for the Fijan Intelligence
branch of the Fijan World Police.  The World Police are the one division
of the government that is not up for bid. It acts independently except
for a review panel, which investigates any police misconduct.  The 
Intelligence branch investigates plots against the government and
also attempts by Technocrats to influence the bidding process through
illegal means.  Von Bek was a top field agent. You served under her
during the '95 Twin Skys Scandal, where you helped undercover a massive
plot to rig the bidding process.  After that you worked together
occasionaly.  <BR><BR>

<B>Khamyannah Arsto</B>-You met Khamyannah when you were investigating possible
corruption in the Ministry of Development. She was an Assistant Commissioner
and was made liason between the Ministry and the World Police.  With her
help you eventually cracked the case.  You met her several times after that,
usually at official functions.  You heard that she has transfered to the
Reformation Coalilition Service Administration and now heads up the
Commision for External Development.  It is the commision in charge of all
bootstrap and colonization missions in the Wilds.  Her office is located
on the capital of the RC, Aubaine.  She gets sick of being stuck behind a 
desk and often takes tours into the Wilds to inspect boostrap missions.
