<UL><B>Background:</B>
   <UL>Corporal Dobson was raised in a fairly average 
       family, in a fairly average small town. She and a 
       group of friends went to the big city, one weekend 
       when she was seventeen. She doesn't remember much 
       of that weekend, but at the end of it she and three 
       of her friends woke up at an Oriflamme Marine 
       bootcamp. Her friends fought the enlistment without 
       success, but Dobson found that she actually liked 
       the marines. It finally gave her life some 
       direction. She served with distinction, and was 
       given a chance to join the THIRD, she leapt at the 
       chance. A RAM grenade cost her her arm on Spencer. 
       She simply had it replaced.</UL>
