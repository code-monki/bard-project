<UL><B>History:</B>
<UL>Nina Porzucovich was born and raised on Baldur.  She never got along with her 
parents, often fighting with them.  When she turned 16 she ran away from 
home. She went to the main undersea dome, where she fell in with a
ripper gang known as the Killer Verms.  After several years of preying
on the underdwellers, the Technopolice made a major push to eliminate the
ripper gang problem. The police surrounded the gang, and after a pitched
gun battle, only Nina was left alive, she fled to the starport, where
she stowed away on an outbound freighter.  The Free Trader crew found
her a few days into the journey, but instead of spacing her they abandoned
her on their next stop.<BR><BR>

Luckily for Nina, a corsair known as the <I>Blood
Moon</I>, was also in port.  After days of trying to find a place to hole up,
Nina spilled her story to a crewman on the <I>Blood Moon</I>, who she thought was 
simply a Free Trader. The crewman brought her to the Captain, who wanted to
find out what she knew about the Free Trader.  Nina managed to convince the 
Captain to let her join the crew. After several years of pillaging up and 
the coreward sections of Alpha Crucis, Nina was captured in a raid on 
Gethsememe (0801 Alpha Cru).  She was sentenced to life in prison, but three 
years later, she was the government was over thrown in a military coup, and she
escaped in the confusion. She managed to hitch a ride back to the Old Expanses.<BR><BR>

	By now, the Refomation Coalition had just been formed, and she decided
that this presented a safer opportunity than the life of a pirate.  She
signed up with a group of lancers operating out of Kal. They operated
for several months, before disaster struck. On a mission to Nicosia against
the Australian Empire, her group was ambushed and decimated.  Once again
Nina was the only person left alive. She managed to pilot the ship back to 
civilization.  She decided that her past might catch up to her, and switched
IDs with one of her dead collegues.  She had her body surgically altered to
match the her co-worker's description, and went looking for another job.
She was now Slea Sorga, from the planet Shenandoah. The reputation of the
true Slea Sorga was good enough to win her a job with Assemblymen MacBaen's
team of explorers. <BR><BR>

Slea is fairly ruthless, she will kill to accomplish her goals, but only if
it is neccesary. She is not the slightest bit sadistic.  She doesn't have
any immediate goals, she lives only for the moment.  <BR><BR>
