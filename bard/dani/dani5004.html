<h3>Headquarters</h3> Aerfor/Millions/Deneb
<P>
<h3>History</h3> The Rose Brotherhood was originally the Roseheart Brigade, a
combination star/ground merc unit that was operating against Vargr
corsairs and raiders in Millions subsector during the Civil War
period. The unit suffered heavy losses when Vargr forces overran
Aerfor in 1120, being reduced to a single damaged Shaar Muzaandi
class heavy transport. During the retreat the transport misjumped
into empty space about six thousand AUs outside of Aerfor, and the
surviving crew and soldiers spent the next twenty one years in cold
sleep while the vessel coasted towards the system on what residual
velocity it had left.
<P>
When the occupants of the vessel awakened in 1141, they found that
Aerfor was under the control of several Vargr warlords, some
possessing armed spacecraft of their own. The survivors used their
remaining fuel to land on Daleth, near the ruins of the old research
station. Using their vessels remaining pinnace, the Roses landed on
Aerfor, reconnoitering the world for items that they could either
steal or salvage. On one of these missions they discovered that top
Vargr warlord had an Aezadhon Emissary Cruiser that he kept in hiding
to safeguard against his subordinates and vassals. In a raid that is
now legendary in Millions and the Regency Wilds, two mixed platoons
of Roseheart space and ground troopers made a drop landing in the
middle of "King" Knaedzaeng palace grounds, and while one platoon
launched a diversionary attack on the main palace, the other platoon
overwhelmed the troops guarding the Aezadhon, seized the ship, and
used its weapons to all but level the place. With his seat of power
destroyed, it was only a few months before the other warlords removed
him from both power, and this life.
<P>
Renaming themselves the Rose Brotherhood, they used their newly
acquired ship to rebuild their arsenal, including several other
ships, and to recruit new members. The Roses have silently sworn a
blood oath against the Vargr warlords and corsairs that plague this
corner of the Wilds, and they have used a war of terror and
assassination against them and the occasional Pack group operating in
Millions. Since 1145 nearly eighty percent of the Pack and corsair
infrastructure has been destroyed, aided in large part by the Roses'
alliances with local insurgents and legitimate governments.
<P>
<h3>Organisational Data</h3> The Rose Brotherhood is organised along the
lines of an ancient knightly order. The group is commanded by Grand
Master elected for his competence and charisma. The Grand Master
commands the entire Brotherhood, and his word is life and death,
though he is subject to the recall vote of the entire Brotherhood
should his actions be interpreted as being contrary to the bylaws and
spirit of the Brotherhood's Charter. Below him are Chevaliers, who
command lagers comprising 20-40 members each, either scattered
throughout Millions in covert groupings or found at the main base.
Individual Sergeants are under the Chevaliers, controlling units of
6-12 humans or Vargr. The Brotherhoods ships and heavy military
hardware are kept at the main base on Daleth in the Aerfor system,
though these are often seconded to individual lagers. Their exist
seperate lagers for training, diplomacy, logistics and intelligence
gathering outside of Millions.
<P>
Joining the Brotherhood is a lifetime commitment. Most join the group
as teenagers, and can be of either sex or any local species. These
squires are apprenticed to a lager until they either demonstrate full
maturity and skill, or reach the customary adult age of their
homeworld. After a final initiation ceremony they recieve the
distinctive black body armor, goggled face mask, and weapons and are
knighted as full Brothers. Discipline is harsh, and indoctrination in
the groups mission is all encompassing, so that by the time a Squire
is made a Brother, he or she is fanatically loyal to it and its
Charter.
<P>
Relations between the Regency of Deneb and the Brotherhood have been
relatively good, with qualifications. Being originally composed of
Denebian military personnel, and the recognition of the Regency's
commitment to preserving civilisation has cemented the Roses loyalty.
But they disdain RQS and the less than honest dealings of their Souk
allies; preferring to deal directly with the Regency military or
diplomatic agencies. The Brotherhood prefers the role of an ally
rather than a subordinate, and does not take orders from Denebian
forces except when they consider it in their best interest.
<P>
<h3>Ships</h3>

1300 ton <I>Shaar Muzaandi</I> Transport: RBS <I>Black Rose</I><BR>
800 ton <I>Ukhernedae</I> Missle Frigate: RBS <I>China Rose</I><BR>
600 ton <I>Aezadhon</I> Emissary Cruiser: RBS <I>Damask Rose</I><BR>

<h3>Range</h3> The Rose Brotherhood is largely confined to Millions
Subsector. Lacking normal merchant ships, as they are not a Free
Trader collective, they rarely journey out of the Millions Bisector
except on missions of great importance, such as resupply trips to
Antra subsector. They do have intelligence gathering groups in Antra
and Atsah, and have made rare forays into both Tuglikki and Corridor
in the past.
