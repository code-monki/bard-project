<UL><B>Background:</B>
   <UL>
   Isabella was born in the Hive Federation and was raised by an industrial Nest.  When Isabella became of age, it attended
   the local university.  In the course of its studies, Isabella became interested in humans. It took courses on human history, psychology, biology and culture.  To further understand the human enigma, it took several field trips to various human worlds.  Some of these worlds had been part of the Federation for centuries, while others were independent worlds that had been ravaged by the Virus. 
   <P>
   After eight years of studying, Isabella applied for and was accepted to the Federation Development Agency.  The FDA was in charge of mounting expeditions into the Wilds.  Isabella saw the FDA as a way to gain more data on humans.  During its time with the FDA Isabella learned how to apply the knowledge that it had learned at school.  It also learned skills that were more applicable to the field than to the classroom.  It also learned how to handle itself in dangerous situations. 
      <P>
   Isabella went on several missions to contact worlds, and in the later portion of its career it was instrumental in helping to establish the Sitah region.   Isabella was not involved with establishing the Dawn League, as it was busy in the Sitah.  Isabella was intrigued by the reports from the Dawn League.  It seemed much more dynamic than the Sitah.  Isabella put in a request to be transferred to the Dawn League.  After several months of paperwork, its request was granted.  
      <P>
   Isabella arrived on Oriflamme in 1200, and was there to see the first reports come back as to the fate of the Twelve.  It traveled across the Dawn League studying the effects the loss of the Twelve had on the humans and what their response was.  After several months, Isabella came to believe that the humans were under the influence of several large scale manipulations.  It did not know the exact purpose of these manipulations or who was behind them.  Isabella felt that this was hampering its study of the humans.  It decided to leave the Reformation Coalition and strike out into the Wilds, where the humans were less effected by Hiver manipulations.  The FDA did not have the resources to support this research, so Isabella decided to offer its services to human starship crews that needed competent technical assistance.  Isabella is a fully qualified pilot and astrogator along with being an expert in computers and robotics.

<UL><B>Appearance:</B>
   <UL> To the average human, Isabella looks just like any other hiver.  Those more familiar with
   Hivers will notice that Isabella's skin is tan with several dark brown blotches around its central body.</UL>
</UL>
<UL><B>Personality:</B>
   <UL>Isabella genuinely likes humans.  It feels that they have immense potential, but the Hivers must understand humans better before they can be helped.  Isabella is curious about all aspects of humanity.  It doesn't let human culture norms get in the way of satisfying this curiosity and will sometimes ask inappropriate questions at inappropriate times.  It also doesn't let human ideas of legality interfere with its studies.  On several occasions it has violated local law to acquire data.  <P>
   
   Isabella has the average Hiver's aversion to violence and will not participate in violence if at all possible.  Isabella is not a coward: if a firefight occurs, Isabella will seek cover and then observe the fight.  It can often be seen making holorecordings of the violence, especially if it involves humans.

<UL><B>Possessions:</B> 
   <UL>Isabella has a large collection of TL-14 exploration and research gear, including several hand computers and various recording gear.  It also has a large collection of human artifacts. Many of these artifacts are not portable, and these are currently in storage on Aubaine.  Isabella has full scans of all these artifacts in case the need arises to study them in more detail.
