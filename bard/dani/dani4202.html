<UL><B>Background:</B>
   <UL>
He was just another minor TV personality when he first got involved in the Hetot M, a political
organization that wants the democratically-elected Regency Planetary Resident to control domestic
affairs also, thus becoming the defacto head of government rather than the current non-charismatic
dictator Fieerield e'Orentav, President of Cyan/Pax Rulin/Trojan Reaches for the last 17 years.

Of course, e'Orentav is not pleased at all: he considers Citizen Gurewich to be "a threat to social
harmony", often placing him under house arrest and conducting petty harrasment against him. The
Resident, placed in a delicate diplomatic position, has worked hard to distant herself from Gurewich's
campagin while trying to persuade e'Orentav to soften the `fascist-lite' nature of his government,
giving the general public a greater voice in planetary affair's.
<P>
Throughout the Regency - and on Cyan - public opinion view Gurewich as a folk hero, a speaker for
the Average Joe, uncontrolled by The Man. The high level of Regency media attention has forced the
dictator to avoid taking `extreme measures' to deal with Gurewich, instead relying on an
unsuccessful slander campagin.
<P>
Despite his importance to the Hetot M, Gurewich insist's on spending half the year in an undersea
cavern with other Initaties, engaging in the worshiping of Neptune (yes, the same Roman god).
During these times of seculsion, the government can afford to increase it's heavy-handed actions
against the democrat's, as Regency media attention drop's drasically.
<P>
He has one wife and two small sons (ages 5 and 3)
