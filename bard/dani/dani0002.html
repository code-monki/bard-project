<UL><B>Background:</B>
   <UL>McBaen was born on Aurora in 1144, to a working class 
parents who worked in one of the new automated factories.  After 
going to college, he joined a law firm and was on the fast track 
towards a full partnership.  After a few years of working in the 
office, he realized that something was missing; his life had 
become dull and lacked passion.  MacBaen decided to enter 
politics to solve the problems that he saw around him.  His 
first campaign, was for mayor of Briston, the largest city on 
Aurora.  He lost, and lost badly, getting barely 10% of the vote.  
He thought about quiting, but realized that even though he lost, 
the campaign had  been the most fun he ever had. <P>

In 1176 He ran for a seat in the World Assembly, this time he 
fared much better, and won a close race over the incumbant. He 
helped start the funding for the Auroran space program.  He has 
always had a passion for space, and has often said he wishes he 
was a bit younger, and he could be one of those rocket jocks.  
Most Aurorans were fascinated by the space program and they fell 
in love with this young brash senator.<P>

In 1194 Hivers contacted Aurora. MacBaen resigned his post to act 
as an ambassador. He took a six month cruise with the Hivers, 
helping them deal with the humans they encountered on Zloff, Hite 
and Fija.  He was instrumental in helping craft the Dawn League 
Accords, which were the documents which created the Dawn League.  
After that he returned to the newly renamed Aurora, to help his 
people deal with their new neighbors. He helped organize support 
for the Twelve, and was disappointed that Aurora was unable to 
launch a ship of its own.  After the Twelve were declared lost, 
he was heartbroken, he thought that the League was about to 
collapse. Others didn't give up hope and were able to push the 
League into a new shape, the Reformation Coalition.<P>

While MacBaen didn't have a hand in creating the RC, he realized 
that it could succed where the League had failed.  He ran for the 
single seat that Aurora would have in the new Assembly of Worlds, 
and won easily.  He is a firm member of the Federalist bloc, like 
most Aurorans he believes in personal freedoms, and that 
democracy is the most noble form of government.  He also realizes 
that only through compromise can a group of worlds as diverse as 
the Coalition, hope to survive.  He often gathers together 
moderates in both blocs to move legislation ahead.  He was a key
mover behind the recent compromise on the Ship Bill.<P>

He has also suffered a private tragedy. His son was a newly 
commisioned Lieutenant on the Ashtabula.  He is deeply worried 
over its fate, and fears the worst. If he hears any clues to its 
fate, he will move heaven and earth to get his son back.  His son 
is the only relative he cares about. Both of his parents died 
several years ago, and he has never married. His son was born 
from one of the numerous affairs he has had throughout the years. 
Auroran citizens don't really care about his personal life, as 
long as he does a good job as their represenative.  The Auroran 
press respects the right to privacy of individuals, and doesn't 
intrude if at all possible.<P>

To help rebuild the civilization he has gathered together 
several Auroran investors and they aquired a ship that was found 
by a group of Lancers working for the Auroran Navy. The 
<A HREF="dani0900.html">Argo</A> was 
floating around a gas giant in the Arvid system. It appeared 
perfectly intact and there was no clue to the fate of its former 
crew.  MacBaen has gathered together a crew, from all over the RC. 
The ship will perform missions in the Wilds and also private 
missions for MacBaen.<P>

His hobby is rock climbing, and he often goes into the wilderness 
to relax.  He used to do this by himself, but now that he is a 
member of the Assembly, he is forced to take along an assistant.  
He is also getting on in age, and his staff is worried he might 
hurt himself.  He always has access to holophones, and his 
computers are tied into the global wireless network.<P></UL>
