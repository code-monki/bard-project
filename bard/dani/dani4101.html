<UL><B>Occupation:</B>  CEO, Schunamann und Sohn, AG (the SuSAG megacorp) </UL>

<UL><B>Attributes:</B> <TT>537467-E</TT></UL>
<UL><B>Background:</B>
   <UL>von Schunamann is the achnowledged head of the Schunamann family. The 60 acknowledged family
members form the core of SuSAG; once a megacorp with interest's across the Imperium, it's now
restricted to the Regency providing chemicals, pharmaceuticals, biogeneered products, and
semi-legal psi boosters.
<P>
von Schunamann is only an adequate CEO, delegating much of his duties to trusted aides and pulling
the regins only when he needs to. He spend's much of his time either meeting figurehead duties,
enjoying himself in very high social circles or playing Mechwarrior with other profoundly wealthy men.
[Mechawar is to the Regency what Polo was to the British Empire].
<P>
von Schunamann is happly married - maintaining not even one concubine, to the astonishment of
Court circles - and delight's in his eight children.

Anything he want's.
<P>
His most famous possessions include ancient German memorabelia (including the only known
surviving East German flag in existence), and a Sio Moff zero-G glass sculpture, presented to his
ancestors by Crown Prince Cleon, son of Cleon IV (born 423, crowned 475, assassinated 555).
<P>
Most of his families' treasured possessions is feared lost, somewhere in Magyar sector.
The possessions that von Schunamann most loves, however, are his collection of TL F battle mecha.
These 12-15 m high vechiles/androids, armed with explosive devices (which cause more flash than
damage) are used in a variety of "Mechasports".
