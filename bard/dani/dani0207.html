<UL><B>Background:</B>
   <UL> 
Cori Stern was born in Deneb Sector in 1083.  Her family had been a marine family for generations.  There was never any doubt that Cori would continue this tradition.  As a small child she grew up amerced in military traditions.  When Cori turned 17 she entered the Naval Academy at Deneb.  She excelled at the academy and graduated with top honors. She was assigned to the battle rider <I>Hardon Sea</I>.  Her ability and drive impressed her superiors.  When the Fifth Frontier War broke out her ship was ordered to the Spinward Marches.  She served with distinction in several battles and for her efforts during the lifting of the siege of Efate she was knighted into the order of the Starship and Crown.  After the war she continued to serve with distinction.  She quickly became an acknowledged expert in meteoric assaults and Vargr corsair tactics.
<P>
In 1113 she was transferred to the Corridor fleet and helped coordinate several raids against suspected corsair bases in Provence Sector.  When the rebellion broke out the entire Corridor fleet was sent to fight against Dulinor.  Again she served with distinction and in 1119 she was named Baroness for her efforts at the Battle of a Thousand Peaks.  In 1124 she transferred to Marine Special Operations, specializing in action behind enemy lines.  She was put in command of several high priority missions against worlds in Magaret's domain.  In 1126 she was named Marquis Misthaven.  Misthaven was a world in Massilia Sector controlled by Margaret's faction.  Emperor Lucan was willing to give out honors and titles, but he often gave the new nobles fiefs on worlds controlled by other factions. He thought that this would give the newly minted nobles added incentive to win back those worlds.  It also saved him from having to give up lands of his own.  
<P>
In the last few months of 1129 Colonel Stern was sent on a recon mission of Diaspora sector with a Gazelle Close Escort and platoon of Marines.  She had conducted most of her survey when her ship first encountered the effects of Virus.  Her ship was heavily damaged, but she managed to make it to the Unity of Promise.  Under the quarantine efforts of the Unity of Promise her ship was destroyed and she was left stranded on Promise.  Unable to return to her home base she attempted to take up service with the Unity of Promise, but the leaders of the Unity were unwilling to accept service from those loyal to Lucan.  Forced to find something to pay the bills, she and her remaining troops took up service as mercenaries protecting ships against pirates and Vampires.
<P>
For 14 years she lived the life of a StarMerc, until a pirate's RAM grenade nearly took off her leg.  She was forced to take up a non-combat job as she rehabilitated.  She became a unarmed combat instructor for the Promise security forces.  She worked at this for over a decade.  While training the Promise security forces, she grew to love the world and to think of it as home. She had moved around so much after joining the marines that she had never considered a planet home before.  She also knew that she was helping the next generation of officers and soldiers protect the Unity from the ravages of the vampires that swarmed outside of its borders.  In 1156 the vampires unified and a massive fleet overwhelmed the Unity.  The vampiric armies overcame the human defenders and infected many of the remaining computer installations.  Cori refused to give up and joined the resistance in fighting against the Vampiric overlords.  
<P>
The resistance was not particularly effective. It was hampered by a lack of equipment and of trained individuals.  In 1159 the resistance headquarters was attacked and the leadership decimated.  Cori was captured and imprisoned.  For three long years she was a prisoner of the machines.  She was occasionally tortured and occasionally experimented on.  Many of the other captives perished, but even now Cori refused to die.  In 1162 she was transferred to an newly infected Fer-de-Lance Destroyer Escort.  She was intended as a maintenance slave. The newly infected ship was not very intelligent and three months later, Cori was able to escape while on Execute.  She lived with one of the wandering tribes for several months, before the <I>Suicide King</I>, a surviving free trader, landed. The ship risked the planet to pick up ogoden (a small animal with extremely soft fur) pelts.  Cori was able to impress the captain with her extensive combat abilities and he offered her a job as a security expert for the ship.  She was willing to do just about anything to get off this mudball, so she accepted.  
<P>
While Cori was hired to handle security, she helped out the rest of the crew with a variety of tasks.  Cori soon grew to enjoy the life of a small free trader.  For once in her life she was not expected to kill at a moment's notice and she had the time to recover from the ordeal in the Vampire prison camp.  She also found that she was quite good at the merchant business, and was quickly commissioned and promoted.  Also the life of a trader allowed her to find the anagathics that she needed to maintain her youth.   By 1184 she had become Captain of the <I>Suicide King</I>.  She also made numerous contacts in the Free Traders and even a few in the newly formed Guild.  
<P>
In 1194 she encountered the worlds that would form the Dawn League.  Here was the only place that she had found where civilization was on an upward swing.  She could sense that these people was going somewhere, but they were new at this and needed all the help they could get.  She resigned as Captain of the <I>Suicide King</I> and offered her services to the Vras Marine corp as a civilian trainer.  For several years she trained soldiers and marines in the art of surviving in combat.  
<P>
After being around soldiers for a while, a desire to get back in to action started to grow.  Cori thought about volunteering for the Vras Marine Corp, but for her the Marines would always be the Imperial Marines.  To join another marine unit would somehow dishonor the memory of the Imperial Marines.  So instead she decided to fall back on her other military profession and form a StarMerc company.  No one else had experience with StarMercs, so Cori could bring needed expertise to the field.  She decided to start small and recruited a half dozen soldiers that she had met while on Vras, and so the Battle Angels were formed in 1197.  Since then she has come to view herself as a citizen of the entire Reformation Coalition and not as a citizen of any individual member world.  The differences between individual worlds are minute when compared to the chaos of the Wilds.  
<P>
The Battle Angels served aboard ships as security forces, provided escorts for land convoys, and other missions.  For the first few years the Battle Angels did not make a great deal of money, but they built a reputation as small highly trained group that was completely trustworthy.  
<P>
In 1200 when the Twelve were declared lost, Cori realized that the Dawn League was not equipped to deal with the chaos of the Wilds.  She decided to expand the Angels; with a larger force they would be able to take on more important missions.  She envisions the Angels as an elite unit with several platoons.  They will specialize in assault missions and special operations against high value targets.  Missions such as smash and grabs, decapitation raids, search and destroy etc. are the Battle Angels specialties.  They will not take on missions such as garrison duty or peacekeeping.  They would be willing to take on training cadre missions if no other jobs were available, or if they needed time to recover from a particularly dangerous mission.  
<P>
The Angels emphasis honor and ethics in their behavior.  Colonel Stern will only hire out the Angels to legitimate governments or other organizations which she finds worthy.  She is the one who decides if a government is legitimate or not.  The government must enjoy some amount of popular support, and must not be extremely cruel to its citizens.  She views herself as a citizen of the Coalition, so she will not take on missions which prove harmful to the RC.  She would also be willing to hire out to nongovernmental organizations such as a corporation or a group of Free Traders if they were having difficulty with a criminal organization such as a band of pirates.  The Angels will not engage in looting or attacks against unarmed citizens.  
<P>
Colonel Stern has learned to hate and loathe Vampires and the Virus.  She saw what the Virus could to do to civilization during her time in the Unity of Promise, and she will do almost anything necessary to ensure that the same fate does not fall on the RC.  If she hears of any efforts to assist the people of Promise, she will lend all possible support to the effort.  She will never trust so called tame Virus strains such as the Sandman (see Vampire Fleets) or even the snake anti-Virus devices from the Covenant of Suffren.  She has been in contact with the Templars, but choose not to join their organizations, as she felt that they were too fanatical and their leadership had no true experience.  She felt that their lack of experience would lead to trouble.  
<P>
Colonel Stern was a loyal soldier for the Imperium.  During the Rebellion, she choose to stay loyal to the Imperium. Prince Lucan was the next in the line of succession, so that meant he was the rightful emperor.   Personally she didn't think very highly of the Emperor, but he was the emperor and it was her duty to serve him.  She thought that the rest of the factions were opportunist who held their own interests higher than the those of the Imperium.  She was never involved with any war crimes.  Even though she was a loyal Imperial citizen, she is not interested in fighting the battles of the past in the present.  Unlike many remnants she is not interested in arguing about the Rebellion; it is in the past and there is nothing anyone can do to fix it.  It was a horribly tragedy, but its over.  She is also not interested in refounding the Imperium.  The Imperium was a great a powerful nation, but it too is over, and its time to rebuild.  If she ever found out that the Regency survives she would be great to find out that her home planet still lives, and is free from the machines.  If the RC and the Regency ever came into conflict she would be deeply torn, as she loves both of these nations. 
<P>
Stern was brought up in the honor and tradition of the Imperial Marines and she values her integrity.  She places great emphasis on honor and duty.  If she makes a commitment or promise, she will do everything in her power to fulfill that promise.  Over her career, she has killed too many people to keep track of.  The number is probably near a thousand.  She killed dozens of those with her bare hands.  She doesn't enjoy killing, but if it needs to be done, she is willing to do it.   <P>

<UL><B>Appearance:</B>
   <UL>  Colonel Stern appears to be a woman in her mid-forties.  She is a blond and her hair is cut short, though she has often sported a pony tail.   She has an athletic build and is very fit.  Every morning she exercises for 30 minutes, and runs 10km several times a week if her schedule permits.  <P>

Cori's appearance has always been very important to her. When she was 16 she had her body biosculpted to improve her appearance.  She started taking anagathics more as a way to say young looking rather than an attempt to live for ever, though she has come to value the longevity.  She started taking anagathics at the age of 18.  The drugs kept her looking 18 until she lost her supply while working as a StarMerc on Promise. This youthful appearance did have its downside: other soldiers often had a hard time believing that this apparent teenager was a high decorated Marine officer.  Though it did come in useful while working behind enemy lines for the exact same reason.     <P>

She is terrified of the effects prolonged use of anagathics has on the body and has had to have several growths removed so far.  She is dreading the day a major mutation occurs.  The times she has spent without anagathics has effected her, she has been able to overcome some of the physical effects, but her mental reflexes have degraded, and she doesn't think quite as well as she did when she was young.  She understands this and hates it but can not think of anything to do about it.   Her memory also isn't as good as it once was.  She doesn't have alzheimer disease or anything that severe, its just that 100 years of life is a lot to remember.  <P>

<UL><B>Possessions:</B> 
<UL>Col. Stern owns a large variety of military equipment including a relic TL-15 suit of combat armor.  In combat she favors gauss rifles.  She also carries a back up 9mm magnum autopistol.  She lost her original Marine cutlass when she was captured by the robots on Promise, but since then she managed to find another.  She carries this with her at all times and is very reluctant to give it up, though she is willing to do so if a security situation requires it.  For instance she was not allowed to carry it while meeting with Secretary General Maggart.  She found the body guards reaction amusing, since she is more deadly with her bare hands than she is with the cutlass.  
<P>
She has had all of her decorations and commendations remade since loosing the originals on Promise.  She knows they are copies, but it still feels good to have them, as a reminder of the past.  She doesn't have much spare cash on hand, most of her money has gone into the Battle Angels and into her eternal hunt for anagathics.  Like all of the Battle Angels she wears military fatigues while on duty.  The Battle Angels use Imperial rank insignia.

<UL><B>Contacts:</B>
<UL>
Most of her contacts with the Imperial marines are dead, though a few are still left alive in the Regency, though they are all old men.  Of course she doesn't know that the Regency survives and they don't know that she survived.  Her contacts established on Promise are all dead, as no one lives to an old age on that planet.  She knows quite a few Far Traders and is well liked in those areas.  She knows a few Guild members and though she doesn't agree with their philosophy, she found most of them to be upright people.  She doesn't like the influence the Slavers have had on the Guild and fears that it will lead to trouble.  Since arriving in the Dawn League she has become well known to the RC military forces, first as an unarmed combat instructor on Aubaine and later as a competent Free Lancer.  She and the Battle Angels have taken on several jobs for the Reformation Coalition and will likely take on more in the future.
