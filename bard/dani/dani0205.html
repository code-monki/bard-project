<UL><B>Background:</B>
   <UL>
 Background:  Born on 321/804 on the world of Skya (0411 / Daibei) Maria Ulianov
developed a rare and untreatable genetic condition at an early age.  Assured by
prominent researchers at the University of Wariner that a cure was only a few years
away Marias parents decided to place her in a low-berth in the Universities vault
and await a cure.  Nearly five decades passed and as the possibilities of a cure
grew increasingly distant, Marias family, desperate that their daughter should
know them once more, decided to remove her from the Universities low-berth vault
and journey with her to the planet Ghost (3115 / Reavers Deep) in search of a
reported miracle cure.<p>
 Though the trip from Wariner to Ghost was short it was not uneventful as a massive
failure of the ships Jump Drive caused a leak of Jump Space Energies into the
starship killing much of the crew and many of the passengers.  Those who managed to
survive were forced to seek refuge from these energies in the ships emergency
low-berths.  Though the low-berths provided a measure of protection against these
energies they could not completely insulate their occupants from the effects of a
syndrome commonly known as Jump Space Psychosis.  A trip that was supposed to be
over in less than three months would take sixty-eight years to complete when the
ship was found drifting slowly though the outer reaches of the St. George (2616 /
Reavers Deep) system.  Marias parents were not among the survivors.
<p>
 Over the next dozen years the Ayanshi of Ghost would treat and cure Marias
genetic condition, educate her and eventually send her off for further education
with the Imperial Scout Service on Wariner.  She served with the Imperial Scout
Service for four years charting the regions around the Great Rift, when her ship
disappeared under mysterious circumstances.<p>
 Though the cause of the accident was never fully explained, times being what they
were when the ships was discovered, no one had the resources to devote to a proper
investigation.  The years in low-berths had taken their toll both physically and
mentally on Maria.  Another one hundred and eighty two years had passed before the
remains of Marias scout ship and its four occupants were found in a slowly
deteriorating orbit about Poras (2528 / Zarushagar) third gas giant.  The final
war had been in full swing for six long years and the thousand year old Imperium
was quickly coming apart at the seams.<p>
 Maria returned to Ghost for further treatment, including the loss of sight in both
eyes and the loss of her right arm from just above the elbow.  Maria finished her
schooling at the University on Wariner before Ghosts Oracle, Mrina Ptal, ordered
the dispatch of three Ayanshi starships on missions of utmost secrecy.  Maria was
to be the Astrogator and human relations advisor on the second of those ships, the
Ryvik.<p>
 Seventy-three years later the Ryvik would be found in apparently good working
order, drifting slowly through the Agiruur (3036 / Diaspora) system.

<UL><B>Appearance:</B>
   <UL>
 With her carefully layered platinum blond hair, chrome cybernetic eyes
and long angular frame Marias presence can best described as eerie.  At one time
Maria would have been considered pain, almost boring in appearance.  However, the
genetic tampering she endured at the hands of Imperial Scientists, coupled with the
careful, artistic, manipulations of the Ayanshi have produced a strikingly
attractive woman.
 Maria is usually dressed in a basic black body sleeve covered by an Imperial Scout
Service flight jacket with Federation of Daibei markings topped by the Reformation
Coalition insignia.  On formal occasions she usually dresses a conservatively cut
black dress accented with expensive yet tastefully designed Ayansh'i jewelry.  On
these occasions she has a pair of green contacts she wears to soften the impact of
her chromed eyes, plus her jewelry is carefully coordinated to match with the
contacts.
   </UL>
</UL>
<UL><B>Personality:</B>
   <UL>
 Spending much of her adult life in an out of low-berths has had a
profound effect on Marias personality.  She has witnessed so many changes in the
universe that nothing seems to phase her any more and interpersonal relationships
are difficult at best as she believes shes destined to end up trapped in a
low-berth again.  Maria suffers from a kind of survivors guilt that many remnants
are familiar with and she blames herself for much of the destruction she has
witnessed, though these events were clearly beyond her control.
 Marias motions are minimalistic at best, carefully calculate to achieve the
maximum effect with a minimum of effort.  This, coupled with an almost complete
lack of visible body language, lends and almost machine like air about her
actions.  Her personality is perhaps best summed up as quiet and thoughtful.

   </UL>
</UL>
<UL><B>Motivation:</B>
 <UL>
 Marias motivations are deeply rooted in her strong connection to the past, though
she has little use for people who glorify the 3rd Imperium as she witnessed many of
its deepest hypocrisies first hand, though she continues finds comfort in the
memories of the people she once knew there.  She rationalizes that Any society so
bent upon destroying itself and the lives of its peoples was not worth saving in
the first place.  Maria feels a profound sense of loss for many of the good and
noble individuals who she once knew in the Federation of Daibei, but she realizes
that the basic human decency of those people still lives on in the ideas of this
new place she calls home.<p>
 Maria witnessed several of Ililek Kuligaans speeches on Wariner in 1124 and
possesses a deep seated desire to meet and thank him for his words.
<p>

   <I>Heart King:</I>
 Honorable- Lt. Commander Ulianov has witnessed the hypocrisy of the Third
Imperium first hand an despises it and everything it ever stood for.  The Leaders
of the Imperium abandoned their people in a selfish quest for power allowing them
to die by the trillions.  She knows first hand of the rampant paranoia that fueled
the Psionic Suppressions and the devastating effects that those suppressions had on
her family.  Maria made a pact before she left Ghost to always remain faithful to
her principles, the people she works with and the society she lives within.  Duke
Craig's policy of defending the people rather than becoming involved in the petty
squabbling of the Third Imperium have left an indelible mark upon her soul and she
will always strive to maintain those ideals.<p>

   </UL>
   <UL><I>Joker:</I>
 Insanity.  Due to her exposure to Jump-Space energy particles, Maria
suffers from a rare psychological condition known as Jump Space Psychosis.  Though
treatable in it's early stages, Maria's psychological problems did not manifest
themselves till many years later, when she was placed in low-berth suspension for
the third time in her life.  While in the low-berth her psychic powers suddenly
activated and she began feeding off the negative emotions and thoughts of those
around her magnifying those emotions a thousand fold.  When she was finally revived
one-hundred and eighty-two years later she was a shivering wreck unable to control
any of her Psionic abilities.  Though she has regained rudimentary control over her
talents every time she's placed in a low-berth the psychotic episodes re-surface.
Aboard an ordinary ship this wouldn't be a problem, but the <i>R'yivk</i> is anything but
an ordinary ship.<p>
   </UL>
</UL>
<UL><B>Refereeing  Maria:</B>
   <UL>
 Maria may be encountered anywhere within the AO along with the
rest of the <i>R'yivk'</i>s crew though they tend to spend most of their time on either
Spires or Aubaine.  Maria has a particularly hard-nosed manner of dealing with
other people, answering questions before they can be asked, and cutting straight to
the point.  This is more of a reflection of her lack of Psionic control and the
frustrations contained there in, on day's where she's more in control of her powers
Maria appears open, friendly and even down right chatty.<p>

 Due to a number of historical reference texts and classified Imperial documents
placed in her sub-dermal TL-15 computer system Maria possesses an in ordinate
amount of information relating to the pre-collapse installations and facilities
through out the Old Expanses, Diaspora and the coreward regions of Alpha Leonis.
Though much of this information is nearly a century old it has served her well as
bargaining chip in her negotiations with member worlds of the Reformation
Coalition.<p>

</UL>

<UL><b>Bringing Maria into play</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li> The player characters can be involved Operation Crystal Garden, the operation
involving the recovery of the <i>R'yivk</i>.  Players introduced to Maria are likely to
become close friends with other members of the temporally displaced crew.
<p>
<li> The player's are recruited by or assigned to Maria as part of a large scale
survey mission taking place on Nicosia.  This mission is likely to involve several
starships and has the potentiality to involve an orbital SAG against the Australian
Empire.
<p>
<li> Due to her hatred of individuals who make a living feeding off the suffering of
others, Maria has hired the PC's to carefully track the motions of a number of
Harknotten trust starships.  It is her desire to expose these vessels as pirates or
slavers leading to their eventual seizure by Reformation Coalition authorities.
<p>
<li> The player's are hired to establish a relationship with a potentially friendly
government on ? this relationship is intended to provided the Reformation Coalition
access to a pre-collapse storage facility Maria believes exists within that
countries borders in exchange for technical knowledge and assistance.  The validity
of Maria's information is entirely at the Referee's discretion.<p>
<p>

</ul>
</ul>
<UL><B>Possesions:</B>
<ul> Maria is rather spartan in her trappings holding on to only a
Federation of Daibei duty beret, a TL-14 gauss pistol and a handful of momento's
gathered during a life time of traveling.  Maria's most prized possessions are a
pair of letters signed by the Oracle of Ghost and Duke Craig of Daibei
respectively.

</UL>
</UL>

<UL><B>Quotes:</B>
 
<ul><i> Those idiotic old farts at the remnants society are obviously reminiscing about a
different Third Imperium than the one I grew up in.</i><p>
<i> Actually, traveling in the wilds is a lot easier than it used to be.</i><p>
 <i> I'm old enough to know better but young enough not to give a damn.</i><p>
 <i> Margaret??  What the hell's the matter with you people?  Margaret was a heartless
bitch, more interested in the profit margins at Turkera Lines than the welfare of
her people.  Ask the Genoee what kind of a woman Margaret was.</i><p>
 <i> Home, ya I can remember it, a place filled with bad memories and good people.</i><p>
 <i> Kuligaan?  He's still alive?  Holy crap, I guess it's true what they say about
only the good dying young.  I remember watching him on Wariner, so full of passion
and fire...</i><p>

 None, Maria has outlived all of her contemporaries and hasn't had to opportunity
to establish any new relationships.

  </UL>
</UL>
<UL><B>Notes:</B>
   <UL>
 Though not a member of any Reformation Coalition organization, Maria has picked up
a number of Tac-Codes from her interaction with RC personnel.  She is most commonly
known as Fem-bot but is also referred to as Jonah.<p>
 Marias right arm is a vat grown replacement, as such it is completely
indistinguishable from the original.<p>
 Marias TL15 data jack is concealed beneath her hair at the base of her skull.
Marias sub-dermal computer is not wired into her brain and instead responds to an
older, point and click, kind of interface.  The stylus tablet is a false thumb nail
on her right hand and she clicks by tapping her fingers together.<p>
 Though the PCs are unlikely to figure this, out Maria is really a genetically
tailored clone.  The real Maria died shortly after her arrival on Ghost in 924.<p>
