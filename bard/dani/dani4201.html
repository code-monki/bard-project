   NOTE TO REFEREE: the Queen will NOT openly discuss  her  psionic
   powers,  or  the psionic powers of the ruling Digamu aristocracy.
   The Digamu has had connections with the Zhodani Consulate  for  a
   long  tome, streching back to 502.  This psionic order arrived at
   Persephone at 603 as Naminalus pilgrims, and stayed. By 720  they
   were  the  ruling  elite, but when the Psionic Suppression hit in
   800, they offically gave up their psionics.
      <p>
   Well, they kept it, but "under wraps", and mainly  in  connection
   with  their religion. Much of the nobility eventually Mora (Mora:
   Spinward Marches 3124 A99AB7-F). They never fully revealed  their
   family connections to the Consulate, though. They 'kept in touch'
   with Zhodani family members back in the Far Frontiers sector (the
   zhodane  "Afachiabr  Sector"), though always discreetly and never
   seriously treasonous...except in 'flexing' a few  laws  here  and
   there.
      <p>
   Even after the Psionic Suppressions were repealed in the  1140's,
   they  did  not "come out of the closet". They remain quite secretive
   about their psionic powers; although the Regency Govt. knows
   about it, they rather aviod the general public knowing. And their
   family connections to  the  Zhodani  Consulate  is  a  deep  deep
   secret.
      <p>

 Born at 1158 to King Shi (at age 62) and Concubine
   Agiigugig  Raised  as the Heiress to the Crown, under a regent (King
   Shi died in 1167) Crowned Queen at 1179; married that same year


      <p>
   Queen Ashki is a good example of how a minor noble can dominate a
   subsector, if the political enviroment permits it.
      <p>
   At 1179, Ashki inherited a bankrupt government from  her  father,
   King  Shi  (1194  -  1179). For centuries Gekashiishaa, a ancient
   form of Vilani communism (it originated at Diaspora, at -7200
   Imperial), worked well on Persephone.
      <p>
   The unexpected loss of Glisten slashed
   revenue  to  Persephone,  and  the enormous bureaucracy failed to
   react quickly or creatively enough to avoid the long-term
   consequences.
      <p>
   At 1179, Ashki became Queen  of  Persephone.  Two  months  later,
   Persephone's  four  main creditors arrived at her palace for
   discussions on debt servicing. But, Persephone could  give  no  more
   without  threatening  the  very stability of her society, and the
   Crown itself. So she recieved an ultimatum:
      <p>
   "Turn over the administration of your government to us" [Give  us
   your  crown]  or "Slash social spending." [And face the planetary
   equivelant of the Rebellion and Collapse] or "Declare  bankrupcy"
   [And  have  your  crown  stripped  from  you by the Archduke, for
   dereliction of Duty.]
      <p>
   Queen Ashki choose to end social spending, but in a way that kept
   her crown on her head.
      <p>
   Basically, she maneouvered the political situation  so  that  not
   only  did  her  political and ideological enemies, the leaders of
   the Old Order, recieved the blame for the financial crunch,  they
   also had to publicly sign the documents that ended the old system
   of Gekashiishaa. Moreover, in a stunning  move,  the  Queen  held
   them personally liable for the debt, and confisitated all their
   property and wealth to pay for it. All this at the tender age  of
   21.
      <p>
   After destroying the Old Order - by  implication,  but  never  by
   openly  challenging  it  - Queen Ashki began to establish her New
   Order - again by her actions, rather than proclimation.
      <p>
   She surrounded herself with wealthy, aggressive young  men  who's
   destiny  she  controlled  with steel smiles and velvet words. The
   priests who she favoured did not  wish  to  perfect  their  inner
   faith,  like  the old establishment wanted. The "New Balance"
   required the conversion of offworlders, rather than  "keeping  your
   own life clean next to the spiritually dying, crying out for help
   and Balance in their lives".
      <p>
   Those who suffered the most in the nameless New Order were mocked
   and  attacked  ruthlessly  if they dared complain.  Very few even
   understoon what was going on, as the situation was  so  novel  in
   their 770 year history that their wasn't even a name for it, or a
   word to describe it. Those that did understood could do  nothing:
   their leadership was disgraced, their ideology in ruins.
      <p>
   By 1190 the economy was finally recovering.  With  the  death  of
   Gekashiishaa  a  new,  vigourous society was being born.  In this
   society freedom reined, with one limit: never challange  the
   elite, the Digamu. The drive of this society was for raw, unlimited
   wealth and power, cloaked/limited by an extreme piety to the High
   God  and  His Balance. Anyone could rise as high as they can, but
   if you fall, not a hand will be given in aid. A lot  better  than
   the  old  100% income taxes. A lot crueler than the excellent old
   health care system, free to all.
      <p>
   At 1193, Queen Ashki again sent a political earthquake throughout
   Persephone, when she sent out most of Persephone's 70 million-man
   army to fight on Florine (District  268:  Spinward  Marches/1533,
   D312975-A), a balklanized world on the edge of the Aslan New Lord
   territories. Currently, Florine is involved in a bitter civil war
   with pro-Aslan, pro-Regency, and pro-Independent fractions (among
   others). The decision to send Persephone troops under the Imperial
   Banner to war electrified the planet at the time, providing a
   potent kick of patriotism. The troops are still  there,  but  now
   mainly as garrison troops.
      <p>
   This is the first time that Persephone's army has fought (in
   anything  tougher  than  police actions) in 360 years and the first
   time that the Army has left the subsector.
      <p>
   From 1195, the Queen, now sure of herself  in  the  interstellar
   sphere, began to promote Persephone interests throughout the
   subsector. Diplomats and missionaries have been sent as far  as  the
   Consulate and the coreward Vargr states. Several major deals with
   large subsector corporations are turning Persephone into a hub of
   industry and activity. Her Royal Majesty is promoting large
   families, to increase population and become a major contender for the
   title of subsector capital.
      <p>
   The Queen feels that the greatest limitation to future Persephone
   greatness  is  tech  level  limitations and the fact that Glisten
   (Glisten:  Spinward  Marches/2036  A000986-F)  remains  in  Aslan
   hands, limiting commerce through Persephone.  To remedy this, she
   is openly courting TL B and C companies to shift their operations
   to  Persephone,  via tax breaks, stressing the lack of trade laws
   and regulations of any kind, and the low,  low  wages  that
   Persephonians  are willing to accept. Slowly but surely, interest is
   picking up. She is certain that a  "Critical  point"  is  nearing
   that  will  change  Persephone  forever as a flood of 'high-tech'
   companies move in.
      <p>
   As for Glisten, she is pulling strings in both Naval circles  and
   at  the  Archduke's  palace to create a naval base at Persephone.
   She is also stressing the critical political and geopolicial
   importance  of reconquering Glisten. As for Virus, we all know that
   Virus has died out back in the wilds, now don't  we?  This  ain't
   1130, after all.
      <p>
   This year (1200), she has just bought four  TL-B, 350-ton traders to
   handle  increasing traffic. The new starport will be ready within
   the year. And the  Naminolus  religion  is  spreading  throughout
   Strouden.  The  only  fly in the bottle remains the new subsector
   governor, Subsector Governor Anthony E.  Prentice-Hall,  who
   attempts  to stymie her every move. He endlessly proclaimes, in
   his nasal whine, that Persephone is upsetting  the  entire  subsector
   economy,  with the possibility of a major economic shift in power
   and economic consequences which no one can forsee or control.
      <p>
   In subsector affairs, she has increasingly  sided  with  Strouden
   (Lunion:  Spinward Marches/2327 A745988-D) against Adabicci
   (Lunion: Spinward Marches/1824 A571896B-B) and the subsector  capital
   of  Lunion  (Lunion:  Spinward  Marches 2124 A995984-D). This
   increasing acrimony is dividing the subsector  into  two  competing
   blocks,  and massive girdlock in the subsector government houses.
   The subsector Duke is attempting to calm the subsector with
   ineffectual meetings and soothing words, but "It ain't working".
      <p>
   Among her other drives, she is attempting to persuade the  sector
   nobility to help her convince the Archduke to declare himself
   Emperor. She feels that this would give a strong boost to the
   fortunes  of  the Nobility, and promote the drive to reunify the
   Empire. Both "Good Things" from her perspective.
      <p>
   She is angling for a promotion, eventually as Duchess of
   Persephone Subsector, but right now as Countess of Ushama.  As
   Countess, she would have authority over nearby Penkwar (Lunian:
   Spinward  Marches/2128  X978000-0)  and  Harvosette (Lunian: Spinward
   Marches/2129 C330737-9). Harvosette are of the  same  culture  as
   Persephone - Ushama  and  have the same system of rule; Harvosette
   was a colony of Persephone from the 870's to the 960's.
   Of course, only the Emperor can grand new noble patents... but
   maybe Regents can do so, too. Queen Ashki is trying out both avenues.
   <p>
   Finally, as Champion of the Widows, she is  involved  in  several
   major charities throughout the subsector. She also promotes
   several events, both throughout the subsector and on  Persephone,
   to bring the plight of widows (and widowers) to public attention.
