<FONT SIZE=6><B>Crew of the RCS <I>Hornet</I></B></FONT><BR>

</CENTER><p>
<HR>

   The <I>Hornet</I> and its crew were described in the two TNE Novels: <cite>Death of Wisdom</I> and <cite>To Dream of Chaos</cite> by Paul Brunette. This is my best guess at their capabilities and character.  They certainly have additional skills and abilities, so feel free to add what you think is appropriate.  If in doubt consult the NPC templates in the TNE rulebook, in fact that is where Newton's skill assortment came from.
<P>
The RCS <I>Hornet</I> is an 80 year old <I>Jayhawk</I> Far Trader, rehabilitated by the Hiver Technical
   Academy as a class project. It is owned by the Hiver technical nest, but registered as an RCS auxiliary vessel.
   The standard <I>Jayhawk</I> is not very durable and the Hiver Technical Academy added a few features to the ship to increase its lifespan.  A missile turret and a standard TL-14 Laser Turret have been added. There is also a single TL-14 MFD which the weapons share. Almost all the sensors, communicators and electronics have been replaced with TL-14 versions imported from the Hive Federation.  Its cargo bay has been modified to include a 10-ton collapsible fuel bladder and a 20-ton standard module pod bay.  On its second mission a Gatling gun and a 12 MJ plasma gun were added for  fire support.  The ship's motto is "Cave Aculem", which is ancient Latin for "Beware the Sting." This motto is emblazoned on the ship's crest, which shows the RC logo along with a Terran Hornet in flight, with the ship's name and tail number: 10161.
   <P>
      RCES Admiralty sees the <I>Hornet</I> as a backup to the other more capable ships in the fleet.  Since RCES forces are stretched so thin, it often gets thrown into situations beyond what it was designed for.

   <H3>Crew of the RCS Hornet</H3>

   <B> Couer "Red Sun" d'Esprit </B> - Captain -
   Born on Terra in the Phoenix Arcology of Arizona in the year 1095, she grew up dreaming of the starships and in 1113 joined the  Imperial Scout Service. During the Rebellion she continued to serve in the Imperial fleet, even when that transferred to Lucan's control. She served aboard the scout cruiser <I>Alnitak</I>, attached to the Navy.
   While on a mission to summon reinforcements, the ship was attacked and heavily damaged by elements of the
   Solomani Navy.  With all the senior command crew killed, and faced with certain
   defeat she ordered the ship to jump, even though it was well within the
   gravity well of a gas giant.  The ship misjumped and ended up in hex 0538 of Nicosia Subsector. Couer ordered the crew in to low berths. In 1198 they were rescued
   by  the Dawn League ship the <I>Ashtabula</I>. Only she and three other crew members survived.
   She offered her services to the Dawn League and served as pilot of the
   DLS <I>Lirgishkhunan</I>. She then became an instructor at the
   Technical Academy.  She enjoyed that, but still yearned for a shipboard duty.
   Finally she was offered command of the RCS <I>Hornet</I>.  She got the taccode Red Sun from the Imperial starburst on the Scout uniform she was wearing when recovered from low berth.
   She is a tall woman (175cm) with shoulder length brown hair.  Her biological age is 31.  She doesn't think much of the former Imperium, it was based on conquest and killing and didn't respond tot he people.  She strongly approves of the Coalitions goals, and that it is based on democratic principles.

   <B>Dr Orit "Physic" Takagawa </B> - Ship's Doctor -  A native Aubaini she was Courer's roommate on Aubaine, before being selected to join the <I>Hornet</I> as the ship's doctor.  Orit is a trained surgeon and xeno-pathologist.  She is estranged from her husband August Deleparo, chairman of Novastar Inc. who was recently convicted of treason against the Coalition.  A short dusky woman , with black eyes and a grown-out pageboy haircut, she is quite photogenic.   She is a bit gabby, and will tend to fill any quiet spaces with meaningless chatter.

   <B>Johanna "Gyro" Solomon</B> - Laser Gunner/XO  - Johanna possesses a strong stocky body with lively blue eyes and short blonde hair bleached almost white by Aubaine's sun.   She was in Couer's last tactical class at the Technical Academy, where she impressed Couer with her abilities.  She was the top rated gunner in the class of 1201. She has some engineering skills and often assists Crowbar (the engineer) with the jump engines.  She is only 22, but was given the XO job anyway.  The captain would have rather given the job to Crowbar or Deep Six, but Crowbar is too busy, and Deep Six has limited mobility with his wheelchair.

   <B>Denise  "Snapshot" Valencia</B> - Missile Gunner - A native of Oriflamme where she excelled at her classes she transferred to Aubaine for her post-graduate studies.
She was in Couer's last tactical classes at the Technical Academy, and was the
second best gunner behind Johanna Solomon. She possess a short temper which
often gets her into trouble. During her time at the academy she amassed a large
number of demerits. She is quite sensitive about anti-Oriflamme remarks, often
the only thing stopping arguments about Oriflamme politics from erupting is the Captain's
prohibition against discussing politics aboard the ship. Her
hair is short, wavy and   red, which complements her brown eyes.
She is 22 years old, and the Hornet is her first starship.

   <B>Glaive "Crowbar"</B> - Engineer - Crowbar as he is always called served as a Freelancer before enrolling in the Technical Academy.  He is tall (188cm) and has a thick scraggly black beard.  He is quite experienced and nows his way around Wilds worlds.  Couer thought about making him her XO, but she figured he had enough work to do without the added responsibilities.

   <B>AkakEE "Deep Six" Siltriver</B> - Astrogator - AkakEE is a  deep water Schali native to Aubaini.  He is fairly modest and doesn't speak up very much, except while drunk, then he grows even more melancholy than normal.    His drink of choice is ee'kwat, fermented algae, though the captain has forbidden him to drink any of it while on board, after a drunken episode where he collapsed.  He gets around in a Schalli wheelchair, which greatly limits his mobility. AkakEE is a non-native Anglic speaker, but he is trying to expand his use of Anglic slangs and idioms; this often comes across in slightly amusing ways.

   <B>Cicero "Scissor"</B> Hiver Advisor - Scissor died from Fologorex II, a Solomani created biological weapon, on the <I>Hornet</I>'s first mission.  It was an expert technician.  It often engaged in petty manipulation, as is the want of Hivers everywhere.

The <I>Hornet</I> often needs more than a standard crew for its missions, and a squad of Aubaini Marines has served aboard on several occasions.  They work well with the crew, and are the first choice for ship board troops.  They are armed with gauss rifles and Coalition Battle Dress.
<P>

<B>Sgt Major Vin "Drop Kick" Escher</B>  Ranking Marine -  Drop Kick is from Detachment A
of the 3rd Marine Armored Battalion. Born on Aubaine he has served
three terms in the Marines. A muscular man with a big frame, he barely fits in
his Phyruss Grav Sled. He is not a very big fan of Oriflamme political
policy. It is thus ironic that he has started to date the Oriflammi Snapshot.
