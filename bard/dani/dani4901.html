<UL><B>Background:</B>
   <UL>

   Despite his degenerate existance, this particular blight on
   mankind  is quite competent on the job.  He is an extremely tough
   examiner - on both first timers, and those renewing their license  to
   fly - who enjoys depriving young hotshot pilots of their starship
   pilot license for the most trivial of reasons.
   <P>
   He is also quite devioius in his methods: one  of  his  favourate
   tricks is to fail the pilot, then suggest that "for the right
   incentive" he's willing to reconsider the grade.  After  the  bribe
   is  given,  he  blows  the  whistle, the pilot is imprisioned and
   barred from ever regaining his  license  while  Longshanks  gains
   brownie points and an extra bonus in his paycheck.
   <P>
   While he's willing to stomp on anyone,  he  especially  loves  to
   fail  psions,  as  they remind him of the Zhodani, those "Craven,
   perverted mind-eating moon-worshippers"  Originally born  in  the
   Consulate, (he regularily thanks the gods for getting him out
   before the age of 4, where his his old homeworld "Sheyou", and  is
   willing  to  do anything to hurt the Zhodani, psions, or anything
   related to them.
   <P>
   Behind this tub of lard's beady little eyes lies a beady but
   hyperactive mind.  Treat with caution.
