<UL><B>Background:</B>
   <UL>
Marco Knight was born to a upper middle class family on Aurora.
Both of his parents were technicians and Marco spent his childhood
immersed in technology.  He discovered he had a real knack for
technology, too.  At 14, Marco and his friend Pers Tarvis built a
grav racer and entered it in the Adrian Open.  They didn't win that
year, but they did two years later!<P>

At university, Marco majored in Starship Architecture.  It looked
like his career would be designing ships at one of the new yards
being built on Aurora, but a summer job as a space hand on the
<I>Rarrock Walk</I> changed his life.<P>

Aboard the <I>Walk</I> Marco discovered he absolutely *loved* getting his
hands dirty in the Engine Room.  Sitting at a computer terminal
designing a ship couldn't compete with actually being there. 
<P>
After graduating, Marco was hired by the Piasia Line out of Aubaine.
He quickly received a commission and settled into the life of an
Engineering Officer.  Marco was technically very good.  He picked up
the skills he needed and advanced in rank quickly as Piasia expanded
operations throughout the Coalition.
<P>
Over the last 20 years, Marco has visited most of the Coalition
worlds, and a few worlds outside as well.  He has picked up a number
skills that have served him well.  Marco knows his isn't a great
gambler, but he can hold his own; he isn't a great trader, but he
has pulled off a number of lucrative deals; he's no soldier, but he
has saved his life with gun, knife and bare hands more than once.<P>

<UL><B>Appearance:</B>
   <UL> 
Marco Knight is slightly below average height, but solidly built.
The first thing you notice about him is his flaming red hair, cut
short and merging with his trim beard.  Today Marco's hair and beard
are beginning to streak with grey, but the effect of the grey with
the red is striking.  Marco has dark blue eyes with laugh lines
around them that match the almost constant smile on his face.

<UL><B>Personality:</B>
   <UL> 
Although Marco is a friendly man and easy to get along with most of
the time he never made many deep friendships while serving with the
Piasia Line.  He always spent most of his time tinkering with the
equipment in the Engine Rooms of the ships on which he has served,
so most of the crew never got to know him well.  Those that did
liked him and those that worked for him in Engineering respected
him.
  
It isn't his nature, but Knight is a little bitter today.  He was
totally caught off guard when Piasia Lines released him, and is more
than a little angry about it.  Marco really likes working with
starship engines and equipment, and can't imagine doing something
else.  He is anxious to get a position and back into space, but he
really wants a situation where he can't just be summarily dumped
again.  If he can buy into a small merchant ship he will do it.
