   <UL>
 Background:
 Born 2/IX/1160 on Zaldus Island, Vras.  Upon recieving his masters
degree in marketing in 1185, he took a position as a junior executive at his
family's company. After failing to recieve a promotion, he went back for his
doctorate and upon success in that returned to the family business.  He
rapidly rose to VP of marketing.  Upon his release of the Zaldus family high
technology vaults, he gained the funds necessary to create the Zaldus
Corporation.  Rumors persist that Zaldus is sitting on more high technology
but a cursory search by Aubaini authorities found nothing.<p>
   He is married and has 3 children.<p>

</UL>

<UL><B>Motivation:</B>
 <UL>
 Zaldus whole life has been centered on the fortunes of his family
company.  He has let himself be led by enthusiasm only once in his life and
that ended in failure.  He got swept up in the euphoria following contact w/
the Hivers and rashly invested in DLS Aurora.  Rather than go into the rage
that swept the Dawn League following the loss of the 12 Traders, he was more
coldly calculating than ever.<p>

   <I>Club Ace:</I>
 Though not trained in personal combat beyond a fancy to slug
pistols he gained as a junior executive (and has funded several custom models
for himself), he expects nothing less than fierce loyalty from his employees.
He has a dark streak in his attitudes towards competitors, enemies, and
obstacles to his continued success and is both merciless and severe in
response.  <p>

   </UL>
   <UL><I>Diamond 6:</I>
 He has a driving need to exceep the historic fortunes of his
family.  He will go to extraordinary means to drive his corporations interests
into high technology and space assets.<p>
