Essentially, this is a "Culture Clash" article,
on Vilani converts to Ismya Christianity.  It's an attempt
to 'get into' the Vilani mind, and see what things would
a Vilani find attractive about such an uncompromising
religion, what things are rather distasteful, and what
things are just plain weird and incomprehensible to
the Vilani mind.
<P>
Of course, it goes without saying that the Vilani
converting to Christianity are usually marginal members
of the Vilani community, anyway's: 'converting' means
change, the greatest possible perversion in most
Vilani thought.  On the other hand, those disgustingly
innovative Terrans did win the Interstellar Wars, and did
dominate the government of the Second and Third Imperia:
maybe their spirituality was actually somehow more older,
more in tune with The Way Things Should Be than Vilani
faiths?   Vilani thinking may change very slowly, but
it does change....

<h3> Origins: Spread of the Faith</h3>
One of the more intertesting future developments is the spread
of the Ismya Faith, as a seperate force from the Ogadzi race.  For
most of history, Ismya Christianity was an ethnic religion: offically
it applied to all humans, but in reality the Ogadzi kept it to
themselves.
<P>
However, with the rise of the Ogadzi Diaspora, this started to
change.   First, the Ogadzi - unwilling to hide in their enclaves
forever - started to openly interact with the society surrounding
them.  Finding the local cultures abhorrent, they promptly
started trying to change it, from establishing charities to sending
out missionaries.   Because of their unfortunate experiences with
State power (both on Tyrannus and in the Diaspora), they placed
a low  priority on political lobbying or governmental subsidies &
preferences: they instead worked to build an entire alternative
society from the bottom up, with it's foundation in the supremacy
of the Christian God, rather than membership in the Ogadzi race.
<P>
While many are willing to use the charitable services provided, only
a few has actually converted to the Faith.  However, the new Ismya
outlook is already shaping Diaspora intellectual thought, and - as
Ogadzi wealth is invested in wealth-generating projects, instead of
non-productive things like guns and bombs and bunkers - are also
growing in influence economically as well.  Of course, economic
power brings out jealousies, as well as political pull.
<h3> Ismya Christianity and the Vilani</h3

Here, the term "Vilani" includes both cultural and racial members.
Interestingly the Diasporan Vilani - of all people - look to be the
most likely to start formally joining the Ismya faith.
<P>
"So you're saying that there is this invisible, all-powerful ruler -
something like the Shadow-Emperors - who rules all the stars.
He never changes, his law never changes, and he fixes the destiny
of everyone before they are born.  And he understands the
occasional need for killing  all of the enemy, and enslaving
those who refuse to pay their financial debts.
<P>
Are you sure that this is a Solomani God?"
 - Ligu Shushakakhan, Vilani community leader,
 Erobi/Diaspora
<P>
The Vilani have never liked changing anything, but they've
been known to make some alterations, if placed under immense
pressure.  In general, the Vilani prefer to obey the rituals and
worship the ancestors as they have done for millennia, and never
cared to change the basic beliefs.  After all, religions and ideologies
define the very essence of what a culture is, after all: to change
 that  is to change everything.
<P>
The Vilani are generally turned off by Solomani religions & most
of their ideologies: too moralistic, too unstable, too idealistic,
too individualistic, too much of a radical change of what they
have always done.  They want something practical, something old
beyond imagining, something with a rich heritage of ritual and
ceremony.
<P>
The closest Solomani religion that fits the bill is Vilani Rite Imperial
Catholicism.  With a mix of Catholic and Vilani writings, rituals, and
theologies, it's usually the only Solomani religion the Vilani are even
willing to consider converting to.
<P>
The Vilani have never cared about whether something is right or wrong,
just on if it's efficent or wasteful, traditional or innovative.   What the
Ismya missionaries insist is that doing what is right, in the long term,
gives wealth and power to those who do it: slowly but surely in current
history, and also in eternity as the Children of God rule for all time.
<P>
Moreover, doing what is right is traditional, following the laws God
wrote first in the fabric of creation, then more clearly in the ancient
writings of the Bible, especially Moses.  All the traditions of men
are mere corruptions and self-deceptions, compared to the First
Traditions which, naturally, originate from Terra.  The Ogadzi
missionaries cheerefully point out that even the tiny tribe that gave
us these traditions from God still endure as a sign, while much more
powerful and dominant nations has faded into the dust.
<P>
The Vilani are quite comfortable with multi-generational planning,
and admire the protections the Pentateuch gives to property.
They are uncomfortable with "The same law shall apply to
the native as to the stranger who sojurns among you" (Ex. 12:49),
as the Vilani like to discriminate on the basis of culture: still,
as the Law allows only believers to hold judicial, executive and
legislative positions in government, it isn't too bad.  And you
don't get a more stable law code than the Moasic: the last revisions
were done 5700 years ago, and it's heretical to modify what now exists.
(The Vilani, of course, just adore stability.)
<P>
The Vilani are used to bureaucratic orders, to always ask permission
before they do anything.  With the Mosaic code, as long as you obey
the known, unchanging law you can do whatever you want, including
set up your own bureaucracy and organizations, to manage your own
affairs.  Such a possibility greatly appeals to all Vilani, especially the
more aggressive and dominant Vilani in society.
<P>
The Ismya religion requires belief in a recent creation, something
that the Vilani have no great problems with.   Every Vilani has their
favourite list of things that Those Disgusting Scientific Researchers
Got Wrong, and it wouldn't surprise them in the least if they got the
origin of the universe wrong, as well.  As always, the Tradition come
first - and if they are going to follow the Christian traditions, then they
might as well follow the oldest Christian traditions there is.
<P>
The pro-Ismya Vilani are fairly comfortable in changing Vilani traditions:
the things that they believe are fixed for all time is Divine traditions,
also known as the Law.  For example, they would say that...
<P>
"For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of
men..." Mark 7:8a
<P>
...illustrates the place of Divine Law as a better Universal
Standard than the Vilani culture of the Ziru Sirka, a "supertradition"
that can be enforced across all human cultures, like the old High
Vilani Culture used to be, but better.  Many Vilani recoil at this
verse, and stop listening right then: others want to know why the
commandments of an unknown God should supersede traditions
that have served the Vilani well for thousands of years.
<P>
What disturbs the Vilani more are verses like Psalms 51:16-17,
<P>
"For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it:
thou delightest not in burnt offering.  The sacrifices of God
are a broken spirit: a broken and contrite heart, O God, thou
wilt not despise."
<P>
Most Vilani don't know what a "broken spirit" is, but don't like the
sound of it at all.  Others can't understand why a spiritual
deity would reject sacrifices: aren't they following the rituals in
the way tradition demands?  The Vilani who most love/fear
this God are busy devouring old writings to find out what the
Christian ancients thought about this command: a few are even
on Terra, looking for rare manuscripts that pre-date the
Interstellar Wars for clues.
<P>
In any case, the first trickle of a flood of converts is just starting
to arrive in 1120.  By 1150 - assuming no great political disaster
strikes - there will be more Vilani believers of Ismya Christianity
than Ogadzi believers: this will have interesting consequences
as the religion expands across the Sector.
