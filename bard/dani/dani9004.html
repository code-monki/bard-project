<H1>Iron Butterflies</H1>

<B>Headquarters:</B> Errogel/Atsah/Deneb and Dophkah/Atsah/Deneb
<P>
<B>Organisational Data:</B> Founded in 1143. A number of free traders in
Atsah Subsector survived the first wave of Vampire attacks in the
late 1130s. Led by a remarkable woman named Kux Harper-Caleva, the
Atsah merchants banded together on their own in an effort to keep
local interstellar trade alive. RQS agents began to assist the group
early in its genesis, and eventually it became a large free trader
collective, and then kingmaker for the entire Vanguard Way.
<P>
The influence of the RQS is found throughout the Iron Butterflies' entire hiearchy.
This explains in large part the division of responsibility between
both Errogel and Dophkah. Unlike the Souk, however, the role of the
"rock" is more supervisory, as the Butterflies have strongly resisted
their excessive control, and because the existence of the Corfinium
Corps gives the Regency a military presence in the trailing part of
the subsector anyway. The collective has largely blue collar origins
anyway, and that work ethic still colors their organisation and
relationship with each other and their homeworlds.
<P>
Despite their homespun appeal, the group has used their near trade
monopoly to leverage the acquisition of many of Atsah's richest
resources. Individual ship captains/owners have purchased most of the
subsectors mines and richest agricultural areas. Through a selective
amount of both economic and military pressure, a growing number of
local warlords have been subordinated to the "Iron Barons", and the
traders now effectively control most of the subsector through both
unseen intermediaries and overt political alliances.  Most of the
Butterflies have used this wealth to enrich themselves, their crews
and their homeworlds of Errogel and Dophkah. Many owners plan to
trade their assets in exchange for factory equipment and newer ships,
and effectively become the subsectors entrepenuerial elite in the
process.
<P>
<h3>Ships</h3>The Iron Butterflies consists of twenty six ships, making them the largest
FTC known to the Regency.

<B>Territory:</B> The Iron Butterflies were originally confined by the
Corvine Corsairs to the spinward half of the Vanguard Way. Following
the expulsion of that group from Corridor by Vampire maruaders in
1153, the Butterflies have slowly expanded their trade throughout the
remainder of Ian Subsector, and have taken some exploratory trade
missions into Strand.
