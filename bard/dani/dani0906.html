<UL><B>History</B>:
<UL>Erik Earhart always dreamed of space, he grew up hearing the stories of
the grand battle fleets of the Third Imperium, of people travelling among
the stars as if they were just a jaunt down the street instead of lightyears
apart.  But as he dreamed he also learned the harsh reality, that the Imperials
had thrown it all away.  For this he hated them.  When Senator MacBaen 
gave his famous "Going back" speech, Erik felt that MacBaen was talking
directly to him, he immedietly went to the nearest recruiters office and
signed up for the fledgling Space Force.  The officers in charage quickly saw
his worth as a technichan and commisioned him and gave him a job  in
the design team.<BR><BR>

He was instrumental in building and testing the first
nuclear rockets that Aurora launched into space.  Every few years he
was given another project to work on and another promotion. But for all
the project he was given, they were always based on Aurora, designing
the tools and ships that others would fly.  Earhart wasn't bitter about
this, he knew that without him, the Navy would never work. But he always
had the dream to fly on a starship as crew, to fly among the stars.  
In 1201, he heard that Assemblyman MacBaen, his hero of yesteryear, was
equiping a ship to explore, the wilds, Earhart decided to follow his
dream, and retired from the Navy and joined up with MacBaen, first overseeing
the overhaul of the <I>Argo</I>, a recovered ship, then as its chief engineer.
Maybe after a few years he would come back home, and design ships for
the next generation of heroes, but for now he was going to walk among
the stars.  <BR><BR>

Earhart was never a good people person, prefering the pefection of mathematics.
He is very uncomfortable around people, often stammering and loosing his
train of thought.  During his time in the navy he was given the call sign Earwig, and he absolutly 
hates it.  If not at work maintaining the <I>Argo</I>, he will be tinkering 
in the workshop he has set up in his stateroom..  <BR><BR>

Earhart has slightly balding grey hair, and is fairly stocky.  He doesn't
take great pains with his appearence, but is always presentable.
