</UL>

<UL><B>Background:</B>
   <UL>Churchill as it is called in human space, was born on a 
Virus ravaged planet in Spica sector.  It's nest focused on 
construction, but Churchill wanted to see the stars, it joined 
the Federation navy, and served 8 years aboard the Cruiser 
Yechbin.  The Yechbin patrolled the edges of Federation space, 
fighting off several Vampire incursions.  It was during this time, 
that Churchill came to hate, if any Hiver can feel that emotion, 
virus.  It had done more damage to the Federation than any other 
species ever had.  It also came to realize what a threat humans 
were. They had created Virus, and had accidently released it. If 
they were left to their own devices, they would surely destroy 
the entire galaxy.  It found out a group of Hivers who felt the 
same way, they formed a Shadow Nest inside of the Federation 
Navy.  This nest felt that humans had potential, but they must 
be cured of their dangerous tendecies. With a bit of guidence the 
humans could be made a useful part of the Federation.<P>

It left the Navy, and used several contacts to land a position as 
a Federation Diplomat.  Churchill was quite good at this, and was 
instrumental in adding a new member species to the Federation. It 
was for this task, it was awarded Manipulator status. It is quite 
proud of its accomplishment, and will tell others about it in 
great detail, but it tends not to talk about it to humans, as it 
knows that humans find the whole talk of manipulation to be 
discomforting.<P>

Churchill has moved to Coalition Space both to learn more about
humans, and also to help promote the goal of the Shadow Nest. It 
has made contact with 
<A HREF="dani0002.html">Assemblyman MacBaen</A> from Aurora.  
<A HREF="dani0002.html">Assemblyman MacBaen</A> has recently 
gathered a crew and a ship, to peform missions out into the Wilds.  
Churchill has succesfully manipulated 
<A HREF="dani0002.html">MacBaen</A> into asking Churchill to be an 
advisor to the ship.  It will help guide the ship and its crew, 
to further the goals of the Shadow Nest.<P>

<A HREF="dani0002.html">MacBaen</A> considers Churchill to be a 
friend, and as far as any Hiver can be a friend, it is.  
Churchill finds much to admire in 
<A HREF="dani0002.html">MacBaen</A>. Churchill feels that 
<A HREF="dani0002.html">MacBaen</A> shows many of the traits that
will make the humans a valuable addition to the Federation, as 
soon as some of their more aggressive traits are winnowed.</UL>

discerning eye, it is slightly bigger than the average adult 
Hiver. It also has several grey spots on its third right rear 
leg.</UL>
