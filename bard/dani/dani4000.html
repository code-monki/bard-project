<A NAME="HISTORY"><H3>HISTORY</H3></A>

The Templars are a fighting order dedicated to the elimination of 
Virus.  They were formed in 1196 by Armand Sourez, an eldery 
Aubaine billionaire.  Armand was a teen when Virus swept away 
civilization.  He saw his home destroyed and his parents killed. 
The effects were unbearable to the yout Armand and it crippled 
him emotionally.  He became very detached and focused all his 
energy on expanding his sizable inheritance. The Collapse 
devestated the economy of Aubaine, but he was able to take 
advantage of other's misfortune.  His fortune grew in spite of 
the Collapse.  He never had the time, or desire for a family.  
Armand welcomed the creation of the Dawn League, and went on to 
helpe fund the <I>DLS Brilliant</I> and the <I>DLS Dawn</I> on 
their recontact missions. When the Twelve went missing, he 
started to suspect that Virus was still a danger.  Sending out 
operatives to see if Virus was still around, he was not surprised
when the operatives came back and confirmed that Virus was 
still a threat. Armand was incensed by this, and decided to take 
action.  With several military officers, who felt as Armand did, 
he founded the Templars. He has endowed the Templars with his 
entire fortune, which, as Armand is considered one of the five 
wealthiest men on Aubaine, is quite considerable.<P>

The Templars soon began to recruit members.  They offered 
lifelong employment, as long as the recruit was willing and able 
to fight any and all signs of Virus.  The Templars do not care 
about past crimes or mistakes, all that is required is the desire 
to fight Virus. The Templars are paid a small monthly salary of 
100 Aubani Credits plus room and board. The Templars live under 
strict military discipline, and recruits are trained in many 
differnt skills to use in the fight against Virus. In the early 
days of the organization, the recruits were trained in a broad 
number of skills, but as the organization grew, its members began 
to specialize more and more.<P>

The organization plans on taking care of its members for life.  
Eldery Templars will be used as trainers, advisors and desk 
workers.  Templars that are to feeble to work, or that have been 
cripped in battle will be given a comfortable retirement in the 
Coalition at a rest home owned by the organization.  The Templars 
plan on setting up special rest homes, as needed, but they don't 
plan on have any members needing to retire for decades.<P>

In 1202 the Templars have about 2500 members.  The Templars have 
a secret training facility on Wrangell 
(1839/Old Expanses X666302-1).  Anyone researching it would know 
that the Templars have a base somewhere trailing of the Coalition, 
but The Templars keep the base's location a secret in case Virus 
has human allies who might betray them.  This base is rather 
small currently.  It is equipped with barracks and facilities 
for several thousand troops and a small landing pad for 
starships. The Templars are equiped mostly with TL-10 equipment 
with scattered TL-11 equipment. While the current TL on Aubaine 
is 12, the RC military has bought up most of the TL-12 and Tl-11 
equipment and there is little left for private groups.  As it 
becomes available the group plans to upgrade its equipment.  
The Templars have several dozen Tl-10 tracked tanks and AFVs; 
however, the Templars lack a means of transporting the equipment 
from orbit the field. The Templars are trying to aquire a troop 
transport. They have also looked into buying a 
<A HREF="/sara/sara####.htm">Dawn Clipper</A>, and a
<A HREF="/sara/sara####.htm">Warlock SDB</A>.<P>

The group currently has three starships, two Patrol Cruisers and 
a Fer-de-Lance Destroyer Escort.  However, the Templars are 
activily seeking new warships.  Almost all recovered military 
technology offered at Auction is taken by the military, but the 
Templars try to get around this, by purchasing items outside the 
RC, primarily on Lancer.  Since the item isn't offered at Auction, 
the seller does not have to pay a host cut, and on a 
multi-million credit sale this can add up to a significant profit. 
Recovered technology that hasn't gone through the Auction 
process can not be brought into the RC, but the Templars don't 
want to bring its ships inside of the RC, they want to fight 
Virus, and Virus is out in the Wilds. The only problem the 
Templars have is that eventually their ships will need repairs 
that they are unable to preform themselves. The Templars are 
approaching this problem on two fronts.  First, they are trying 
to improve their own ability to repair vessels at their own 
starport, and second, they are trying to get the Assembly of 
Worlds to pass legislation allowing them to bring their ships 
into Coalition ports for the needed repairs.<P>

<A NAME="STRUCTURE"><H3>STRUCTURE OF THE ORGANIZATION</H3></A> 

The Templars are lead by a Commandant, currently Field Marshall 
Kelkon, formally of the Oriflamme Special Forces.  The Commandant 
is advised by a circle of twelve officers.  The Templars divide 
their forces into two groups. The Star Troops crew the ships, and 
act as ground troops. About 90% of the Templars are Star Troops. 
The Star Troops also provide the logistics and supply support for 
themselves Templars.  The remaining 10% are the Scouts.  The 
Scouts are constantly on the lookout for signs of Virus 
infestations.  They work mostly undercover, as Free Traders, 
Lancers, or even in the RCES.  When they discover signs of Virus, 
they send a coded message to one of many message drops the 
Templars have established.  The Commandant and his aides then 
decide if the infestation is one that the Templars can handle, or 
if they must keep an eye on it until their forces are sufficient 
to deal with the location.<P>

Armand Sourez still takes an active role in the organization. He 
has wisely turned over the military planning to seasoned warriors 
such as Commandant Kelkon, but he is still engaged in long range 
planing. He also busies himself in increasing support for the 
Templars within the Coalition. He has hired an Aubaine PR firm, 
to increase awareness and acceptance of the Templar's goals.  
This is also tied into a large scale recruitment drive.<P>

The Templars have taken over the planet Wrangell. They have 
convinced several hundred of the locals to grow food for the 
Templars. In exchange, the Templars promise protection against 
the rampagings of Virus, offer agricultural improvements, and 
trade high tech devices like weapons.  The Templars have also 
started a school for the children of the locals.  This is not a 
very elaborate affair, but the Templars hope that they can 
educate the populace so that it can serve as a source of educated 
recruits.  Many of the locals are work for the Templars, as cooks 
and janitors.  This frees up more Templars to serve in an active 
combat roles.<P> 

Officially the RC has no position on the Templars, they are 
considered just another mercenary organization. Unofficially, they 
have many sympathizers both in the government, the RCN and the 
RCES.  These sympathizers often clue the Templars onto leads of
 new Virus infestations, and the Templars often share with these 
allies about Virus infestations that are too large for the 
Templars to handle.<P>

<A NAME="STRATEGY"><H3>STRATEGY AND PLANS FOR THE FUTURE</H3></A>

By 1202 the Templars have only achieved modest success, they 
have destroyed three Vampire ships: two Far Traders, and a 
heavily damaged Merc Cruiser.  They have managed to destroy 
several infected systems on unihabited worlds of the So Skire 
main.  This has given the Templar technicans some practice in 
combating Virus.  The leadership has planned for the first few 
years to be a building time where they can train themselves in 
fighting Virus.  By mid-1202 they plan to launching an attack 
against several targets that their Scouts have identified.<P>

The Templars are almost fanatical when it comes to fighting 
Virus.  Anyone who helps or assists Vampires or Virus, according 
to the Templars, is a traitor to humanity, and deserves death.  
The Templars will use overwhelming and massive force to destroy 
Virus infected systems if necessary.  Human casualites are 
regretable, but often neccesary.  The Templars have a large 
supply of X-ray laser detonation missles and are not opposed to 
using them against ground based targets if necessary.  They have 
recently aquired a small number of pre-war Imperial nuclear 
weapons in the 30-40 megaton range.  These will have been stored 
away for use as a last resort.<P>
