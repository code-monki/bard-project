Shenandoah is a fairly low population world and does not have extensive military units.  There are approximatly 3000 members of the defense forces, with almost 2000 of those being reservists.  This combined force is called the Citizen's Militia.  In the event of a hostile attack, the main body of the defense forces would oppose the attack and reservists would fall back and form a guerilla movement.  The 1000 soldier standing army is organized in one battalion composed of three infantry companies and one tank company.  Most support duties are subcontracted out to civilian organizations.
<P>
One component of the reservists are snipers who would harass and demoralize the enemy.  Since the formation of the Reformation Coalition, the Shenandoah government has converted a company of snipers to active duty to support RC military activities.  Half of the company has been assigned to Aubaine for RC missions.  The other half remains on Shenandoah, where they train new recruits. The company bears no special name, and is simply called the Fifth Company.
<P>
The government has also funded the creation of a sniper school.  The RCES or an RC world can send military personal for a year long training school.  In game terms, this is represented by special duty, where the special duty skill represents a skill useful for snipers such as explore, gun combat, disguise etc.  Potential snipers also need slug rifle 4+.
<P>
The RC has used the snipers sparingly.  Most of their work is classified and not known to the general population or even most RC military personnel.  They have been used to assasinate TEDs on Nova Ryll and Lote.  Most TEDs have high security, so those missions are fairly rare, more often the snipers are used in low level conflicts, where the snipers can target officers and political leaders.  It is hoped by attacking the leadership, the bloodshed can be minimized.
<P>
The Shenandoah snipers take a great deal of pride in their work and it take a special person to spend weeks apart from their unit in hostile territory.  Unlike many military actions, sniping is not an impersonal act.  Every sniper sees the face of the target before it gets hit.  Snipers are often tortured and killed by opposing forces as they inspire fear and terror.  While the Fifth company takes pride in their abilities, they are not a showy unit.  They don't have a colorful nickname and they hardly ever engage in bragging or brawling with other units.  They regard these activities as frivolous and childish.
<P>
The Shenandoah snipers use the TL-6 13mm sniper rifle (RC Equipment Guide pg 55); the optical sight has been replaced with electronic sights imported from Oriflamme. Most snipers carry a handgun in case they are suprised.
<P>
Snipers have a prequisite of agility or strength 6+.  Sniper's use the standard Army career, though Artillary cluster is replaced with disguise skill and heavy weapons is replaced with the acrobat cluster. Snipers are trained in camoflauge and often wait hours for a target to appear.  All gun combat skills are taken as slug rifle.  Shenandoah snipers work in groups of three.  Snipers are adept at working in the wilderness and living off the land.  In addition to sniper skills, the snipers are also trained as counter-snipers.  The importance of this training has increased since RCES operatives have encountered crunch guns in the Wilds.  Counter-sniper skills include observation and tracking.
