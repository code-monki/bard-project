<UL><B>History:</B>
<UL>  Cmmdr Syoisuis is the Commander of the Squardon enforcing the
Red Zone around 	<A HREF="../opal/opoal9502.html">Gerome</A>/Rhylanor. Syoisuis is a Regency Aslan,
his family has been in the Marches for about 120 years, they
were the survivors of a small clan that lost a particularly
vicious clan war.  As he is a Regency Aslan, he acts fairly human.
He recognizes that different sexes can preform the same job,
that humans have a sense of honor, though it is different than
that of Aslans.  Several True Aslan have challenged Syoisuis to
duels.  Syoisouis has won all of these, this has given  him  some
measure of respect from True Aslan.<BR><BR>

  Cmmdr Syoisuis has had an illustrious career, at first being
assigned to patrolling the Coreward border of the Aramis Subsector.
As a Lieutenant he was instrumental in stopping a Vargr
Corsair raid on Nasemin. For this he received the first of his
many commedations. After several years he was transfered to the
23rd fleet. In 1191 he was given command of the 49th Squadron.
He hopes to make Admiral before he retires, which will probably
be in 10 years or so.<BR><BR>

   Syoisuis is extremly loyal to the Regency,  and the Regency
Navy.  He will do what ever it takes to keep them safe.  He has
no problem covering up the mistakes that lead to the Red Zone on
Gerome.  He will deal with any intruders to the Gerome system
extremly harshly. The ships in the taskforce have orders
to fire on any ships which refuses to halt.  Ships which do yield
will be boarded, and all personal interrogated. They will be tried
in a military court, most probably sentenced to Exile/Deneb.
