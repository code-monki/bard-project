<UL><B>Background:</B>
   <UL>
   Born sometime in 1067, (her people did not record
   births, but she chose Holiday as her "official" birthday<sup>1</SUP>), in
   a community of TL 1 Vargr on Pscias (2106/Spinward Marches).
   While still a pup, D'Yan<sup>2</SUP> stowed away on  a  Scout  ship that was
   surveying the world, and by the time she was discovered, the ship
   was already in Jump. By then it was too late to return her - she had
   already seen too much to be safely returned to a world that knew
   nothing of aliens or other worlds - and so the crew decided to adopt
   her. The Scout Service were understandably unhappy about this, but
   reluctantly agreed that there was no practical alternative.  As
   soon as she was old enough, D'Yan enlisted in the IISS, and soon
   became an expert - if slightly eccentric - Scout, preferring
   long-range exploration and survey missions, (ideally alone).  One
   of the first things she did after joining was to track do the
   nearest Psionics Institution and get herself tested. She was happy
   to  discover that she qualified for a scholarship, and went
   back for training as soon as she had enough leave saved  up.  Her
   Psionic powers are probably the main reason that D'Yan has survived
   so long - she has a habit of regularly getting herself into
   life-threatening situations, and being able to Teleport to safety
   can be extremely useful!  Her  career came  to a sudden end in 1110,
   when her superiors discovered that D' Yan practised an unusual
   custom: she enjoyed  eating  sentient creatures.  This was
   discovered  when, after an unsuccessful First-Contact mission, her
   superiors found that she had eaten the  alien ambassador. Apparently
   nobody had known that cannibalism was an acceptable practice on her
   homeworld, and so had never bothered to tell her not to do it.
      <P>   In order to avoid  a  scandal,  the  IISS  simply  declared
   her "psychologically  unsuitable for service", and quietly discharged
   her. After the Scout Service, D'Yan turned to a life of crime
   and hedonistic  self indulgence, often running foul of the law
   with crimes including riot, grand larceny, murder, and attempted
   genocide<sup>3</SUP>,  but usually managed to escape, (by a combination of
   Psionics, excessive violence, and blind luck). By 1113, however,
   she had managed to anger just about every law enforcement agency
   and organised crime syndicate in the entire Domain of Deneb, so she
   stole herself  another  Scout/Courier<sup>4</SUP> and  headed
   Rimward/Trailing, reaching the Solomani Rim shortly
   before war broke out<sup>5</SUP>. After this, her activities are unknown
   for several years, although it is believed she headed Corewards,
   just ahead of the Solomani  advance.  She  went  into  cold-sleep
   shortly after Virus struck, and was defrosted in 1197.  D'Yan has
   never been  married,  and  has  no children, although she does claim
   to have been cloned several times. However, she cannot remember how
   many times, or where it was done, and has no knowledge of the
current location of any of the clones.

<UL><B>Appearance:</B>
   <UL> D'Yan is about average height for a Vargr, (1.5m),
with black hair, (now almost totally grey). She is quite attractive,
if you're fond of hair, teeth, and claws, and usually seems
to  be smiling at some private joke. The attractive appearance,
however, is rather offset by her pathological hatred  of  bathing,
giving  her a...err...unique aroma. D'Yan dresses rather
conservatively for a Vargr, preferring her old Scout Service tailored
vac suit with all insignia removed. If she expects to get into
combat, D'Yan wears a set of TL14 Combat Armour, (which she  has
sprayed  pink in the hopes that the enemy will think she's a human).
She uses the same helmet with both suits -  this  has  been
modified with a holographic projector to give the impression  that
there  are goldfish swimming around inside<sup>7</SUP>.
</UL>
</UL>
<UL><B>Personality:</B>
   <UL> It is generally agreed that there is no such thing
as a "typical Vargr"; D'Yan is the exception to this rule. Everything
that has ever been said about Vargr is probably true of
D'yan:  she likes loud music, and even louder colour-schemes; she
likes things that go fast, and things that go boom; she makes up
the rules as she goes along, and believes that laws are things
that only apply to other people. D'Yan's motto is: "if it feel  s
good, do it...and keep  doing it until you pass out and slide
under the table." As an example of how she puts this  into
practice,  whenever D'Yan arrives on a new planet, she throws a Party
capital 'P'. The Parties are never advertised, they just happen
spontaneously, usually beginning in a bar in a particularly seedy
area of Startown, and ending...well , almost anywhere. D'Yan doesn't
consider a Party to be a success unless a) it lasts more than 12
hours, b)  the  number of people involved is more than 500, c) the
local authorities have to call in the Marines to end it, d) it costs
more than MCr1, and e) she can actually remember less than half
of it.  Despite her age, and the abuse she regularly subjects her
body to, she is still in good physical condition and is hyperactive
to the point that most people get exhausted just watching
her.  D'Yan has one interesting idiosyncrasy: she gets very guilty
about hurting people. In at least one case, after blowing
someone's arm off she sent the unconscious body by taxi to the
nearest hospital, along with enough money to pay for a cybernetic
replacement.  Not  surprisingly, D'Yan's favourite food is raw
meat, (ideally still alive). She will usually be satisfied with
an extremely rare steak, but she does have a rather unnerving
habit of cutting out "ginger-bread men" from it, Telekinetically
animating them, and then enthusiastically chasing them around
the room<sup>8</SUP>.</UL>
</UL>
<UL><B>Motivation:</B>
   <UL><I>Joker:</I> D'Yan is, of  course, certifiably  insane. </UL>
   <UL><I>Heart 4:</I> She likes people, and is generally fairly
                    amiable and talkative.</UL>
</UL>

<UL><B>Possessions:</B><UL> Extremely variable. D'Yan makes most of her money by
either gambling or bank robbing, depending on how she feels and
how well-armed the local police are. However, she doesn't collect
money or material possessions just for the sake of it, but
merely as an aid to Having Fun.  She will usually have
(Cr10 - MCr6 ) available, usually carried loose in a
large black holdall.  There are certain items that D'Yan will
always  have:  A bowl of goldfish.  An IISS-issue TL15 tailored
vac suit, slightly battered but still airtight.  An suit of
Imperial Marine-issue TL14 Combat Armour, painted pink, extremely
battered and no longer airtight.  A TL12 Gauss Pistol, with
several clips of assorted ammunition. An experimental TL16 Fuion
Pistol, with one or two clips.  A rather tatty-looking
pink sheet of paper, (normally in a waterproof bag) -
this is her psychological discharge from the Scout Service,  and
is her most valued possession.  A blade weapon of some sort.</UL>

<UL><B>Notes:</B>
<LI>[1] When she celebrates, everyone celebrates!
<LI>[2] D'Yan is how she is normally known; her complete name is
extremely long and known only to herself, and she regularly adds new
syllables to it, (it tells the story of her life in her native tongue,
of course, nobody outside Pscias speaks it, so she generally only
uses it to annoy bureaucrats and officials who ask for her full name).
<LI>[3] She encountered a minor race that tasted so disgusting she
decided to wipe them out.
<LI>[4]  D'Yan has a terrible  memory, and can never
remember where she  parked her ship. Her solution is to steal a
new one - preferably a Scout/Courier, since she usually travels
alone.  However, just in case she ever remembers where she parked
one, she always sets up a bank  account at every starport she
visits with a large enough balance to cover the docking fees for
several years.
<LI>[5] She would like to believe there was a connection
between these two events.
<LI>[6] D'Yan claims to be able to identify a species by taste.
<LI>[7] She  first  tried using real goldfish inside a water-filled inner
layer inside the helmet, but they kept dying. Plus, she was
always afraid that the glass might break and get her wet.
<LI>[8] She rarely does this in private - she prefers to save it for
expensive restaurants, or when she is with people she wants to
embarrass.
