<UL><B>Background:</B> Rafton grew up on the Jabberwock colony in Alpha Crucis. GenAssist formed a unit to serve with the Airborne Rangers of Thassor in Oriah/Alpha Crucis.  He was 25 when the Imperium broke apart in civil war. Thassor was slow to respond to the Confederation's call for troops and his unit missed the initial invasion of the Old Expanses.  In 1118 Thassor sent three divisions of Rangers and the battalion of Jabberwocks to assist in the invasion.  His unit saw action in Thoezzent subsector. The unit was involved in several planetary invasions. The Solomani Army tried to use the unit as a peacekeeping unit, but the Jabberwocks did not have the intelligence to deal with the complicated situations found in peacekeeping. His unit spent the entire war fighting in either the Old Expanses or in Diaspora sector.  Casualties were replaced by recruits sent from the colony in Alpha Cruics.  In 1130 his unit was sent on a covert mission deep into Diaspora sector.  As usual the Jabberwocks were shipped in low berth.  Somewhere along the way the ship was infected by the Virus and never finished its journey.  The ship simply stopped responding to outside commands as the ship's computer sat and contemplated its electronic navel.  The computer continued to power all the available systems, but would not move from the system it was in.  The crews attempts to reassert control were met with lethal force, but otherwise the ship let the crew alone. Eventually they ran out of food and starved.  In the New Era the jump engines are unusable due to lack of maintenance, but the rest of the ship limps along as it drifts through the system it is in.  Its exact reaction to other human ships is uncertain, it could ignore them or it could flee.  It might not even care if it was boarded along as the invaders did not interfere with its internal system.  It has several maintenance robots that can be used to persuade visitors to leave vital systems alone.  Also it can still play grav ping pong.  
<P>
Rafton and the other Jabberwocks are still in low berth.  Originally there were 18 Jabberwocks, with Rafton being the highest ranking Jabberwock in the unit.  They are all heavily trained and experienced soldiers.  It is unknown how many have survived through the long sleep and can be revived.

<UL><B>Goals:</B>
   <UL> Crpl Clark has very simple goals. He wants to be warm and fed and to be allowed to occasionally have a fight.  He very much likes war.  In general he is exactly what his creators made him: a killing machine who loves his job.  Once he is revived he will try to find a human government that he and his surviving troops can serve.  He is used to human officers telling what to do; he is just not used to deciding his own fate.</UL>
</UL>

<UL><B>Motivation:</B>
 
   <UL><I>Ace of Clubs:</I>-War Leader  Crpl Clark commands great respect from those around him, who have seen him in action. This is both from his fellow Jabberwocks and also from many of the human officers who he has served with.  He is not very smart and will never be able to command large number of troops or design elaborate battle plans. But when it comes to a small tactical engagement he is able to come up with an excellent battle plan.  He also treats those under his command extremely well and they love him and will follow him anywhere.</UL>
   <P>
   <UL><I>Seven of Hearts</I> Crpl Clark is extremely loyal to his fellows soldiers.  This includes all Confederation soldiers both Jabberwock and Human.  He is willing to take great risks to save a fellow soldier. He has been rewarded with several medals for gallantry above and beyond the call of duty.</UL>

<UL><B>Possessions:</B> The hold of the ship held battle dress and weapons for the entire unit.  The crew of the ship used some of this equipment against the ship and its robots.  The only thing Rafton has on his person is his uniform.</UL>
