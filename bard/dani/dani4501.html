<UL><B>Background:</B>
   <UL>

   The most promising of his father's many sons, Hughie was helping to set up astrogating matrixes
   from the age of 6, and was selected by his clan as part of the permenant crew of the <I>Al Dabaran</I> from
   15.
   <P>
   The vast majority of his travels is plying a safe interface route between Dophkah and Errogel/Million/Deneb, the unoffical subsector capital of Million
   sector today [hey, it does have a working Vargr corsair, which is one more ship than any other
   system in the Million wilds can claim!] Exactly two other merchantmen - both owned by the Vargr -
   operate in the subsector, and both ship's are in worse shape than his (not that the casual observer
   could tell the difference).
   <P>
   Only very occassionaly would the<I>Al Dabaran</I> leave it's single safe route, usually to pick up one of
   the clan's trained technican's from advisiory duties on one blasted world or another. About five of
   these valuable brothers is on Segan/Million/Deneb, helping the local TED maintain his machines, and richly
   rewarded for doing so.

   <P>
   Is a major `family elder' of his 32-member clan, with the menfolk usually scattered throughout the
   Deneb Wilds: most of the women and children is located on Dophkah's Starport. (Yes, local Free
Trader culture is quite patriarchal)

<UL><B>Appearance:</B>
   <UL>Once a strong, handsome daredevil, a Rebellion-era mine robbed him of a chunk of his face and much
of his strength. With chin and front teeth missing, Hugie is quite repulsive: he continues to trade, but
makes sure that strangers who wish to see him are warned by his shipmates about his appearance,
to reduce the shock.
<P>
The incident also created difficulties in speech.  </UL>
