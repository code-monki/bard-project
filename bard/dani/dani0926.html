<UL><B>Occupation:</B> Unemployed Starship Pilot </ul>
     
<UL><B>Attributes:</B> <TT>687789-7</TT></UL>
<UL><B>Background:</B>
   <UL>The Estralla family (probably not the original family name) was lucky.  They 
managed to keep their Jayhawk freighter, <I>Sylvan Dancer</I>, when most other 
ships were infected with Virus or destroyed by it.  Since the collapse they 
have been trading with anyone with goods.  The crew are the descendants of 
the original crew.<P>
Wallace never knew any other home.  It was always one planet to the next, 
sometimes an inhabited planet sometimes not.  At times it could be boring, 
but it gave him a chance that few kids had: to see the galaxy.
As the son of the captain's line, Wallace became an officer almost 
instantly.  He had no formal education, receiving his training as an 
apprentice would; on the job.  Mathematics came naturally to him so he found 
astrogation especially appealing.<P>
Just before Wallace turned twenty, the <I>Sylvan Dancer</I> went on a long mission 
into the wilds after a reported cache of relic technology.  The trip was a 
disaster.  The planet did  have relics, which were controlled by a paranoid 
TED.  The crew only found this out, however, after they landed.  Three 
members of the crew where killed in the escape from the planet and the sort 
space battle with the planet's decrepit systems defence boat.  Fuel was 
short,but Wallace charted a coarse that took them directly to the next 
systems gas giant.  Wallace's parents, who had been captain and first 
officer had been killed, since they usually led the trading efforts.  His 
older sister, Vallan, the oldest in the captain's line, took over.  As 
second oldest Wallace became first officer.<P>
The <I>Sylvan Dancer</I> made the long trip back to the area of the Reform 
Coalition, where it did much of its trading.  For the couple years things 
were fairly quiet. It occurred to Wallace that the <I>Sylvan Dancer</I> was 
becoming a little crowded.  His younger brother Xander had taken a wife, and 
the engineer had just had another child.  Keeping the population of the ship 
low enough had always been a problem, since there were often more kids then 
parents.  Wallace began to consider other options.<P>
The final factor in his decision was Vallan's announcement that her 
boyfriend, a dirtside trader, had proposed to her.  Wallace knew Val would 
not leave her ship, which meant her husband would come to live on the Sylvan 
Dancer.  By tradition, when the captain's spouse gained enough experience 
(s)he became first officer.  Knowing he would lose his spot as first officer 
and realizing the ship was getting overcrowded anyway, Wallace decided to 
start making inquiries about jobs on other ship.  With experience as a pilot 
and an astrographer in addition to a trader, and a talent for dealing with 
people, Wallace felt confident he would be able to find employment.<P>

<UL><B>Motivation:</B>
 
     <UL><I>Heart Ace:</I>  Wallace has not had too much time to build a reputation, but what 
   reputation he has is as an honest man who will offer a fair deal.  Having 
   been to many planets and encountering many cultures, he has few prejudices, 
   one being cheats and liars.  That has made finding a job more difficult, 
   since he refuses to deal with the Mercantile Guild and some free traders.</UL><P>
    <UL><I>Heart 2:</I>  Wallace has an easy, open manner that has served him well in his 
   excursions as a trader.  He is pleasant, but also has a strong desire for 
   privacy, something he did not have enough of as a child.  He rarely talks 
   about himself or his past beyond his qualifications, making him difficult to 
know well.<P></UL>
