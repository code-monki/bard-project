	The Church Manichean is the main religion practiced by the Balduri.  It
is an ancient faith with roots in the Deist Revival movements of the
Ilelish Sector during the Long Night.  It was brought to Baldur by the
first settlers, colonists of Darmine origin from L'steich.
<p>
	The Manichean scripture is called the Book of the Astavedas, and is
written in Darmine (the text is extensively annotated in Anglic,
however).  The Astavedas were holy teachers of the Mimyana sect of Deism
during the Long Night.  Their essays on the nature of God and the
practice of virtue were collected into the book that bares their name
(the book itself is considered the last Astaveda, as it is a compilation
of the pith and wisdom of the collected whole).  A secondary set of
scriptures, the Lesser Commentaries, consists of expoundations on the
Book, as well as bios of the Astavedas themselves.
<p>
	The theology of the Church Manichean posits the existance of a single
God who is all-loving, and all-knowing but not all-powerful.  Having
given free will to living creatures, it cannot prevent suffering and
evils resulting from that gift.  Sapient minds must rise above petty
hatreds to ensure the triumph of love and the completion of God's
creation.  Because of the perils of the Universe, the virtuous soul must
cultivate determination and fierce will to oppose evil every waking
moment.  As a reflection of God's purpose, the sapient mind strives to
impose order and harmony.  Evil men and the randomness of creation may
upset one's work, but the individual earns God's grace by participation
in the effort which will one day bring about the Creator's will.
<p>
	The Church is organized into three levels beyond the laity; Keepers,
Rectors, and Deacons.  The Deacons are the regular clergy, and have
educational as well as spiritual duties.  The Rectors are mainly
concerned with administration, and run the individual church properties,
as well as overseeing the districts.  The Keepers function is mainly
ritualistic and educational; having passed through the Rectorate, they
are expected to be above political and social matters.  Only Keepers may
read from the Book of the Astavedas in front of the congregation.
<p>
	The different levels vary by dress as well.  The typical garb of the
Manichean clergy is a simple brown robe with a high collar.  Deacons
carry a small wand and wear a rough belt of rope.  Rectors carry a
wooded staff and wear a set of heavy iron links around their necks. 
keepers bear and iron keey and a collapsable fan.  The most senior
Keeper carries a large two-handed sword known as the Sword of Truth.
<p>
	Most Balduri are reverent of the Church, and are unwilling to tolerate
any sort of disrespect to it.  Cuffs and whacks are not uncommon to
those who would poke fun at it.  Some would say that the Balduri are
overly sensitive in this matter.<p>
