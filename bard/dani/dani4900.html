<UL><B>Occupation:</B> Scout/Diplomat </UL>

<UL><B>Attributes:</B> <TT>9466A8-A</TT></UL>
<UL><B>Background:</B>
   <UL>After graduating from a local "university", Kyuiwei  was
selected  to  join  her  clan's  scientific  community as a field
scout/scientist.  As scientisis were the subgroup most likely  to
interact with the Strangers (ie. Aslans outside of the Yekhakteal
clan) she became exposed to these folk, and - unlike her peers  -
wrote  about  these strange Aslans with their peculiar habits for
the general public.
<P>
Worldwide fame and notoriety was produced: the government
initally  attempted to discourage further writings, but, under pressure
from acadamia, business, and her hordes of  fans,  relented,  and
gave  her funds to continue exploring.  And explore she did: with
an aged trader with a questionable jump drive she explored  first
her subsector, then the entire sector, taking odd jobs and
speculating on cargo to keep food in the belly and the engines hot.
<P>
When she returned "to stay", she had not only bought  a  treasure
trove  of  information, but had inadvertantly laid the groundwork
for other clan members to follow, both business  and  scientists.
This led to a surge in the ecomony (Yekhaktei is the highest tech
system in the subsector), which led to a vastly increased government
interest in her explorations.
<P>
Eventually, the clan leaders managed to persuade  her  to  launch
another one-ship expedition, but as a formally accreddited
ambassador of her clan.  She was given the <I>Ouhaei  Hteftaihwoarl</I>,  a
gorgeous  TL-E  Aslan  scout/diplomatic  yacht, with a real lab,
probes, RCV equipment and everything, wrapped in a million credts
worth  of luxurious fittings, double-large rooms, whirlpool, etc.
And she was given a 'loose'itenary, involving contacting all  the
major clans of the Hierate, the Zhodani, and the Regency.
<P>
Kyuiwei has spent the last eight  years  away  from  her  distant
home,  and  has  seen more wonders than anyone else in her clan's
history.  Now completing her tour in the Zhodani Consulate, she's
now  in  Chronor  subsector,  preparing  to  enter  the  Spinward
Marches.  With most of her experiences of humans from the
Consulate, she would be initally very truthful and trusting, expecting
the truth in return. However, her view of the Regency will be  as
an  inferior  civilization, full of liars and mentally ill people
(as her Zhodani friends suggest).  Indeed, one of her crew  is  a
Zho  'guide'  (actually a SORAG agent), sent specifically to protect her from the Regency barbarians.

<UL><B>Appearance:</B>
   <UL>On rather light build for an Aslan, with a very long,
well-groomed  coat  of  black hair.  Her round face and oval eyes
(oval even for Aslan) is set off with a short snout.  Aslans  (or
humans  fluent in Aslan) would find her accent strange and harsh:
her Anglic is clear, if rather stilted.  Her style  of  dress  is
definitely unknown by local Aslans (and human Aslan watchers).
 </UL>
</UL>
<UL><B>Family:</B>
   <UL> Unmarried, to preserve her independence </UL>
</UL>
<UL><B>Personality:</B>
   <UL> Beyond the usual Aslan formality and pride,  Kyuiwei
is  incredibly  curious  ("as  curious as a Hiver" is the Regency
stereotype: of course, Kyuiwei would immediately  ask  to  see  a
real  live  one). Everything she sees must be poked, tested,
sampled and analyzed.  Even more interesting for an Aslan,  she
applies  her  curiouisity to sentinents - regardless of their
barbaric (ie non-Aslan) culture. She just must find out  more  about
them.   Her  non-judgemental  attitude  - very rare on her world,
where no human has been seen since the Rebellion  started  -  has
marked her out as her clan's Ambassator Extraordinare.</UL>
</UL>

<UL><B>Possessions:</B>
<UL>
 Ten MCr in diamond's gold, and radioactives,  a line of credit
 from her clan/only useable  in  the Hierate, an extensive database
 on the current Spinward States/although much of that info is over 10
 years out of date, Translator chips for every language in  the  Spinward
 States, another specialized database regarding the diplomatic/political
 situation (only 4 years out of date), subscriptions to nearly every news
 service,  political, scientific and business journal in existance
