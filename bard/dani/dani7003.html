 <P>
Elvis Larson, founder of the Society for True Humanity,
a spiritual/self-improvement movement popular during the period
of the Nth Interstellar Wars. Depending on the local activists,
the movement was part religion, part philosophy, and part scam.
The scams died out, the philosophy was absorbed into later
movements, and the religious aspects fragmented and formed the
basis for numerous local religions throughout the Solomani
Sphere and regions of Solomani expansion (including the Imperium).
Many of the religious sects canonized Larson as "Saint Elvis".
Due to the fragmented nature of the religion, local practices
vary in the extreme, often quite contradictory to practices
on other worlds.
