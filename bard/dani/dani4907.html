<UL><B>Background:</B>
   <UL>
Born and raised in the Kairovan community on Mora, Miss. Daya is one of the very few who can claim
to be a pure-blooded Arab. From her youth she wanted to follow in the footsteps of her ultra famous
great-grandfather Ali Daya (1088 - 1150). Ali Daya's suite of four interconnected biosystems under
the themes of "Loyalty, Trial, Victory" ranks with the best of the Old Masters in Dasudashag, and
had the same effect on the Deneb artistic community as the 1118 tri-v film "Stand on Rhylanor" had
on the general populance, or the Connie Chung series "Why We Are Imperials", or Norris' Ascension
Speech when he was formally proclaimed Archduke.
<P>
Sherali Daya stayed away from the epic-scale work of her great-grandfather for years, focusing
instead on doing regular commission work. But as her reputation & skill grew so did her aspirations,
and in 1192 she accepted a commission from a Fleet Admiral to create a new biosphere for the Naval
Base at Ansirk, home of 7 million Naval personnel.
<P>
The biosphere - to reside strictly within the installation, as the world is airless - is to emphasise the
motif "Controlled Fury". This theme is sympolized by the Terran lions, Vilani anshuui, and Reginian
LiClok which stalk some of the corridors and parks of the station. The predators (actually as safe as
dogs) are simply at the top of the station's "biosystem", which extends down to the carefully bred
rats and tailored airborne viruses.
<P>
Probably the most charming change to the station has been the introduction of perenay's; a geneered
variation of the white dove, with rainbow-coloured wing feathers. The ones at the station have been
bred for low-G flight, and are 'wired' to preform complex aerobatic flight patterns and make a most
haunting call.
