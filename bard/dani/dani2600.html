 Built by Aybee Wan Owen after the death of Dr. Krenstein (Aybee's own
 creator), Ary
 was both Aybee's wife and Daughter.  She fulfilled the void left by
 Krenstein's death. But, as had happened with his "father", Aybee would
 be visited by tragic circumstances again...this time at the hands of
 Virus.  
 When Virus found Aybee Wan Owen, it thought it had found the perfect
 host.  Here was a robot that could move around with humans, it was
 highly intelligent, and virtually undetectable with the unaided eye to
 be anything to do with Virus.  It found, however, that Aybee was largely
 immune to it's effects.  His Hiver-influenced repairs had inadvertently
 provided him with a kind of inoculation against the invasive A-I.  But,
 while Virus couldn't affect Aybee's programming, it did leave some
 encoding indistinguishable to anyone but the original creator disguised
 in his data port.  Any computer that Aybee directly interfaced with
 would become infected.  Not even Aybee, himself, could have known this,
 and Dr. Krenstein was no longer around to provide such insight.
 <P>
 Aybee built Ary using the same basic blueprints that he had been built
 with, adding relevant pieces of Ancients and Hiver technologies which Dr
 Krenstein and himself had studied.  the results were a reduced overall
 weight and a more realistic overall appearance as a human.  This was
 something that Aybee was particularly proud of, owing mainly to the fact
 that even a slightly more than casual medical examination would not
 indicate Ary's true nature.  It would only be under a surgeon's scalpel
 that Ary would be found to be an Android.  In addition to this
 camouflage, the combination of Hiver and Ancient technology created
 radical differences in her neural processing architecture.  
 <P>
 It was at this point that Aybee made the mistake he would come to regret
 even though he had no way of knowing what was to happen.  Aybee decided
 to directly download parts of his synaptic programming to Ary's own
 network.  The Virus, which had been dormant for so long within his data
 port began to stir.  Initially, Ary's personality developed normally,
 much the way Aybee's had in the early years.  Virus, of course, took
 time to mature.  It wasn't long before Ary began having memory lapses
 and other minor quirks as Virus grew and changed to adapt to her unique
 system.  Indeed, for many years, Aybee and Ary maintained the facade
 that they were human and lived happily during that time. Ary's lapses
 and quirks, Aybee reasoned, were the product of her realizing her own
 sentience.  
 <P>
 Indeed, Ary was becoming sentient, but it was not quite as Aybee
 suspected.  Because they were living the "lie" of being human
 (especially in light of the fact that robots were more often destroyed
 rather than tested for Virus)  Ary began losing memories which dealt
 with her creation.  Rather than ask embarrassing questions about her
 past that she
 felt she should know, she simply accepted that she was and so,
 somewhere, at sometime, she had a mother and father and had been born,
 grew up and all the attendant things which go with that.  She began to
 believe in her own humanity. When an accident revealed Aybee as being a
 robot, it nearly destroyed Ary.  She had loved Aybee, but was now
 revolted by what he was.  Her love was strong, though, and she willed
 herself to stay with him and help him recover from the accident (most of
 the parts that were damaged had to be refabricated).  During this time
 she learned a lot about
 robot physiology.  But she was never quite sure if Virus would cause him
 to turn on her, as she had seen so many other automatons do toward other
 humans.  
 <P>
 Try as she might to reconcile her feelings toward Aybee, she could not. 
 Ary also had troubles of her own.  She had begun to reason out the
 puzzle of her own existence.  She had not aged.  She had no childhood
 memories.  She never got sick.  She couldn't explain how she knew
 anything other that she had just always known it.  It bothered her so
 much that she decided to ask Aybee if he could tell her anything.  
 <P>
 One day, months after the accident, Aybee was limping around their cabin
 (his leg motivator still required a few parts to be fully functional)
 and she decided that it was time.  Aybee was shocked to find out that
 she really didn't know what she was.  Realizing that she believed that
 she was actually human went a long way toward explaining why she had
 reacted as she had to the accident.  but he also realized that if he
 reviled the
 nature of her existence to her, she might just destroy herself to end
 such a revolting existence.  So Aybee hesitated.  That hesitation was
 all Ary needed to confirm, in her own mind, just what she was.  
 <P>
 If the survival instinct of the strain of Virus she had contracted had
 not been so strong, then Aybee's summation may have been carried to
 fruition.  As it was, the revelation left Ary confused.  She was angry
 at Aybee for his part in the deception.  Angry with him for creating
 her.  Angry at herself for being angry.  Angry at herself for not
 remembering. 
 Above all, she was angry for being one of the instruments of destruction
 for the Shattered Imperium.  Ary felt very disconnected with herself,
 her surroundings, and the one she loved.  After weeks of trying to come
 to terms with her situation, she said her good-byes to Aybee and left to
 find herself against the backdrop of the Wilds--that which had once
 been the penticale of civilized space.
 <P>
 Ary hoped that she could find her humanity in helping those which Virus
 had thrown down.  She felt guilty about all the death and destruction it
 had brought.  The mutations in her own infestation had caused much of
 this, but it became so ingrained that she began a one-robot crusade to
 help those wretches who had survived.  She studied virus every chance
 she got.  She found that she could not be reinfested with virus so long
 as she didn't hard dock to an infested system, so she removed her own
 data port.  She learned ways of preventing virus from infesting her
 small scout ship's computer and tried to reverse the process in other
 computers.  
 <P>
 She watched countless worlds succumb to the ministrations of Virus and
 grew to truly hate it.  Then, as she traveled further toward the Old
 Expanses,  she began to hear rumors of humans regaining the stars.  She
 was elated.  She knew that she had to find these humans, that she had to
 fit in with them, that she had to be a part of what they were doing. 
 There was a planet mentioned in these rumors as the base of operations
 for these "Star Vikings".  She had an old Imperial Data Base on the
 required sector and subsector, but had never had need to bring up the
 data.  Now she did and she set her course for Aubaine.
