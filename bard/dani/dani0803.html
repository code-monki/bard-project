<UL><B>Background:</B>
   <UL>Octavian was born on Trybec on 12/III/1164.  He spent his youth
tinkering and repairing computers and electronic devices.  At the same time
he discovered that he had a knack and a liking for scrounging and retrieving
necessary goods and components from the most unlikely places. From an early
age, Octavian realized that the job of recoverry and repair would be so much
easier if Trybec did not stand alone. Several worlds working together, he
reasoned, would do the job much faster and more efficiently than many weak
flames struggling against the night. To help facilitate his dream, he
attended the newly restored university and joined the fledgling Trybec
Diplomatic Corps. His earliest successes came in the form of trade
agreements with the various Free Traders operating in the area, and later
with other worlds attempting to reestablish regular trade routes. His
outstanding efforts earned him the praise and recognition of his superiors.
When the Hivers came, Octavian saw a chance to see his vision fully
realized. He applied and was accepted to the new Hiver Technical Academy on
Vras (Aubaine) and graduated as part of the famous Class of '93. He spent
his tour in the RCES making contacts and deals with the natives of several
Coalition worlds and neighbors, and participating in record numbers of
recoveries. He was a constant fixture at Auction, and even assisted in
running the operation in his crew's downtime. A hot recovery left him with a
leg injury severe enough that his time in the RCES was at an end, and when
he mustered out in 1200, he was appointed to take over the Auction as Chief
Auctioneer.

<UL><B>Appearance:</B>
   <UL>
Octavian is slightly below average in height, coming in at 1.7
meters, has a dark complexion, and wears his long, black, stringy hair in a
pony tail, a leftover from his youthful work with machines, and a
pencil-thin mustache. He always seems to have a smile and a certain relaxed
calm about him, an image cultivated from a lifetime of learning to read
people at the bargaining table. Despite his usual appearance in greasy
inspection coveralls, he tries to stay clean and well groomed. He still
walks with a slight limp from his injury as a crewmember aboard Angkor Wat.

<UL><B>Personality:</B>
   <UL>
Meeting Octavian, one gets the instant impression that he is a
man who seems to have few cares in the world. Constantly relaxed, and almost
carefree, he seems to be everybody's friend, and know most people in his
work enviornment or in the RCES HQ on a first name basis. His carefree
attitude is not overbearing or overwhelming, and is finely crafted to allow
others to feel at ease around him and a little more talkative. Overall, he
is a genuinely friendly person, and likes people. 
On top of this all, Octavian is a man of 100 questions and 1000 answers. In
any conversation, no matter how light the subject, he always prods for that
extra piece of information, and inevitably, he'll find what he's looking
for. At the same time, he's more than happy to volunteer information, the
value of which depends on his estimation of the person asking.

<UL><B>Motivation:</B>
   <UL><I>Heart King:</I>
 Honorable-Octavian is a man of his word, an unusual
quality for a man in his profession, but one that has actually worked in his
favor, as it has drawn more people to him, who know they can get a fair
deal, than deceit could ever have afforded him. 
 
   </UL>
   <UL><I>Diamond Ace:</I>
 Generous-At the same time, Octavian is very open about his
dealings, and very generous on terms, guaranteeing continued business, fair
trading, and a steady flow of goods for his precious Auction.

<UL><B>Refereeing  Octavian:</B>
   <UL>
 Octavian is the ultimate fountain of information for
characters seeking leads on recoveries, hot or cold. His life experiences
have afforded him a wealth of contacts on countless worlds, and throughout
the Free Trader Network. There isn't a business deal made at Auction, or a
rumor spread that Octavian doesn't know about. Sooner or later, it all
filters back to him. Unlike others with this kind of information network,
Octavian isn't big on selling information. He is a fan of capitalism, to be
sure, but just in seeing the system thrive, not necessarily in amassing a
fortune for himself. He still believes in the need for free unrestricted
trade, and the recovery of goods from boneyards and TED's, where they do
noone any good (in his eyes) for society to flourish. He is a sworn enemy of
the Guild, and it was in a runin with them as part of a landing party trying
to establish trade contacts that he was injured. Such an organization, he
feels, is a perversion of the system he loves so dearly, and anyone seeking
to hurt the Guild, will find Octavian a valuable ally. His specialty is
knowing about Guild operations and trade routes. He also can exist as an old
acquaintance from the Service, willing to help out a friend either still in
the service or working as a Lancer. He has the rundown on all the Freelance
crews that trade at Auction, and usually knows where they've been, what they
found or heard of, and where they are going next. He can even help set up
job interviews with some Lancer crews for people with the right experience
looking to get into the field. He occasionally hears rumors and gets a peak
at the occasional recon report in RCES hands that might lead to recovery of
items critical to the Coalition's survival. The tops at the RCES know good
and well, if they don't have the resources to recover some tech they need,
Rodriguez is their best chance at making sure someone else does for them,
and he's not above passing on their requests to the right people, or even
helping them locate good crews to hire directly. <p>

A character such as Rodriguez can easily become a caricature. It's important
that he be seen as someone with a bit more depth, released a little at a
time. The first image one gets upon meeting him is of a man who seems to
know everybody, and who everybody knows. Rodriguez is a shrewd judge of
character, though, and does not divulge information too quickly, or to
people he views as not having the best interests of the Coalition in mind.
Upon gaining his trust and respect, characters will find him a source of job
opportunities, or rumors that lead to potential work. After proving their
competence, they'll find him and even better source of information, and an
actual friend. He gets attached to people he knows very well, and looks out
for them when he can, even cutting the occasional better deal at Auction for
people he knows well. <p>

Rodriguez also knows several of the regulars and Auctioneers at other
planetary Auctions, and occasionally makes the circuit in search of certain
items he's trying to obtain for the Coalition, and to search out new
information. Barring these times, he's pretty much a fixture on Aubaine, and
likely will remain so for many years to come.<p>
