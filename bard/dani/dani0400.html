<UL><B>Background:</B>
   

	Possibly the oldest ruling Technarch on Oriflamme Red is old enough to
	remember the final war, as well as the collapse.  Born in 1110 to middle
	class parents in the Startown district, his first clear memories of his
	parents fear for their futures after news of Strephons assassination.  They
	lost their jobs in the banking sector as the war took hold and he spent most
	of his time on the streets with a gang, where he rapidly rose due to his
	natural intelligence and cunning.<P>
	
	After his parents were killed in a Black war raid, which destroyed much of
	startown he lived completely on the streets (rubble).   He soon became
	de-facto boss of the ruins, ruling a large gang of possibly 1000 persons who
	preyed on salvage crews and the local survivors.  He became such a major
	problem that the government decided to make him official and he became the
	mayor of startown, selling salvage rights to groups and recovering artefacts
	in his own right.  He was well on the road to respectability and riches when
	virus hit destroying the remaining infrastructure.  Red narrowly escaped
	with his life (and a few trusted lieutenants) to a hideaway in the mountains
	that he had secretly prepared.  Here he sat out the worst of the collapse
	occasionally sending one of his lieutenants on fact-finding missions.<P>
	
	Once the computer madness died down he came out of hiding and proceeded to
	take control of a farm town through sheer barbaric savagery.  Unfortunately
	having never worried where the food he bought came from, he hadn't�t
	reckoned with the drop in food production caused by the destruction of all
	the automated machinery. Starvation soon stalked the land and people
	attacked anywhere suspected of having food.  It did not take long for an
	well-armed mob to attack the town and force him out.  He spent the next few
	years drifting half starved from place to place, stealing and killing for
	food and seeing the devastation caused by Virus at first hand.<P>
	
	Red eventually washed up in another town and worked his way into the
	particularly vicious �militia� controlling the town.  His ruthlessness and
	intelligence gave him several promotions until in 1141 he became Commandant
	of the town (over several less ruthless bodies).  He ruled with an iron grip
	and soon began a campaign to conquer the surrounding areas, but as his
	domain grew he slowly began to improve his image as he realised that brute
	force would not keep him in power forever.  He began a system where people
	who accepted his rule willingly were allowed to progress and only extreme
	dissidents were killed.  In 1149 he introduced a form of feudal government
	to his area of control, but ensured that the serfs were never too harshly
	oppressed.   However he had only 1 golden rule, no computer controlled
	equipment was to be used at all and only idiot computers were to be used for
	record keeping etc..
	<P>
	As the world government started to evolve he became actively involved and
	willingly joined the council of Technarchs as a founding member.  He has
	been a strong opponent of raising the Tech level too quickly as he sees a
	dependence on technology as a serious weakness.  He is also violently
	anti-Virus (even more so than the norm).  Never having married there is no
	clear line of succession on his death and a bloody war is playing out now
	among his lieutenants for the position of heir, Red seems to find this war
	amusing and does nothing to stop it.<P>
	
	Red argued against the trading ships of the Dawn League as he was terrified
	that the Wilds would be Virus infested and ruined.  On being proved right he
	has argued vehemently against the expansion of the Coalition and is a strong
	opponent of any expansion of the AO, as he sees this as diluting the
	defensive strengths of the Coalition.  He will often a make the comment 'You
	don't know how bad it was, what you see out in the Wilds is diluted to 1% of
	what Virus was like when it started'.<P>
	
	He does not have off planetary troops and does not allow persons from his
	lands to serve offworld.  This has prevented his personal troops from
	becoming battle hardened but has also prevented the rebels from getting a
	power base within his realm.<P>
	
	Physically infirm now no one doubts the sharpness of his thinking and those
	that underestimate him soon learn that the ruthless intelligence is still
	there.  He is accompanied at all times by a fanatical bodyguard who have no
interest in the succession ands are heavily armed at all times.<P>
