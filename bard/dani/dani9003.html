<B>Headquarters:</B> Uramid/Antra and Rroerruerz/Antra
<P>
<B>Overview:</B> Founded in 1149. The Souk is the most professional and
widest ranging of the two free trader collectives. It also has the
biggest ships and the best crews. To feed such an enormous machine,
its crews range over a huge area of space, including frequent forays
into Tuglikki and Provence. This has led to both great wealth and
controversy for numerous members of the "company", especially in
light of rumored illegalities on the part of many of its members. The
Souk is not entirely free of its RQS stepmother, indeed many of its
operations mix legitimate trade with military and intelligence
operations of various kinds and scope.
<P>
<B>Organisational Data:</B> The Souk is organised like a modern corporation.
Indeed most of its founding personnel were Passing from the Regency,
or former RQS who brought a more formal bureaucratic structure to its
upper management. The top rungs of the company are overseen by an
actual board of directors that meet monthly on Uramid to overlook the
books, set short term goals and address recent problems. Many of
these are also ex<LI>RQS, an anomaly never really explained by local
subsector brass.  Many board members and upper managers have seemed
to profit greatly from their employment, even though the group's
charter limits the amount of compensation granted to them by normal
operations. Rumors of smuggling and unsupervised trade has dogged the
Souk for about thirty years now, though inspections by the RQS
inspector general has not uncovered any evidence of wrongdoing.
<P>
Individual ship captains are independent, but are considered
owner<LI>operator contractors under long term committment in return for
investment credits and other commercial benefits agreed upon in
employment contracts. Ship captains are obligated to follow fixed
schedules and fulfill their contracted quotas; how they accomplish
these goals is left to their individual discretion. Because of a
shortage of trained personnel in the Antra wilds, most of these are
former RQS and Navy crews who sign up for well paid, if not
lucrative, five year terms.
<P>
Otherwise the company is very formalised, possessing a crossconnected
network hiearchy of individual bases on the worlds it serves, each
manned by a group of factors, their security details, and support
personnel. Each base is a virtual starport in of itself, though many
lack the minimum safety equipment that would get them a minimum 'E'
rating. The main factors are found on Rroerruerz, as are the main
transhipment facilities. The company is currently leading the
negotiations for operating the new starport on Bangwe, as it hopes to
build a base closer to the reopened frontier.

<B>Trading Range:</B> The Souk has the largest territory of any free trader
collective so far encountered. It largely is centered in Lamas and
Antra, but also ranges over much of Millions, has bases at Aerverllol
(Tuglikki 2336), Othaksukh (Tuglikki 2436), Thaengzar (Tuglikki 2737)
Tuen (Tuglikki 2839) and Okhthalloe (Tuglikki 2937) to coreward, and
Lighoz (Provence 335) and Ofo<LI>Nebus (Corridor 0106) to trailing.
<P>
<B>Cargos:</B> The Souk is so called for its ability to piece together
freight loads from a wide range of goods and sources. Its ships carry
a very eclectic mix of goods and passengers collected over a dozen
different worlds at a time, all either travelling to or from the
Regency frontier rather than between different worlds. The smaller
traders operate for indefinite periods along secondary routes, acting
as feeders for the larger ships on the main Rroerruerz to Uramid
route. By some accounts these are sometimes involuntary affairs as
overzealous captains will use every means possible to "recruit"
passengers or cargos to meet their quotas. The Selene and Gazelle
class vessels are used for unofficial cargos, namely RQS and intel
personnel en route to deep listening posts or infiltration missions
of importance to the Regency of Deneb.
