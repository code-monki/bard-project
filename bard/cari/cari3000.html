According to canon, the Hierate was infected with Virus just like most of
Charted Space. Other than Doug Snyder's Aslan PE in the Ustral Quadrant, I haven't seen
anyone do much with them on the Web.  Digging in the Missouri Archive, one can find the proposed "Aslan in TNE"
sourcebook composed by Guy Garnett & a host of others. Included in that
treatise is a timeline by Hans Racke-Madsen roughly outlining events in the
Hierate
<P>
<B>1134</B>  First outbreaks of the Virus in the Aslan Hierate.
<P>
<B>1141</B>  Afteakhirl, a world in the Warostahe sector, successfully resists virus
infection, and maintains it's technological base relatively intact.  Due to
timely warning and rigorous protective measures, many important worlds in the
surrounding subsectors are similarly spared.
<P>
<B>1144</B>  The Fahrastyo is organized by the clan leaders of the surviving
spacefaring clans, and begin organizing relief and technology sharing
measures for their mutual benefit.  Twenty nine of the most prominent form a
new Tlaukhu, which meets regularly to ensure continuing inter-clan
cooperation.
<P>
<B>1157</B>  The Fahrastyo consolidates it's position and begins the first,
tentative exploration the virus-devastated regions on it's borders.
<P>
<B>1200</B>  Fahrastyo preliminary exploration teams enter Iwahfuah and Ealiyasiyw
sectors, operating from advanced outposts in Staihaia'yo.
<P>
<B>1201</B>  The The New Era begins in the Old Expanses.

The Aslan on the Regency side of the Rift (hereafter referred to as the Safe
Aslan) seem to be chomping at the bit to do "something."
They're hemmed in by the Rift & the Regency. Unfortunately, that's about all
GDW took care of before going under, unless I missed something. The Regency
Sourcebook says that they're alive and well but not much more than that.
<P>
We all know that their primary driving force is the acquistion of land. So
where do the Safe Aslan get it? They could squabble amongst themselves and
have a series of clan wars. I would think that they'd want to expand into new
territory though.
<P>
<B>Possible scenarios:</B><br>
1) The Safe Aslan do nothing. They stick to Quarantine Patrols but grow
impatient with being hemmed in. The RS would lead one to believe that this
was the case though I'd doubt it.
<P>
2) Pleased with their assaults upon the Florian League, the Aslan decide to
expand to spinward and beat up the various small interstellar states in
Beyond Sector. Possibly, they'd venture into Touchstone & The Vanguard
Reaches but always stay well rimward of the Zhodani Consulate and its client
states.<P>
    2A) The Regency turns a blind eye so long as the Aslan keep up their end
of the Quarantine.<P>
    2B) The Regency condemns the Aslan actions but never physically acts
beyond economic sanctions.<P>
    2C) The Regency intervenes on behalf of the little guys and battles their
ally.
<P>
3) Back to the Hierate!
    3A) With the opening of Corridor to Exit-Only traffic, the Safe Aslan
protest what they view as hypocracy. Having been patient (as per 1 above),
they feel that if the humans can enter Corridor, they should be allowed to
cross the Rift and reclaim the old Hierate. The Regency agrees but insists
that the Aslan maintain the Quarantine just as they are.<P>
    3B) The Safe Aslan have finally exhausted their patience. They threaten
to expand into spinward space unless they're allowed back across the Rift.
The Regency gives in (not wishing to engage in another war with the Aslan,
see more human inhabited worlds taken over, or jeopardize the Quarantine) but
insists that the Aslan maintain the Quarantine.
<P>
Comments? Which of these scenarios seems the most plausible? Are there other
possible scenarios?
