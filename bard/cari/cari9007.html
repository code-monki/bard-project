<H1>Githiaskio</H1>
 <H5>TNE conversion by <A HREF="../../credits.html#pete">Peter Gray</A></h5>
</CENTER>
<HR>
This is a conversion to TNE of the Githiaskio as presented in <cite>GURPS: Traveller Alien Races 3</cite>
 <P>The Githiaskio are a race of sentient
	 acquatic hunters with a startling resemblance to
	 Terran marine mollusks. The "squids" are an
	 intelligent and very adaptive species, whose zero-G
	 and underwater agility made them in high demand for
	 industries related to those environments.
	 <P>
	 The Githiaskio are native to Githiaski (Antares 2406)
	 a water world located on the edge of the Lesser Rift.
	 Suprisingly, the First Imperium apparently was
	 ignorant or uninformed of their existence, and they
	 were not stumbled upon until the Long Night. Githiaski
	 is metal poor, and at any event the race has no native
	 oppurtunity to develop metal working in the confines
	 of their watery home.  The most peculiar aspect of
	 this species is the  suprising similiarity of their
	 psychology to humans. Human and Githiaskio mindsets
	 are suprisingly similar, the result, sophontologists
	 think, of parallels in their evolutionary history.
	 They evolved from omnivorous scavenger-gatherers,
	 moving across the ocean in small family groups that
	 strongly resembled hominid family groups on ancient
	 Earth.
	  <P>
	 Because of their metal poor environment, the aliens
	 advanced to the local equivalent of TL-2, relying
	 heavily on organics and stonework. Among their most
	 spectacular technology included semi-submerged
	 "sailing ships" with streamlined rigging sticking
	 above the water surface, and the hull and living
	 quarters below the surface.  The expansion of the
	 Sylean Empire was welcomed, and Githiaski developed
	 average stellar by the time of the Imperial Civil War
	 (1117 UPP is A789886-C   Wa Ri  830 Im).  The world
	 was incorporated into the League of Antares, and
	 strongly supported the multiracial politics of
	 Archduke Brzk. While the world has been out of contact
	 since the Collapse, large offworld populations of
	 Githiaskio exist in coreward and spinward portions of
	 the old Third Imperium, including several in the
	 current boundaries of the Regency of Deneb.
	  <P>
	<h3>Biology</h3><P> The Gitiaskio are radially symetrical,
	 bisexual and semi-homeothermic. They have 1.8 to 2.4
	 meter long tapering bodies, that are about 45 to 50
	 centimeters in diameter.  They possess six suckered
	 tentacles which are used for manipulation, restraining
	 and feeding. They possess two large compound eyes, but
	 vision is optimised for the acquatic environment, and
	 they are insensitive to reds and yellows.  Primary
	 sense is sound, and their hearing is almost as good as
	 a Dolphins underwater. Githiaskio females bear a
	 single live young. Lifespans are about roughly
	 equivalent to humans.
	  <P>
	 Locomotion is provided by movement of the tentacles;
	 unlike Terran mollusks, they do not possess the abilty
	 to jet water. Also unlike mollusks, they possess an
	 internal skeleton made of strong connective tissue
	 almost equivalent in toughness to vertebrate
	 skeletons. They are poor long distance swimmers, and
	 prefer to swim tentacles forward.  They are poor
	 hunters, and their traditional food was either
	 scrounged from local reefs and ocean floors, or was
	 carrion.  They can tolerate depths of up to 700 meters
	 under 1G, but are less well adapted greater depths,
	 and nearly all Githiaskio possess a natural phobia of
	 going deeper, similar to the human fear of heights.
	 They are oxygen breathers, but can only respire in
	 water on worlds with a thin atmosphere or better. They
	 can withstand variable salinities, but they are highly
	 sensitive to water tainted by pollution or local
	 atmospheric conditions, and will refuse to enter any
	 body of water so contaminated. A Githiaskio stranded
	 out of water will die of dehydration within five
	 minutes.
	  <P>
	 <h3>Relations with the Imperium/Regency</h3><P> The great
	 similarity between Human and Githiasko mindsets
	 permitted a close relationship between the "Squids"
	 and Imperial culture humans. Relations with other
	 species and races are very human-like as well. The
	 main Squid communities in the Regency are on
	 Taillon/Inar (Deneb 1415) and a smaller one on Beaxon
	 (Deneb 0439). They are heavily involved in various
	 industrial and skilled professions on several worlds
	 with water compatible with their needs. Most
	 Githiaskio will be encountered on either such worlds,
	 or in low or zero gravity serving in a number of
	 professions and occupations.
	  <P>
	 Since the Collapse, Regency Githiaskio have developed
	 a very low opinion of Vargr, with whom their race had
	 poor relationship to begin with.  Their attitudes
	 toward Virus closely mirror their Human counterparts
	 as well, and there exists no shortage of Squid
	 volunteers for sign up with the military or RQS.
	 Relations with the Aslan are similiarly poor, the
	 result of several confrontations between Fait Accompli
	 lords and several Githiaskio communes in the Thinrim.
	  <P>
	 <h3>Githiaskio Language</h3><P> Their language is a complex
	 series of whistles, clicks and grunts. Both Humans and
	 Githiaskio can learn the other's language, but at one
	 level of difficulty greater for task resolution. Cheap
	 TL 10 computer translators eliminated most need for
	 either race to learn the other's language, and these
	 are cheaply available on most Regency worlds of TL9+
	 (Weight: 250 kg, Price: 300 Cr.)
	  <P>
	 The Githiaskio word for themselves is Whooiihee, and
	 for their world is Llaaaiihoin. Their personal names
	 are long and complex, and most Squids adopt Anglic
	 nicknames when working with humans or on human worlds.
	  <P>
	 <h3>Githiaskio Technology</h3><P> Largely analogous to human
	 equipment, with a few important modifications.  Most
	 electronics and complex machinery must be waterproofed
	 or made water resistant; this will increase the cost
	 of their technology by 20%.  Squids can manipulate and
	 fire human or Vargr guns with little trouble, though
	 it requires two or three tentacles to do so.  In their
	 native environment, Githiaskio prefer to swim, but out
	 of water, whether in dry air or in space, special
	 water flooded vehicles and spacecraft must be used.
	 These must be sealed against all non-waterine or
	 hostile environments.  Specialised vacc suits and
	 non-Battledress encounter suits are available, and are
	 required by Githiaskio if they are to enter tainted
	 water, or dive on a world of atmosphere 3- or A+,  but
	 these cost double to make. Githiaskio battledress
	 exists, but all armor mass on the rigid armor table
	 must be doubled, with the legs and head deleted, but
	 must calculate for six arms.
	  <P>
	 All life support equipment prices are doubled, and
	 specially made workstations costing 200 cr more must
	 be allocated. These vehicles and ships must constantly
	 carry water, and this adds 1.0 metric tons per cubic
	 meter intended for habitation. Because of this
	 restriction, many Squid ships are designed along the
	 lines of human deep submergence subs, building a
	 smaller "pressure hull" that is flooded at all times,
	 leaving the other sections either perpetually dry, or
	 selectively flooded when they are used, in which case
	 ballast tanks are required to flood or drain a hull
	 section.
	  <P>
	 <h3>Githiaskio Character Generation</h3><P>
	  <P>
	 Before generating Githiaskio characters, their
	 disadvantages must be noted</h3><P> They are confined to
	 water with sufficient oxygen and a lack of pollutants
	 or atmospheric taint. They possess poor vision, and
	 they are sensitive to bright light.  And their
	 tentacles aren't as adept at gripping things as human
	 hands.
	 Rolling a Githiaskio character is as per TNE rules
	 with the following changes to attributes</h3><P>
	  <P>

	 <table border=0>
	 <TR><TD>STR <TD>2D6-2
	 <TR><TD>AGL <TD>2D6-2
	 <TR><TD>END <TD>2D6+1
	 <TR><TD>INT <TD>2D6-1
	 <TR><TD>EDU <TD>2D6-1
	 <TR><TD>CHR <TD>2D6-1
	 </table>
	 The rolled charism is for other Githiaskio, it is halved in regards to
	 other races.
	  <P>
	 All Githiaskio characters have a default swimming
	 skill asset of 3, and may substitute this for Zero-G
	 environment skill at a penalty of -1.
	  <P>
	 Githiaskio are capable of doing three to six
	 independent manual tasks with their tentacles at a
	 Diff. +1. They may do two tasks at normal difficulty,
	 and one task at Diff. -1. These only count for
	 strength and agility based tasks.
	  <P>
	 Recruitment and education are as per the TNE rulebook.
	 They may enter any career, and learn any skill.
	 Squids are most commonly encountered in RQS/RISS,
	 construction worker and academic careers away from
	 their homeworld or outside their offworld communities.
	  <P>
	 Githiaskio psionic potential is about the same as
	 humans. However they must role for telekinesis and
	 arcane talents with an additional +2 DM.
	  <P>
	 Roleplaying Githiaskio is comparatively easy compared
	 to other alien races because of their human-like
	 mindset. However, historically the Squids have been
	 very defensive about being labelled a minor race, and
	 in the past have vigorously defended themselves
	 against outside hecklers and bigots. Since the
	 Collapse, though, the distinction between Major and
	 Minor Races has become moot, and this tendency has
	 subsided in the Regency. But Githiaskio have a well
	 deserved reputation for loud and vociferous
	 complaining, especially when some dumbass human is
	 trying to compell them to enter tainted water or dive
	 beyond their physical capability.
