<HR><p>
The Zhodani Consulate is now only 45% of its pre-1119
extents.
<P>
The Consulate is effectively dead, as the Supreme
Council and its attendant bureaucracies are inert and
irrelevant.  But it retains nominal control over
Consulate territory in Zhdant, Tienspevnekr, Tsadra,
Yiklerzdranzh, Far Frontiers, Foreven, Ziafrplians and
Spinward Marches Sectors. This region is referred to
as the Zhodani Safe. Local sector and provincial
councils are now the primary authorities, a fact that
creates a good deal of confusion now that Zhdant has
been discredidated.  Most of the original nobility has
been displaced by local military commanders and
warlords, and internal frontiers are beginning to
appear, marked by custom checkpoints and new taxation
levies.
<P>
While law and order still hold sway here, the region
has been devastated by the mass evacuation of people
known as the Zhodani Exodus.  Low pop worlds near the
warzone have been abandoned, and population flows have
overwhelmed transport assets. Don't even think about
trying to ship anything into the core reaches of the
Zhodani Safe, there's no ships to carry anything.  The
only reason that people are no longer leaving the
region in droves is that most of the ships have gone
to the Regency, or to other neighboring states, and
they're not coming back. The only ships still running
are commandeered military transports, and those
belonging to Clotho or Droyne merchants.
<P>
Those people remaining on coreward safe worlds are a
squirrely bunch: scared, suspicious and, unusually for
Zhos, armed to the teeth.  With so many Zho psions
dead in the wake of the 1119 and 1149 rebellions, or
fled to the Regency, the Tavrchedl are few in number
here, and most Zhodani proles have to improvise
security procedures, and many are trigger-jerky in
tense situations.  Most communities are still sorting
out ways to replace the missing or dead nobles, and
this creates new tensions, as the proles are still
unused to having to sort things out on their own.
<P>
Only in the most rimward parts of the Consulate will
you find things running as they should be.  But even
here the local authorities are coasting on inertia.
They've done little to accomodate incoming refugees,
and tussles between displaced proles and the locals
are becoming breeding grounds for further hostility
and possible Three Hundred Tempest inspired unrest. To
make matters worse, the local Tavrchedl are mostly
green recruits, paranoid as hell about terrorist
attacks, and liable to use some very un-Zhodani like
coercion to control the situation.  Regency citizens
need to be careful here, as there are a lot of
desperate people who jockey hard for a bunk on refugee
ships, and everything from bribery to minor scuffles
are being reported between Zho citizens and Regency
shipmasters, and threats of more drastic action have
arisen in current months.
<P>
However, the regions adjacent to the Regency are
probably the safest places in all of Charted Space, in
spite of intra-Zhodani fighting.  The guy in charge of
Iadr Nobl province, which includes everything in the
Marches, has effectively cast off his ties to Zhdant,
and has secured the loyalty of most of Foreven and
Ziafrplians military and nobility (with the notable
exception of Shivva/Foreven's subsector councils and
nobles).
<P>
The upper third of Zhdant, Tienspevekr and the upper
half of Ziafprilians are equivalent to Hard Times
factional frontiers, only under the control of local
noble and prole leaders, and the Three Hundred Tempest
and Dawn Heralder religious factions. Fighting here is
frequent and heavy, and xenophobia and crazed refugees
are rampant. While the Dawn Heralders have managed to
secure coreward Ziafprilians, and there is some
cooperation between the local warlords, the main
contributing factor has been the continuing
fragmentation of the Three Hundred Tempest.
<P>
Parts of the cult have been spinning off for years to
follow this charismatic leader, or that one.  So there
is a constant drum-beat of small fanatic attacks on
the frontier, but the coordination is gone, as is
their logistic base.  But some of the local cult
leaders have taken to simple genocide rather than
attacking local military forces.  The region is a
mess.  Everyone is packing heat, and with all of the
competing factions firefights are as common as
hayfever.  There has been considerable tech level
regression, and many local governments have broken
down into restrained anarchy. The cult leaders and
older warlords are being replaced with gangs of young
kids and teenage soldiers who have no compunctions
against killing you for your shaving kit if one of
them took a hankering to it. Its not all that bad
everywhere, especially where the Dawn Heralders are in
charge.  But there's rumors that they've pretty much
given up on preserving the region, and are planning to
pull back into the safe, in hopes of preserving order
where it still exists, and helping transform what
remains of Zho society into a more stable form.
<P>
Beyond the Frontier is the Nomad Wilds.  These are the
main battlegrounds of the Zhodani Collapse.  they get
their names from the simple fact that many of the
worlds are too badly damaged to support life, and
roving fleets of scavengers are needed to secure the
resources for survival. The Zdiediant/Stiatlchepr
interface was where the 1119 and 1149 rebellions
occured.  The place is now a garbage dump, and most
fighting is between desperate people over scarce
resources.  The "four corners" where Itviskiastaf,
Stiatlchepr, Ziafprilians and Tienspevnekr Sectors
meet, are the current center of Three Hundred Tempest
activities.  It is not recommended for travel.  While
not anti-Regency, the increasing fragmentation of the
group, and the fanatical savagery shown to unbelieving
Zho populations make them an unpopular destination;
plus you're likely to be marked by their opponents as
fair game.
<P>
A few pocket empires have come and gone in this
region, including a couple that are rather friendly to
the Regency. Of course they happen to be on the far
side of the Three Hundred Tempest.
<P>
Beyond the Nomad Wilds is the Wasteland.  It was
originally called that by the Zhodani in pre-Collapse
times, but it now includes the outer rimward halves of
Itvikstiaf, Statlcheper, Zdiedient and all of Sidliadl
sectors, and this time it's an accurate description.
This is where the fighting ended only when they ran
out of warm bodies to continue.  The cults and the
factions then moved on, and then Virus moved in,
wiping out most of what remained.  This is pure Wilds,
as bad as anywhere else.
<P>
The reasons that Virus hasn't swamped the local
factions are actually idiotically simple.  Only
Chiterabl and the other coreward regions were hit with
the early suicide strains.  Currently, most strains in
the Wasteland are Puppeteers and Parents, and these
are less interested in bringing worlds crashing around
peoples ears.  Moreover, the factions are all heavily
armed and paranoid, and most Vamps don't survive
scrutiny for very long. And finally there's the fact
that Virus had to enter into the Consulate through the
sparsely populated areas adjacent to its coreward
border, and had relatively few targets of infection
after several decades of hellish combat.
<P>
Of course there is no denying that they are doing
major damage. The Wasteland is as dead as Wilds
anywhere, and it is beginning to spread farther into
the Consulate as the factions continue to retreat. Nor
are there any pocket empires here; unlike virus, the
factional militaries destroyed everything of value
over a decade ago, and left the people to fend for
themselves. The Zho's far coreward territories were
cut off by the 1119 rebellion, and then annihilated by
virus in the mid-1140s.  The last Zho core expedition,
in reality a quixotic military mission attempting to
reconquer the affected regions, got as far as
Stiatlchepr's subsector B before Three Hundred Tempest
ambushes and traitor units of former sector governor
cornered and wiped them out.  If any of the deep core
territories have survived virus, they're on their own,
probably for the next 200 years, if anyone can get a
handle on the situation. (Author's note: barring
recontact by Avery's fleet, of course.)
<P>
TAS has not gotten off its butt yet to classify travel
conditions, owing to the poor intelligence it has
gotten from its sources.  Technically, the Zhodani
Safe is green, but don't put much faith in that, given
its unstable boundaries.  The Zhodani "Hard Frontiers"
range anywhere from Amber to Red.  And the Wilds,
Nomad and Wasteland alike, are no-go. To make things
more confusing, local interdictions are often in
effect for worlds that do not need them, or are not in
effect for those that do, a result of political
infighting in the safe.
<P>
Regency-Consulate trade, never very significant to
begin with, has gone in contradictory directions since
the Exodus began.   With an economic downturn as a
result of the civil war and massive population
evacuations, there is little incentive to buy
manufactured goods from the Regency. Another obstacle
has been continued export bans leftover from the
Imperial period. Most goods being shipped into the
Consulate are related to construction and ship
production. Manufacturing machinery has been in heavy
demand in the border regions, the result of the
evacuations and the abandonment of most Zhodani heavy
manufacturing base near the frontier.
<P>
Opposing this contraction is a massive market for
labor and skilled workers. Security personel are in
heavy demand to back-up factional and regional
security forces in everything from crowd-control and
refugee resettlement, to convoy protection and vampire
hunting. Those areas of the Safe hit by the Exodus are
much more desperate, given the loss of skilled
workers. With every industry from munitions
manufacturing to utilities to agriculture hurting for
labor, Regency contract employees with only basic
Zhodani-language skills can earn premium prices.
<P>
Quarantine restrictions have tightened along the
Regency-Consulate interface in regards to non-Exodus
shipping. Regency shippers returning from the
Consulate can expect more delays at the border, but no
other effects. Moving in the opposite direction is
more difficult, with both Quarantine inspections and a
growing number of naval "checkpoints" to impede
travel. Surface customs have become especially
onerous, non-Zhodani subject to mental "pat-downs"
from heavily armed Tavrchedl, being restricted to
special trade or residence zones, or just barred from
planetary surfaces altogether.
<P>
Despite rumors that the Regency is beginning to ship
"donkey" versions of TL 15 gear through Corellian
League to their allies in Zhodani space, private
gunrunning is not welcome within the safe or frontier,
and shipments are usually confiscated, and the
offending ship impounded.  Of course this has as much
to do with cynicism as much as enlightened policy.
This attitude is present everywhere, no matter which
faction you're dealing with. Other contraband is iffy,
and it pays to have either contacts or do your
homework before trying to smuggle anything in.
<P>
Finally, one reminder.  Despite their troubles, the
Zhodani still retain a sense of community, perhaps
even more so today.  Where they were once sheep, the
crises of the past 83 years have raised the awareness
and participation of proles significantly. They are
not going to be passive victims of the universe
anymore. They take even less kindly to aggressors and
intruders today than ever before.  Todays Zhos have a
lot of firepower and little patience for
victimization.<P>

<h3>Wasteland</h3>

The fighting in the Consulate has had
more of an on-again, off-again pace to it than the
"Grapes Of Wrath" campaigning that characterised the
Imperial Civil War.  Unlike the Imperials, the Zhos
were hit hard by their military losses in the Fifth
Frontier War, and were forced to build up their
militaries for the eventual breakup.
<P>
Most of the fighting between 1119 and 1190 is
positional, limited guerilla action and localised
brushfire wars between Zho factions, and attempted
indoctrination of selected populations.  Contrary to
the way it is depicted in RS, the breakup of the
Consulate was actually a slow, subtle unraveling,
which is why the Regency had a difficult time
determining their neighbor's true circumstances. It
was like the prelude to a landslide: more and more
pressure is exerted on a slope by the unstable layer
of rock above, until it finally exceeds friction and
causes a catastrophic collapse.  The period of
1119-1190 is the accumulation of pressure, and the
subsequent rush of violence is the rockfall.
<P>
Since 1190 a "patchwork" of minor polities and
personal fiefs have emerged, of varying health and
stability.  The good news is that most of these areas
are on the average in better shape than Hard Times
Imperium. The bad news is that there no longer exists
a unified defense against virus, and the porosity of
these regions is permitting a steady infiltration of
virus strains, and some Vampire activity as well.
<P>
The Wasteland was essentially exhausted by the
fighting, and the remnants were left for Virus to pick
over. The Nomad Wilds are a mixture of marauders,
factional soldiers and an increasing number of
Vampires.  It is not too difficult to imagine some of
the local powers even making alliances with the less
malicious strains.....
<P>
...excuse me.... <<SHUDDER>>
<P>
Which makes me wonder about the fine line between
decency, and the temptation to use Vampires as an
adjunct to local military forces.
<P>
BTW I accept the 1150s date for infection of Chiterabl
and the Far Core.  Most of the strains that made it
this far were a crazy-quilt mob of strains ranging
from surviving Reproducers to, strangely enough, a
fair number of Prophet viruses ("Lucan commands you to
annihilate the psionic monsters.") The main vector was
just a handful of Vargr trading vessels that plied the
core-trailing quadrant, that inviegled a passage
around the main quarantine line to trailing, to hit
the Core Axis.
<P>
And contrary to Regency intel, there were a number of
successful penetrations of Zho Quarantine along their
border with the Vargr, particularly the Democracy of
Greats.  These were classic Vampires that attacked
isolated outposts, though the Zhos suffered a couple
of Trin level apocalypses to a Vampire fleet made up
of large Vargr battlewagons in 1157. The last event is
noteworthy in that it increased the level of paranoia
between factions to a fever pitch, forcing most of
them to spurn a unified Quarantine in favor of
localised defenses. This is the point that the
Consulate ceased to exist as a unified state.


<h2> The Great Thud. (Zhodane 799-979)</h2>

<h3> The Stalwarts</h3>

The simplest way to explain the "how, what, where and
why" of Zhdant's current crisis, we have to go back
about four hundred years, to the Crisis of '99, in
order to understand its beginnings.
<P>
The Crisis of '99 is the war scare of 799, when an
increasingly agitated Imperium confronted the Zhodani
Consulate over its meddling in its internal affairs.
The Raison de'Etre for the crisis was a government
change on Attica/Querion, when the Tozjabr helped
install a pro-Zhodani government in defiance of
Imperial objections.  Since the Second Frontier War,
the Zhodani "Peace Faction" had operated in a
provocative and aggressive fashion in seeming
contradiction to its own name and intended goals.  It
had ignored Imperial sovereignty, influenced psionic
institutes, and posted a large number of Tojzabr
agents around the Imperiums spinward borders to
influence its neighbors and dissenting elements.  The
Attica crisis was the last straw, and the Imperium, to
Zhdants suprise, issued an ultimatum: Get out of our
internal affairs or face the consequences.
<P>
The Zhodani Consulate of 799-826 had reached a
crossroads in its existence.  A hermetic socialist
state that preferred isolationism from non-psionic
societies, it had nourished a system that was immature
and blankly naive about the universe outside, and
unsuited for coexistence with other large powers.  The
Third Imperium's expansion into the Iakr Sector
(Spinward Marches) and its subsequent development
unnerved it, leading to the first two disastrous
Frontier Wars and the excessive activities that
created the Crisis of '99 in the first place.  The
misnamed Peace Party had existed in a fantasy land,
and had pursued policies that left the Consulate in a
weakened state.  Their sins were incompetence and
naivete. Capitulation to the Imperium's demands
brought about their ouster from the Supreme Council.
<P>
The party that succeeded it was the Fieqrnokl (pro.
"Fake-nokel"), or "Stalwarts", and contrary to their
conservative visage, they were cut from a more
responsible mold.  Zhodani weakness in 799 had shocked
them into a more pragmatic appraisal of the Consulate,
and they had a grasp of fundamentals, and much reason
to be dismayed.  The Consulate was a narrow,
one-dimensional society under great stress from the
Third Imperium. Not because of their lack of morality,
or anti-psionic bias (the Consulate was reponsible for
this after all), but because of the Imperium's success
in spite of those limitations.  Unlike their
predecessors, the Fieqrnokl accepted that there was
something to the Imperium that defied their sense of
order, something that had validity. Their appraisal of
the Imperium never escaped the narrow traditional bias
that had existed before, but it was an improvement
because it dealt with limitations and real facts.
<P>
The bottom line was this: the Consulate was losing the
race to the Imperium.  The Consulate had invented the
jump drive in -5415, but six thousand years later it
had barely reached TL 13, rivaling the Ziru Sirka for
stagnation.  Aside from the Core Expeditions, Zhodani
science had stagnated, industry was sclerotic, and
basic research barely crawled along.  The Third
Imperium had started at TL 11/12 just a few hundred
years before, attained technological parity during the
first two Frontier Wars, and had bypassed them just in
time for the Crisis of '99.  The Consulate had 5,000
systems with stagnant populations, the Imperium had
11,000 growing points of light.  Even in psionic
research, the Third Imperium threatened to pull ahead
in areas that the Consulate had never considered.
<P>
When Zhodani refer to the dangers of Imperial
"expansion" they were referring to it economically,
technologically and socially, and not to actual
physical expansion.  Imperial power, whether good or
bad, upset the traditional deliberateness of Zhodani
society and made no apologies for its transgression.
The dilemma of the Fieqrnokl was to somehow balance
the Imperium's power against Zhodani conservatism, and
somehow preserve the prevailing psionic order in the
process.  Despite this new mood of rationalism, there
still existed a severe anti-Imperial sentiment within
the security services, centered around a bizarre group
called the Inschatejtesh (thats "Ensh-ah-tege-tesh")
that will be discussed shortly, that amplified the
Stalwarts own militancy.
<P>
Reform of the Consulate was the Fieqrnokls main
agenda. But how do you reform the incorrigible?  The
main strengths of the Imperium, the ones that they
wanted to emulate, were those in direct contradiction
to the psionic socialism that the Stalwarts depended
upon.  In order for Zhodani society to be saved, they
would have to destroy it to make way for a new
synthesis or ideology.  And the Fieqrnokl were not in
the business of putting themselves out of business, so
the reforms they pursued were a lukewarm mixture of
new technological/economic initiatives, and heightened
hostility towards the Imperium.
<P>
Some social freedoms were enacted, along with some
attempt at alternative institutions.  But these went
nowhere in the face of official queasiness, and these
efforts confused the majority of Zhodani proles,
frustrated dissenters, and inflamed the Consulates
harried minor races.  While Zho society had been
largely free of contradictions, the pre-Fifth War
government had committed itself to a contradictory
path between admiring and despising the Imperium, and
oscillating between a bevy of opposing positions. This
dissension never appeared publicly because it only
contributed more stagnation.  The only region of
consensus was the need for a stronger military stance,
leading to an extended military buildup from the 850s
until the Fifth Frontier War.

<h3>The Mother's Cross</h3>
<P>
As the Fieqrnokl tried to reconcile the
irreconcilable, traditionalists quickly tired of their
seesawing zig-zags.  Most of these groups were purged
in the early 900s after an abortive coup attempt, and
the Fieqrnokl attempted to stack the Supreme Council
with factions that were fashioned somewhat in their
own image.  Most of these groups were just variations
of their own theme.  But there was one radically
different, though it carefully concealed its origin.
<P>
This was the Inschatejtesh, or Masters of Secrets.
Privately they called themselves the Ranzh Viatl, the
"Mother's Cross." Neither name should be reason for
encouragement.  They were a mixture of political
party, masonic secret society, political advocacy
committee and private foundation.  They were younger
nobles of high rank, aggressive military officers and
rogue intellectuals.  They advocated a hard line
against the Imperium, and carried out public
gatherings and arcane secret private meetins that had
an eerie familiarity to them. Their leaders all had
one thing in common: they had all visited Terra.
<P>
The Sol. Hypothesis doesn't have any mystical hold
upon the other human races, since the matter of a fact
holds no mystery at all.  The same couldn't be said
about Terra itself, and there is ample documentation
of a kind of Jerusalem Syndrome that non-Solomani
experienced there, as the dry fact that Earth is where
Humanity began doesn't prepare a person for actually
being in proximity to it.  OK, thats an exaggeration,
but the fact remains that Terra was THE place for
Zhodani nobles of means and time to visit during the
Antebellum period.  Among the Zhodani nobility, to
have visited Terra was a cachet for respectability, of
group elevation.  So popular was Terra that Perth,
Australia became known as "Little Zhdant" for the
large expatriate community that accumulated there,
which was remarkable for the distance they came to get
here.<P>

But in the poisoned atmosphere of the Solomani
Autonomous Region of the early 900s, most Zhodani
entered Solomani space from the Aslan Hierate, through
Magyar Sector, home to some of the most stunted human
societies ever to blight its good name. Early
precursors of SolSec, like the Wuan Security Service
and the Dootchen Estates Overseer attempted to recruit
some of these nobles as psionic instructors or agents.
The distance between the Zhodani and Solomani was too
great to bridge for an effective alliance.
Unfortunately, in the usual banal tradition of
Solomani racist organisations anywhere, these nobles
were often "initiated" in the philosophy and secret
rituals of these groups.
<P>
These nobles had come to Terra as tourists seeking
some kind of transformation from undertaking in the
popular ritual. While the nobles that encountered
these groups were unimpressed by the assertion of
Solomani superiority (but then who is?), they had come
from a society that was under great pressure, and
increasingly adrift.  Young, pampered and
undisciplined, they were impressed by those aspects of
these groups stressing order, discipline and the
regenerative tonic of violence.
<P>
The Mother's Cross you should have guessed is the old
"Crosshairs", the ancient Greek symbol of Earth.
These nobles would elevate the traditional emphasis on
psionics into a commandment, stressing it as the
natural end of Human evolution after the Ancients had
come to Terra, and that the Zhodani had been chosen to
bring that end into reality. To call them a fascist
group is too strong, as their willingness to effect
their goals meant they were unwilling to challenge the
mainstream parties, diluting their extremism.
<P>
But they were very well organised, and their advocacy
and assistance of Zhodani institutions endeared them
to both reactionaries and the Fieqrnokl majority.
They clustered in the Tozjabr and the military
Tavrchedl, becoming the triggermen of the Council,
carrying out any disagreeable act.  Most of the worst
Zhodani "mind-f**ks" affected on occupied populations
in wartime can be attributed to their philosophy. In
time they so submerged their activities into
mainstream organisations that from the Third Frontier
War onwards they vanished, though their organisations
and companies remained in business.
<P>
What no one seems to have questioned was their
"Zhodani-ness."  While the elevation of psionics into
an eschatological culmination wasn't a stretch, their
admiration for violence as a righteous means and then
as an end in of itself was an alien innovation
unrelated to anything prior.  A major slice of Zhodani
government became enamored of military organisation,
concentration and execution, and this would have
tragic results in the period of 1100-1120.<P>

<h3>Summary:</h3><P>

The Zhodani Consualate was controlled by the
Fieqrnokl, a reform party with no real program of
reform, abetted within the security services by the
Inschatejtesh, a militant quasi-fascist organisation
that had no political program beyond an admiration for
decisive acts of political violence.  They both
admired and despised the Imperium for its strengths,
and both had a vested interest in the status quo.  And
in the end both discovered that war was an attractive
alternative to real reform.

<h3>The Empress Wave</h3>
The Empress Wave reached the Zhodani Consulate most
coreward borders in Chit Botshi, Dlachie Jdatl and
Driasera Sectors in 921-922, but the major impact of
the Wave didn't hit the Zhodani Core until the 990s.
The Zhodani government had evidence of the Wave going
back thousands of years, and had ample evidence of its
impact upon psionic individuals, and made
preparations. A separate division within the Tavrchedl
specifically trained and equipped for handling the
wave and its casualties, was mobilized and
concentrated within the Wave's main path.
<P>
Despite these preparations, the Wave's power could not
be denied, and even these specialised units suffered
from attrition to wave psychosis.  The Wave Effect
could last as long as a decade in the affected area,
severly straining Consulate control and resources, and
guaranteeing massive reeducation in its wake.  The
Zhodani called the EW the Viajia, literally "Hammer",
and began mass quarantines of the nobility in the 2-3
parsec strip surrounding the Wavefront.
<P>
The Wave is a difficult phenomenon to describe, and
the Zhodani never understood its nature or means of
propagation. To put it simply, the Empress Wave was a
trough of agitated space, a ripple through
quintessence as it were, that had a very strong
psionic component. The forefront of the wave was
percieved by psions in various manners depending upon
the talent of the individual.  But most encountered
lucid visions and "pregnant" dreams similar to those
experienced by the Dynam Depot relay, Johnathan
Crocker.  And all of them depicted a woman, though the
descriptions and details do not match the Pentecost
data.
<P>
The middle part of the trough, called the trailing
wall, contained more energy than the forewave. Psions
were assualted by feelings of levity, hilarity,
hallucinations and waking dreams, wild fluctuations in
power, spontaneous psionic activity and psychotic
reactions.  Some psions, particulary Clairvoyants,
went into shock and even comas.  And regardless of
power, all Zhodani psions in the area of the wave were
affected.  Entire councils had to be replaced on a
rotating basis, with the affected psions placed in
convalescent facilities, spending years in recovery.
<P>
The social shock, despite precautions, was
devastating. The familiar local nobility broke down
into discomfiting behavior under the pressure of the
wave, often for years at a time. And then they were
whisked away from their posts to be replaced with
younger and more inexperienced nobles who were
unfamiliar to the locals. Meanwhile, during those
"lost years" during the height of the wave's effects,
the proles had to develop a degree of self-sufficiency
until the old order could be stabilised and recovered.

<P>
The result of this was growing alienation within the
coreward regions of the Consulate, made worse by
official silence of the Councils on noble matters.
Though no rebellions broke out, post-Viajia regions
came down with a chronic case of inarticulated
distrust and paranoia that proved difficult for
reeducation to eradicate.  The Consulate did manage to
smooth appearances, giving the proles in unaffected
regions no inkling of a crisis, and interdicting the
information from reaching its neighbors, friend or
foe.
<P>
Zhodani philosophy had one advantage over the Third
Imperium: it was repelled by the kind of
self-destructive behavior that culminated into the
Collapse.  The kind of behavior that created the
weapons of mass destruction and war of all against all
are alien concepts to the Zhodani mindset.  Zhodani
society emphasises the utility of its citizenry, and
the orderliness of communal health and proper public
virtue. The "domestication" of Zhodani proles was the
rationalisation of utilitarian order, of the greatest
good for the greatest number.
<P>
Zho socialism has more in common with the liberalism
of Jeremy Bentham than with Karl Marx (indeed,
psionics is the only way that Bentham's rationalist
utilitarianism could ever have worked). Zho society is
the early 19th century dream of orderly society come
true: a charitable aristocratic elite presiding over
an orderly, well behaved working class made content
with its leaders and community.
<P>
But the Empress Wave damaged that order in a
fundamental manner that proved difficult to repair,
and eventually unravelled the entire social order.
And the reason why was the very success of the Zhodani
way of life.  The Zhodani elites were so successful in
the propagation and acceptance of their society, that
their ideology hardened into certitude.  They weren't
suffering from hubris, but from a very narrow view of
the universe, one afforded by the lack of any major
crises throughout most of their history. Without any
compelling need for societal flexibility, the
tradeoffs between conformity and prosperity were
accepted as a matter of course by all levels of Zho
society. Their success encouraged the elite and the
proles to think that the Zhodani way was ONLY way for
human society to ever exist. The Tavrchedl discouraged
any open questioning of that order, and no
alternatives were tolerated, because the implied that
the Consulate wasn't a perfect utopia.
<P>
The EW struck the Consulate at its most vulnerable
location, the psionically talented individuals that
formed the backbone of their culture, and suddenly the
Zhodani found they needed an alternative, if only for
a little while, to keep the system in working order.
There were three levels that spelled trouble.  First
of all, it appeared that the Consulate's emphasis upon
psionics had created a mental "monoculture" that was
vulnerable to disruption.  Second of all, the need to
devolve authority to the proles in affected areas
implied that there was indeed room for alternatives;
if the proles could be trusted with self-governance,
even for a little while, then perhaps the nobility was
a luxury.
<P>
But the third level was put forward by Brenchievstebr:
The Consulates assertion of absolute certainty was
rendered false by the Wave.  Zhodani society was based
upon the guarantee that psionics were the end all, be
all of human existence, and the means for perfection.
This implied omniscience.  But the ignorance of the
wave, the vulnerability it revealed, and the
un-Zhodani contigencies it drove destroyed the
authority that the elites had depended upon.  Zhodani
society held no contradictions or deep resentments;
logically it was sound.  But the lack of logical error
is not the same as a lack of factual correctness.  And
the inability of the Consulate to handle the EW was a
nontrivial fact.
<P>
But in the face of that fact, the Consulate refused to
sacrifice its claim to omniscience, acting as if
nothing had happened, and thereby creating the impetus
for rebellion.
