<H3>Geneered marsupial macropod </h3>

     During the Rule of Man, Terran colonists took a number of animals with 
     them when they settled new worlds. One of these animals was the Terran 
     kangaroo, which proved capable of surviving in a range of semi-arid 
     Earthlike environments, produced large quantities of medium-quality 
     meat and was tough and fast enough to deter or escape a large number 
     of predators. <p>
     
     Late in the Rule of Man era, genetic engineers developed an 
     intelligent variant of the kangaroo; as the core animal was 
     already bipedal and possessed rudimentary 'arms', minimal 
     genetic adjustment was necessary. Aside from slightly more 
     developed arms, five fingered 'hands' and a broader and longer 
     braincase, "Roos" (or K'rr'tik*ka as they term themselves - the 
     symbolic '*' denotes a subsonic deep-chest grunt that humans 
     find impossible to replicate) appear very similar to their 
     animal forebears. Non-visible genetic differences are also 
     minor, and are mainly biochemical and circulatory changes 
     related to supporting an enlarged brain. <p>
     
     Because of their mouth and vocal structure, Roos are incapable 
     of speaking Galanglic or any other human tongue, but have their 
     own sophisticated languages based on tonal variations of grunts, 
     barks, howls and clicks. Roos generally have access to 
     electronic translators of various kinds. <p>
     
     Most Roos are located in the Solomani Rim; they are rarely found 
     to coreward of Diaspora sector. Scattered pockets of Roos can be 
     found far to rimward of Terra. <p>


     I suggest that uplifted animals have 1d6 rolls for INT, EDU and SOC; 
     and physical stats based upon their physical abilities. <p>
