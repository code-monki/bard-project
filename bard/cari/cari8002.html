<h3>Physiology</h3>

<p>
      The Tapazmali perhaps differ the least of all the minor
human races from their Terran
ancestors. What few distinctions they have will be discussed below.
 <p>     <b>Height and Weight</b>: They are slightly shorter than many other minor
humans. Males stand about 1.5 meters tall, and females average only slightly
shorter. Their weight, approximately 65 kg, generally falls within usual human
norms - despite their shorter stature.
 <p>     <b>Appearance</b>: They have a somewhat stocky appearance. It is not obesity, a
phenomenon almost totally unknown among the Tapazmali. Well-built and
muscular, Tapazmali generally are broader in the chest than other humans. This
is perhaps the most noticeable thing about their appearance.
  <p>    Their skin tone is somewhat light, but by no means albino. Hair is
generally curly and of lighter colors like blond and grey. Grey and platinum
hair colors are not uncommon, and occur even among the very young.
 <p>    <b> Diet</b>: Like most humans, Tapazmali are omnivorous. Most eat only two
large meals a day. (This practice may have evolved because of the scarcity of
food in the mountainous regions where the Tapazmali evolved. It continues.)
  <p>    Tapazmali eat well, and seem to have an almost innate knack of knowing
what foods will be best for them. Thus, when one is sick, he or she will eat
only those deemed best to facilitate health. This knack is not entirely
instinctual, having been taught from childhood, but it seems so to outsiders.
  <p>   <b> Reproduction</b>: Women give birth after a gestation period of between 10
and 11 months. Multiple births are entirely unheard of, at least in recent
history. Furthermore, females are only fertile during a single season of the
year. These factors combine to create low population growth among Tapazmali.
 <p>     Since these factors deviate greatly from the human norm, it has been
suggested that perhaps they were geneered into the Tapazmali by the Ancients.
Such would have been wise since food was scarce on their mountain heights.
<p>

      <b>Senses</b>: Tapazmali exhibit the usual human senses with no variation in
their efficiency. The seemingly innate ability to select the best food for
themselves is not an additional sense, but leaves that impression. To other
humans, Tapazmali are "known" for their supposed instinctual ability to find
good foods.
  <p>

    <b>Anatomy</b>: The only changes from human norms are the possible geneered
changes in fertility. Blood types include A, B, O, and P, with the dominant
types being A and B.
   <p>

  <b> Lifespan</b>: Tapazmali lifespans are longer than many human races. While
they do not rival the Vilani longevity, many live to be 120 years old or
older. Like the lower birth rate, this seems to be an adaptation.

<h3>Psychology</h3>
<p>
  <p>    Two ideals dominate the Tapazmali psyche: belief in a well-ordered,
hierarchical society and a sense of aesthetics. Combined, these ideals give a
remarkably accurate picture of the Tapazmali people and clearly set them apart
from their fellow humans.
  <p>    In a sense, the ideal of order and hierarchies stems from their
aesthetics. The Tapazmal see the Universe as intelligible and, therefore,
ordered by eternal laws. Individual Tapazmal differ as to the source and
nature of these eternal laws, but none doubt their existence. These eternal
laws have an order of primacy, from the most important to various lesser
degrees of importance.
  <p>    They see society as a whole to reflect that order. The more important
individuals should fittingly rule over the less important. That is, those
Tapazmali whose role in society is greater should have power over the others
commensurate with that responsibility.
  <p>    The Tapazmali governmental structure has always tended toward the
feudal. In earlier times, the more important people were who could find large
quantities of food in the inhabited mountainous regions. Although gathering
p'hazul berries did provide food, it did not provide enough for whole
communities. A hunter class developed to procure the meat of several mountain-
dwelling creatures. The leaders of these hunters came to represent life itself
to the Tapazmali , for without the meat they could not survive. The chief
hunter came to be the ruler and other hunters formed the nucleus of a noble
class.
  <p>    Each individual in Tapazmali society has a task. He or she must perform
that task in accordance with his or her abilities, but that task must be
performed. In earlier times, the failure by any member of society might have
led to disaster. Thus, each Tapazmali is acutely aware of his or her place in
society and does what society requires of them. To do otherwise would not be
dutiful and contrary to the Tapazmal way.
  <p>    Secondly, the Tapazmali have raised aesthetics to a very lofty level.
They see beauty everywhere. That beauty has its origins in the order and
intelligibly of the universe. Consequently, by creating works of beauty, the
Tapazmali are imitating the order and harmony of the whole universe. They are
attempting to share in the structure of the cosmos.
  <p>    Art in all its forms is revered among the Tapazmali. The senses, through
which one apprehends beauty, are greatly revered. Unlike other cultures and
philosophies, the Tapazmali do not denigrate sense perception or the physical
aspects of the universe. In anything, they revel in them. The beauty of a
physical object of any sort reflects the insubstantial but nevertheless real
beauty of the orderly universe.
 <p>     Tapazmali have developed great art forms for all of the five human
senses. There are even art works whose beauty goes beyond the purely physical
and these works reveal their beauty to the human mind.
  <p>    The Tapazmal are quite different in their psychology from other humans.
Some call their aesthetic and cosmological views overly mystical and esoteric,
but none deny their expertise in all art forms. Furthermore, their
submissiveness to the proper role of certain individuals has surprised many.
Solomani concepts of individual liberty and self-determination mean little to
them. For this reason, Dulinor's actions against Strephon are seen as being
utterly evil. As an archduke, a subordinate of the emperor, Dulinor should
have done what was expected of him. What he did do is seen as a serious breach
of the social contract and thoroughly without value.

<h3>Society and Culture</h3>
<p>
  <p>    Much of what defines Tapazmali society and culture has been discussed
above. This section discusses more specific information.
  <p>    The two art forms which the Tapazmali have developed to the highest
degree (and are most sought after) are those of cooking and architecture. Both
of these arts concern themselves with the necessities of life, even more
precarious among the Tapazmali because of where they lived.
  <p>    Cooking is a fine art among these humans. Since food was scarce and they
ate only two meals a day, Tapazmali developed ways to make the meals extra
special. Various and sundry spices and seasonings as well as special cooking
techniques make Tapazmali cuisine unforgettable. Since being given jump drive,
the Tapazmali have used their interstellar contacts to obtain even rarer
spices and herbs, as well as altering the dishes of other species, thus
furthering their fame as cooks.
  <p>    Architecture among the Tapazmali is well-suited to the mountain peaks
and crags where the original Tapazmali lived. Structures tend to be squat and
sturdy, like the Tapazmali themselves. This sturdy but beautiful building
structure also reveals their beliefs about the order and stability of the
universe. With the advent of space travel, the Tapazmali have begun to use
other architectural methods other than the traditional ones, and have also
added some new styles to their repertoire. All of these, no matter what their
origin, still reflect the Tapazmali mindset and cosmology. Both beauty and
order/stability are seen as the highest ideals, and ones which naturally flow
from each other.
  <p>    Tapazmali culture has a remarkable ability to adapt. New methods are
being used, provide the Tapazmali see these new methods keep within their
established patterns of thoughts. They are justifiably proud of their own
ancient traditions, but the universe has so much diversity and so much beauty
that it would be seen as somehow sacrilegious not to take advantage of that
diversity. If space travel has affected Tapazmali culture, it has had the
effect of undergirding its basic belief in the order and beauty inherent in
all things.
