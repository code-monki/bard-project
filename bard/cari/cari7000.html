<HR>

I've been working on an idea (based upon some of the
other material published on HIWG's Yiklerdranzh
webpage, and some revelations in GTs Alien Guide 1)
that deals with the real reason for what Regency media
and experts are terming the "Zhodani Collapse."
<P>
And its not the Empress Wave, though that was one of
the triggers for the current anarchy and chaos that
reign within the core sectors of the Consulate.
<P>
The real cause is the timeless bane of any large
empire: internal pressures and imperial decrepitude.
<P>
The real problems of the Zhodani Consulate are
outgrowths of their prevailing political culture,
especially the inability to maneuver within the narrow
confines of their social contract.
<P>
<h3>The Imperial Mindset about the Zhodani</h3>
<P>
The former Imperiums view of the Zhodani Consulate was
never rational or coherent, but rather hysterical and
ill-informed.  Even with the current blather about
"emotional sovereignty" put aside, Imperials often
treated the universe in a spectacularly ignorant and
self-interested way, and the Zhodani weren't spared
this narrow-mindedness. It is especially telling that
until the Regency era, there existed no declassified
studies or comprehensive reports on the Consulate
available for public consumption.
<P>
Certain misconceptions informed only by fear and
prejudice against the Zhodani ran rampant.  The worst
was the misperception of the nature and purpose of
psionics in their society, and the degree that it
anchored their social contract and political system.
Imperials mistook the application of psionics within
Zhodani society, for being the end justification of
their system, when in fact it was only the means.
The real end of Zhodani power and government is
actually quite understandable and familiar to us: the
creation of an earnest, egalitarian socialism.
<P>
That something so obvious could be missed by trillions
of otherwise rational human beings simply goes to show
how disfunctional the Third Imperium became in the
centuries after the first couple of Frontier Wars. In
a fashion resembling the European empires of pre-World
War I Earth when confronted with the socialist
programs of revolutionaries.
<P>
In both cases an elite with little inkling about the
lives of their people, clinging to an anachronistic
system of privilege and power, overreacted to the
designs and legitimate grievances of common workers
and well meaning academia. And they became paranoid of
a socialistic dogma that in truth they did not grasp
or understand.
 <P>
The most reactionary of Imperial nobles, which
included a great deal of the bureaucracy and military,
looked upon the Zhodani system with an unease they
couldn't place.  How could the Zhodani proles be
happy? With people constantly intruding into their
minds? It can't be because the Joes are doing
something that they were missing!  It must be because
the Joes are in league with Satan!!!
<P>
(This is dead serious.  The last line is quoted from
an actual memo circulated around the Imperial Ministry
of War in the aftermath of the Third Frontier War. It
went on to claim they used their alliance with
darkness to obtain magical powers to mesmerize people
and threaten the Imperium. The author of this memo was
none other than the Duke of Fornast...)
<P>
The Psionic Suppressions would never have gotten out
of hand as they did had the reactionaries (the
majority of the nobility in fact) hadn't whipped up
anti-Zhodani sentiment, and destroyed whatever
credibility that psionics had within the Third
Imperium as a result. All of this vitriol happened at
a safe remove from the actual point of contact with
the Zhodani.  In fact the only people who had any real
inkling about the Zhos were the very people who stared
across the border at them with uneasy wariness.
<P>
While the Marchers hatred of the Zhodani was a
contributing factor to the tall pile of anti-Zho
paranoia, it was nevertheless based upon real
experience, and was not a bogey-strawman for the
growing tensions within the Imperial core. So when
confronted with their own contradictions, whether in
the antebellum period, or most gravely during the
Rebellion and post-Collapse period, there was no
scapegoat for their troubles. A spade had to be called
a spade.
<P>
<h3>The Zhodani Way</h3>
<P>
Essentially Zhodani social contract is based upon a
tradeoff between happiness/security and social control
by an all-powerful psionic elite.  In the wake of the
ancient Qiknavrats plague, the discredited nobility
filled the vacuum of authority, and secured the
loyalty of the directionless and scared lower classes
in that dark time.
<P>
The nobility offered a rather Faustian bargain to the
"proles" class: a rigid socialistic society where
their happiness was assured, in exchange for their
full conformance and social obedience.  Since it was
an improvement over the chaos of the Plague, the lower
classes quite willingly assented to the plan.
<P>
Contrary to Imperial propaganda then, the Zhodani
Proles knew then, and know now, what they were getting
from their nobility.  The proles lived in a rigid,
conformist society, but that was the price for
happiness and security.  And it was ostensibly
democratic, in that the proles had access to their
ruling classes, who listened and legitimately cared to
their needs in return.  The Zhodani Consulate was a
"happy police state."
<P>
And to provide an additional outlet for
dissatisfaction, the nobility tested the prole
community for psionic abilities, enabling the talented
few to rise in social standing to eventually become
nobles themselves.
<P>
The enemy of the state wasn't any group or people, but
rather the emotional states of resentment, alienation
and fear.  The Tavrchedl, a combination fire
department/public health service, were granted access
to the minds of the proles, and they reserved the
right to "reeducate" the lost members of the flock, to
set them straight on the path of truth again.
<P>
And remarkably, Zhodani society coexisted peacefully
this way for 8,000 years, with only a few bumps in the
road, to mar their perfection.
<P>
But Zhodani society has a dark side to it.  All things
cast a shadow, even seeming Utopias.  The Zhodani have
a few secrets of their own, and this is the foundation
for their current troubles.

<P>
<h3>Contagion</h3>
<P>
There are two negative aspects to Zhodani society that
loom large. And they both stem from the price that
they pay for the happy social contract that was
established for the perfect society.
<P>
The two effects of the Tavrchedl and the Zhodani Way
is to go against the natural order of human existence,
and to stifle creative thought and alternative
freedoms. The cost of this arrangement comes in
sclerotic rigidity, and societal "flammability."
<P>
Addressing fear and resentment is imperative to the
security of the Zhodani order.  If proles were left
unattended to their devices, those negative emotions
could become resistance against either the political
order, or sociopathic behavior against society in
general.
<P>
To eliminate resentment is impossible and against the
natural order. Instead the proles were to be
"medicated" with the aid of the Tavrchedl and
reeducation, and the spread of resentment was to be
prevented. But to prevent the spread of resentment
means ultimately an attack upon language, symbols and
the articles of reason and speculative thought. Not
that the Zhodani have anything against reason and
thought; but they did not want it within the public
sphere, outside of institutional boundaries where it
could be controlled.
<P>
The Tavchedl were like firefighters or public health
doctors in that they were to prevent the contagion of
rampant resentment. But like wilderness firefighters
who aggressively attack every little blaze, or doctors
who overuse antibiotics in eliminating disease, their
charges become more vulnerable to the recurrence of
fire or illness, often in a catastrophic manner.
<P>
And the medicating of individual alienation missed an
even bigger part of human existence: the normal angst
and unhappiness of everyday life.  So even if the
Tavrchedl eliminated the blazes of conscious desire,
they could not eliminate the causes of human
dissatisfaction.  In other words the fuel for human
anguish and anger would simply build up, like a
hundred years of old-growth, or atrophied immune
systems.
<P>
This is the flammability, and it explains the intense
paranoia of Tavrchedl operations, and the fear of
"outside contamination." Fortunately for the Zhodani,
only once did they lose control, with the Meichntid
Ibl, and that was safely contained.
<P>
This overzealousness reveals the rigidity.  The
remarkable arraying of forces against human
dissatisfaction not only undermines reason, it creates
a rigid "co-dependent" social order, a perpetual
machine as it were, where the "sheep" of the masses
are placed in a perpetual state of vulnerability, and
the protectors exist in a state of permanent
vigilance.
<P>
This is a dictatorship, albeit a supposedly benevolent
one.  The means by which the nobility secure the
control of the masses is through the promise of
benevolence rather than the use of coercive force. But
this is no different from the co-dependent partner who
is granted dominance and mastery on the basis of the
love rather than force.  Protectors need
something to protect, whether it be society, or old
growth forests.
<P>
While Zhodani society is certainly better than the old
Imperium, it is less than ideal.  It is a fragile and
ultimately inflexible society that can only exist in a
vacuum of its own devising.  The Zhodani have been
lucky in their astrographic location and isolation.
Until the Empress Wave, of course.
<P>
<h3>Imperial Heat</h3>
<P>
If the Proles are the fuel in any potential inferno,
then it was the Imperium, and the Consulate
governments anti-imperial activities that provided the
accelerant for a potential fire.
<P>
The distrust of non-psionic minds among the nobility
extended most to the Third Imperium.  While it is
often declared that the TI was attacked by the
Consulate because of its "aggressiveness" and
unquenchable desire for conquest, one salient fact is
overlooked: in all five frontier wars, it was the
Zhodani who were the aggressors.  And it overlooks the
fact that after the Second Frontier War, the TI ceased
expanding its borders, and actually began to lose
territory as a result of over expansion.
<P>
It was Zhodani inability to understand Imperial
society that fueled their aggression. In this they
reflected growing Imperial prejudice, though that took
longer to develop than preexisting Zhodani attitudes.
If Zhodani society was a vague threat to the Imperial
nobility, then the seeming stability of the Imperium
was a definite threat to the Zhodani social order.
<P>
The Consulate government made a number of half-hearted
attempts to "reform" or modify the Imperium into the
image of pleasantness, but they only managed to
inflame their neighbor, through their military attacks
and their dunderheaded and illegal support of Imperial
Psionic Institutes.  For a society that prided itself
on its psionic abilities, this inability to clearly
see and understand the Imperium casts aspersions on
its leaders and institutions.
<P>
But the fear of the Imperium created a fault line, a
condition for burning as it were.  Zhodani social
philosophy is utterly blank, some value X where
everyone simply accepts the social order of things as
they are without question or concern.  But Consulate
operations against the Imperium required the
development of an ideology "X plus some value Y and
Z", to distinguish and justify their actions.  Unlike
the internal enemies of human emotion, the Imperium
was a real target, and could therefore had to be
treated with objective means.
<P>
But the question of what to do to the Imperium created
controversy, and eventually factions within the
greater communal consensus of the nobility and its
institutions, and divided them into pro- and
anti-imperial factions of increasingly hardline
persuasions.  This was significant in that the normal
harmonious inertia of Zho society was being distressed
by an argument whose premises exceeded, and at times
overrode, its self-interested workings.
<P>
But Consulate military and intelligence operations
also entailed the risk of contamination from captive
Imperial sources, or through inadvertent contact by
Zhodani POWs with Imperial society.  And it was the
Zhodani military triumph in the Third Frontier War
that brought the lethal virus into Zhodani society.
<P><h3>Cascade</h3><P>
Underlying the Zhodani "Troubles" is the convergence
of unrelated phenomenon at the same point in such a
manner that it fractured Zhodani Society. Usually
these phenomenon are insufficient to wreak the kind of
havoc that the Consulate is enjoying, but in
conjunction they have created what sociologists would
call a "cascade."
<P>
What and epidemic is to disease, and an inferno is to
fire, a cascade is to the popular assimilation of
ideas.  The circumstances for a cascade to occur are
rather simple: either through peer modelling, and
observation of fellow societal members, or through
acceptance of an idea's inherent usefulness.
<P>
Either way the status quo of Zhodani society has been
rejected in some fundamental way by the Zhodani people
themselves.  And as a result their society has
fractured along previously hidden fault lines, and
into open warfare between regional, economic and
cultural groupings.
<P>
The how and why are more easily understandable.
Zhodani society had been a vacuum, a carefully
insulated inner state based upon mutual dependence.
That state had no other compelling argument in its
defense, and it was too specialized and narrow survive
wider contact with the real world outside.  The bottom
line is that there was no system of JUDGEMENT, of
dealing with the real world, for individual Zhodani.
Psionics made it easy to medicate individual problems,
without admitting their intractability. Eventually
everyone emphasized stasis over any real solutions, or
even admitting the existential dilemmas of ordinary
life.
<P>
The events that have shattered the Zhodani Consulate
are:
<P>
<li> The Empress Wave.
<li>Competition from outside ideas from Imperial and
Solomani sources. In particular, religious and
philosophical traditions.
<li>Growing factionalism among the nobility, and
increasing social deterioration and decrepitude.
<P>
Cascades only occur when the status quo is found to be
wanting. They either lead to short-lived fads, or they
can utterly transform a society in an eyeblink,
sometimes with devastating consequences.  And the
speed with which they occur varies with the degree of
information exchange.  That means that the breakdown
of Zhodani society isn't just confined among the
proles, but is being lead and perpetuated by elements
among the nobility, Tavrchedl and Consulate
bureaucracy, with the proles following in their
leaders examples.  The breakdown is originally
vertical in nature, from the top down, and then
spread horizontally within the prole population.
<P>
And as for the WHAT that shattered Zhodane?
<P>
The convergence of the three trends mentioned above:
Religion.
<P>
Psionics simply denied the problem without addressing
the real world, and the Zhodani were left with a
gnawing hunger for individual meaning, something their
nobility couldn't address.  But the breaking point was
when the nobility and intendants, too, began to tire
of their narrow existences, and yearn for meaning as
well. And that yearning is related to the Empress
Wave, the existence of competing Imperial religious
traditions.
<P>
<h3>Collapse</h3>
Zhodani Consulate could have been best thought of, at
the height of its power, as a giant dairy farm. Thanks
to psionics, the Zhodani nobility and Tavrchedl
managed to "domesticate" that most unruly of useful
animals, their fellow humanity.
<P>
This was done with the best of intentions, and it was
set up in a fairly ethical manner.  Domestication
transforms the otherwise ornery relationship between
two parties into a ridiculously simple paternalistic,
if not parasitic, relationship between a master and
their valuable property. That oversimplifies the
noble-prole relationship a bit, but it crystallises
what Zhodani society was before the "Zhodani
Collapse."
<P>
It was a happy relationship, but then humanity has a
bias for animal husbandry.  We tend characterise in a
self-serving manner our charges as loving, simple
creatures bereft of their survival instincts, happy
with their lot in life, utterly grateful to their
masters, and both harmless and totally dedicated to
their usefulness.  The proles recieved absolute
security and happiness, at the expense of their more
rugged human aspects, and utterly trusted the nobles.
<P>
But what Zhodane created was the societal equivalent
of an agricultural monoculture.  And the only reason
that it developed to the stage it did, was because of
the Consulate's remote location away from the other
major races. (Except the Vargr. But the Zhodani just
wrinkled their little noses, and shrugged their
shoulders at the mere mention of THEM.) The
elimination of rough human emotion and violent
tendencies had created a basically homogenous society
of boring, humdrum sameness.  Which was good for the
Proles: everyday life was as safe as sleeping in one's
own bed.  (Regency wags used to joke that the lives of
the Proles were so boring it made cricket seem
interesting by comparison.)
<P>
But like other livestock, the lives of the proles
depended upon the loyalty and diligence of their
masters.  Should the farmers discover something better
than their current lots in life, the farm will go to
seed, and the animals will starve, or be sold at their
master's wont.
<P>
The nobility, like good yeoman farmers of old, were
exhorted to hard work and good deeds, and for the most
part, for most of their history, the majority of them
were totally dedicated to their tasks.  But farming is
at best boring, painful drudgery.  And the lives of
the nobility were little different.  The desire for
something more to fill the nameless void they could
not name drove many of them to itinerant travel,
eccentricity and strong drink. The Imperium, Solomani
and other alien races confused them with their
differing cultures, and xenophobia and the need for
conformity prevented serious consideration of
differing perspectives or ideas.
<P>
Among the Solomani, with their vast panoply of
religious ideas and experiences, there is a phenomenon
they called the Jerusalem Syndrome.  It took its name
from those Christian pilgrims who travelled to the
Holy City, and were overwhelmed by sensations of
elation and euphoria. These pilgrims, being so close
to the reliquaries of their faith, came to feel as if
they were annihilated into the essence of God's will
and were now fully apart of divine providence, or were
the walking embodiment or rebirth of divine salvation
and will. Eventually the Solomani, and Imperial
psychologists, extended the term to all religious
devotees who demonstrated this kind of conversion
experience.
<P>
Had the Zhodani simply exchanged notes, or had taken
the time to understand their human cousins, tragedy
might have been averted.  But the Zhodani were
repulsed, as many ancient Solomani once were, by the
darkness they percieved within the wilderness around
them. And like those ancient Solomani who came in
contact with indigenous peoples living with wild
nature, came to look down upon these peoples as
savages unworthy of study or contact.
<P>
(Author's note: There are two things to glean from the
preceding paragraph. First the Zhodani were no less
racist than any other major race. Second, they were
dominated by a dualistic philosophy that divided the
world into psionic/Zhodani heaven and non-psionic
hell. The last part is especially interesting because
the Zhodani were not so much biased towards psionics,
as towards a society that modelled itself on theirs.
If they encountered a society where psionics were not
being used in a manner to their standards, they were
as contemptous towards it as to any other non-psionic
society. And that explains their muted hostility
towards the Thirz Empire.
<P>
In the end the Zhodani, despite their Fahrenheit 441
inspired culture, were no different from those
snobbish Victorian Era aristocrats that clung to the
old agrarian order they were accustomed to, and
championed it against the egalitarian and democratic
agitation of city-dwellers and workers.)
<P>
The Zhodani encountered the Empress Wave either on
their Third or Fourth Core Expedition.  It is
speculated that the reason for the core missions, and
the Ancient relic that inspired it, are somehow
related to the phenomenon behind the Empress Wave. We
may never know for sure.  But the Zhodani knew about
the Wave a full 2500 years before Longbow detected it.
 And the they found it to be a painful nuisance.
Whatever followed the first part of the Empress Wave
is apparently more powerful in psionic intensity, and
psions that experienced it suffered elation, hilarity
and euphoria, and even profound visions or psionic
"echos".  These are commensurate with side effects
from the Ancient core projector, and with the symptoms
of Jerusalem Syndrome.
<P>
Since the Zhodani preferred to keep religion out of
their society, since it complicated the
one-dimensional lines between proles and nobles,
Zhodani psions who encountered the Wave before it even
reached the Consulate had no means of expressing their
experiences or venting their emotional reactions.  Had
they been able to, the rationalisation of religion, or
perhaps better psychology, would have calmed them
down. But instead it was further complicated by the
Consulate governments adversion to these encounters,
requiring reeducation of those affected.  Zhodani
reeducation, however, tends to short-circuit adverse
emotions before they can be articulated, and this
intensified the agitation of "Waveriders".  And the
strength of the wave was such that Zhodani therapists
were unable to replace the engram with their own.  The
result was frequently madness, sociopathic violence
and suicide.
<P>
So powerful were the suggestions and visions that for
at frequent intervals nobles and intendants caught
within its path embarked upon violent crusades against
their motherland, often out desperation, somtimes out
of revenge against ham-handed reeducating.  These lone
sociopaths were responsible for the trickle of battles
that Longbow observed.  The Consulate government
decided in the end to create a moving Quarantine,
either psi-shielding affected psions, or by attempting
to "leapfrog" psions by jumping them past the
wavefront, and finally just declaring affected areas
off-limits until the phenomena cleared up, and
Tavrchedl units could clean up.  As long as the
nobility remained as a unit, the problem would
eventually dissapate.
<P>
But the nobility, as mentioned before, were an
eccentric and dilletantish bunch.  And a number of
them had become knowledgable, either through travel,
or through military service against the Third Imperium
and its allies, of the basics of religious belief and
formation.  It was from these sources that the Word
would come, and a number of the Farmers would leave
their plows, tether their livestock to chariots and
artillery and raise the flag of insurrection.
<P>
In the end the Third Imperium was done in by its
hubris.  But for the Zhodani Consulate, the end came
from its insistence upon perfectionism and cartesian
didactism, which makes more for a comedy than a
tragedy.
<P>

When some Regency wags finally heard how the EW was
tearing apart the Consulates bucolic society, they
took to calling it "Mad Cow Disease."  It is worth
noting that Regency wit is beginning to resemble the
old Imperial Cores in its air of self-adulatory
contemptousness.<P>
