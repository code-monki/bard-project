	The Jannix are a race of insectoid creatures somewhat similar
in appearance to the Terran Rhinoceros Beetle.  They average 2.5
meters in height and 1.5 in width.  They have four major limbs, two
small connector appendages in the upper third of the body and a pair
of large cutting horns out the top of the shell.  Normal locomotion
is accomplished on all fours although they are capable of standing on
either set of limbs for extended periods.  A dense carapace covers
the back and sides of the Jannix and the front is also protected,
although to a lesser degree, by a chitin exoskeleton. The Jannix are
colored from flat black to dark blue and deep purple, this seems to
be influenced by the ambient temperature of the environment.
<p>
	The smaller connector appendages are usually attached to an
organic weapon which fires chitin shells filled with acid/bile.
These shells appear to be the Jannixs waste material and are highly
toxic to humanoids.  Sometimes the Jannix are seen with other organic
devices in place of these weapons, including computer interfaces and
medical/repair devices, but these are very rare and the Jannix seem
to go to great lengths to protect these.  There have been reports of
flying Jannix, but it is more likely the creature's capability of
jumping up to 30 meters high and 50 meters forward with the carapace
spread out.<p>

	The social structure of the Jannix is relatively unknown.
Whenever they have been encountered in the wilds, there has been a
vampire ship nearby.  It is believed somehow there exists a working
relationship between the two.  This could be a dire threat to the
Regency, but so far there have been no known incursions into our
space.  The Jannix are unrelenting in the pursuit of their goals,
whatever they may be.  A live specimen has never been taken for
study.  Scientific perusal of dead ones has yielded some facts
however.  Their blood is very acidic, to the point of damaging most
container vessels.  They are capable of ingesting minerals but prefer
organic materials.  They have internal organs capable of producing
chemical physiological enhancers that can give them great strength
and endurance for a short period.  They also have the ability to
reproduce items of technology, converting the items inside the body
and then expelling them.  This appears to be limited to small and
uncomplex items, less than .2 cubic meters in volume and 5 kg in
weight.  It is not understood how their other equipment such as ships
or vehicles are manufactured as they have no fine manipulative
ability.<p>

	Some of the technology recovered from them indicates an
advance level, perhaps as high as 17 in some instances.  Zhodani
scientists believe that they must work with or have subjugated
another race capable of these tasks.  The Zhodani have encountered
the Jannix on a number of occasions, leading them to much greater
knowledge of these creatures.  This is also where we get the term
Jannix Cooperative.  However, with no contact policy in effect, it
is difficult to make any other assumptions or conclusions at this
time.<p>

<hr>
<h3>History</h3>


The Jannix Cooperative occupies an area of space on the trailing edge of
Zhodani territory.  These two races have fought a number of small
skirmishes, which is where most of this data comes from.  The Jannix were
first encountered in the year 1106 when a Zhodani scout cruiser, the
<i>Zephone</i>, was found dead in orbit around the moon of the planer Destrier in
the Qwan subsector.  After being boarded, it was found the crew had been
slaughtered to a man by an as yet unidentified group of insectoid
creatures.  Four dead specimens were found on board the <ki>Zephone</i>.  After
careful study (the results of which are published elsewhere), it was
determined that a new threat had presented itself to the Zhodani people.  A
modest fleet was dispatched to the subsector and ordered to track these
creatures' movements or where they had come from.<p>

Fleet 27 arrived at Destrier early in 1107 and spent several months
searching with no results other than discovering two traders that had been
reported missing in Qwan months ago.  They both showed signs of damage by
alien weapons and in one case a small piece of hull was found from an
unknown ship amid the wreckage of a trader.  This hull metal was tested and
found to be above bonded superdense technology.<p>

On the way back to Sector HQ for refit, Fleet 27 was attacked at a gas
giant refueling station.  The ambush had obviously been set for a while as
the enemy ships came out of the asteroid ring where they had lain dormant
undetected by the stations automated sensors.  The fight was brief as
superior weapons and faster ships overwhelmed Fleet 27.  They did manage to
destroy a 5000 ton destroyer class ship and cripple three 800 ton hulls,
one of which headed into the gas giant while the other two smashed into the
refueling station.  Two Zhodani escorts were able to jump away, but the
other 6 ships were lost with all hands.  After examining the battle report,
the Zhodani sent a large attack armada into the system to resolve the
situation once and for all.  Upon exiting jump, they found the entire base
ravaged to bare rock and very little debris to indicate anything had ever
been there.  They headed trailward intending to track the aliens down.
After several jumps with no further evidence encountered, they came to a
system unexplored for 16 years.  They discovered a base in orbit around the
4th planet with several ships close by.  Proceeding on attack vector, the
Zhodani engaged and managed to defeat the base and ships with heavy
casualties to themselves.  A horrific fight ensued after the Zhodani
admiral ordered his marines to take the planetary base located close to a
mountain range.  The marines fought hand to pincher in close quarter's
combat with the insectoids as most of the base turned out to be
underground.  Over 1500 troops died in the action, but they took the
facility.  Several aliens were captured alive only due to incapacitating
wounds, in all other cases the aliens fought to the death.  Among those
captured was one different from the rest, this one was capable of psionic
activity.  The best Psions the Zhodani had were employed to wrench
information from the creature's mind.<p>

The Psions found out much about the Jannix, as the creatures called
themselves, before it succumbed to the telepathic onslaught.  The Jannix
had originally come from a system some 30 parsecs further trailing, a total
of 5 subsectors away from the Zhodani border.  This base the Zhodani found
had been established as a frontier colony/raiding post.  Almost the entire
strength of the Jannix in the area had been destroyed in the two actions to
date.  The Psions learned of at least two other colonies to spinward.  The
Jannix cooperate with another race known only as the Builders.  This race
did not accompany the Jannix on their forward deployments.  It was learned
there are three classes of Jannix, Warriors, Technicians and Leaders. They
all have differing abilities, but all are extremely deadly creatures (see
technical notes).  The Builders outfit the Jannix with all their equipment
but the inherent bioweapons.  The Builders technology level appears to be
17 with some minor discrepancies.  The Jannix themselves are TL 4, but they
are capable of using most technological devices, just not building them.
This is probably due to their lack of fine manual dexterity.  The Jannix
also appear to subjugate other races (less intelligent) to do most manual
labor tasks.  Many Gordas (a race of semi intelligent herbivore primates)
were found at the Jannix base, although these were killed in the fighting.
The Zhodani became rapidly convinced they had to make preemptive strikes on
these other bases, as the Jannix/Builders alliance was far too dangerous to
remain unchecked.  The main problem the Zhodani had in coming to grips with
the Jannix was the technology gap.  The Jannix ships required no jump fuel,
apparently using psi-drive technology, so could leave anytime.  Also the
ships had a significant advantage in electronic countermeasure ability.
However, the Zhodani's quantitative edge along with their much larger ships
were able to eradicate the Jannix's other two bases and many starships.
The Zhodani also reported at least three ships they caught on the ground
but were unable to do anything about as they were protected by some sort of
force field impervious to weapon fire.  These locations are not known to
any but the Zhodani military.<p>

For the next four decades the Zhodani had no further problems or encounters
with Jannix until the evacuation to the new Regency began.  The evacuation
pulled the Zhodani protected border in by many parsecs.  As of the current
date (1202), there have been a few scattered reports of Jannix encounters
in that area.  The Zhodani, affected as they are by Vampire problems, have
been unable to do much about these new incursions.  The most distressing
news is that the Jannix appear to be working with Vampire ships in some
instances.  To this date, no specimens of the Builder race have been
encountered although there have been reports of new mechanized fighting
machines acting with or around Jannix/Vampire activity.  These machines
generally have a humanoid form and a Vampire attitude.  It is believed that
this threat left unchecked could rival that of the virus release.  The
Zhodani offer large grants for information leading to destruction or
capture of Jannix/Builder technology, any information regarding whereabouts
or scientific data is also rewarded.<p>

The Jannix are known to prefer underground installations and cooler
temperatures, their exoskeleton changes color from black to blues the
warmer it gets, although it appears to have no effect on their activities.
They have been known to survive in vacuum for short periods of time.  This
is due to a lack of respiration, their bodily functions are almost all
organic chemicals, they do not require air to "breath" although they do
require oxygen for some functions.  The Jannix are the most deadly
intelligent race known at this time from a purely physical standpoint.
<p>
They seem to have no concept of surrender or truce and show no desire to
communicate with other species with the exception of their subjugate races.
 The leader types are capable of psionic communication and other psionic
abilities.  Their overall racial strategy has eluded Zhodani scientists, as
there is no evidence of a cohesive attempt to gain large chunks of
territory.  The Jannix raid into systems at random but make no effort to
retain what they take.  It is believed they are searching for something of
use to them or the Builders.  There has been evidence of burrowing/mining
at the few sites on planets where Jannix have been encountered, but this is
believed to be for breeding chambers.  There have also been stockpiles of
several naturally occurring minerals and organic compounds found at these
sites.  None of which are particularly valuable in a monetary or military
sense.  It is believed that these are the substances the Jannix need for
breeding or other bodily functions.
<p>
The Jannix life cycle has been documented to some degree.  It is know that
they are asexual and produce egg sacs, which are stored in vats of
chemical, most of which are naturally occurring substances.  The gestation
period is unknown as all eggs that were captured failed to mature.  There
was one encounter that included an immature form of Jannix, which was much
weaker than an adult but was still capable of combat.  It is believed the
Jannix mature very quickly and most of their skills are telepathic implants
rather than learned individual experience.  It is assumed that the class of
a given Jannix is determined by a combination of its egg development and
it's telepathic implants.  It is unknown whether a leaders psionic ability
is inherited or random chance.  The oldest Jannix body recovered was 8
standard years old.  The Jannix are capable of "growing" a part of their
body from the two manipulator arms.  The typical parts, which are all
organic based; are their weapons, tools, and computer interface devices.
There have been reports of other strange things, but it is very rare and
probably misinterpreted.
<p>
The Jannix have several classes of starships.  There have been encounters
with 400, 800, 1200 and 5000 ton vessels.  They are known to use at least
two small craft, a 50 and a 100-ton, both of these are believed to be jump
capable as well.  An APC type vehicle and an AFV tank have been seen, but
both of these were land vehicles.  This is one apparent discrepancy to the
Builder technology level, contra-grav has not been seen in use on anything
smaller than 50 tons.  Another is that small arms and support weapons are
all organic based.  Starships are the only ones that have "normal"
weaponry.  They also seem to have a limited self-repair capability as well
as AI or self-aware computers.  Captured equipment has defied most attempts
to use or interface with it.  The only successes have been by the strongest
telepaths.

Soldiers have the ability to increase their Str and Con stats by 5 for 10
combat turns twice a day.  This boost comes from chemicals produced in an
internal organ.  They go dormant for 2 combat turns when it wears off
unless the second boost is used.  Soldiers may leap up to 30 meters high
and 50 meters forward instead of their normal move using their carapace
wings to assist once every 10 combat turns.  This requires and Average
Agility task.  Soldiers carry a Jannix Rifle at all times.  They are also
capable of emitting a tear gas/ smoke cloud with a 10 meter radius once a
day.<p>
