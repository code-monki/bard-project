<H3>History</H3>

The Forlorn are a minor human race of unknown origin.  Commonly called
Gypsies, a term they dislike, the Forlorn (the Galanglic translation of
their word to describe themselves) are the only known zero-gee adapted
humans. <P>

The Forlorn, as near as can be told, seem to have originated somewhere in
the area of space trailing the Imperium (Milieu 0), possibly somewhere in
the Fornast sector, possibly more distant than that. Their planetary
culture apparently reached about TL 8 before some great calamity occurred
on their homeworld. The Forlorn themselves have only fragmentary knowledge
of that time, and no remaining records; much of their history has been
passed down in an oral tradition, this time is known only to them as 'The
Destruction'. <P>

Apparently they had some warning of the calamity, because they undertook a
desperate task: to save as much of their people, culture and history as
possible. <P>

A monstrous building effort took place on their home world, which
according to their oral tradition sapped all of it's resources. <P>

Hundreds of large sub-light ships were built, several millions of people
were placed on board for a journey that was supposed to only last,
perhaps, ten years, to nearby systems that their scientists thought
contained planets that would sustain them. <P>

At this point what happened is unclear. Tradition holds that whatever the
calamity was, reached out and overtook their ships, as well, before they
were completely out of the system. Apparently great damage was done to all
of the ships, many were utterly destroyed, most lost some functions. The
great fleet was scattered, as well. <P>

Through truly heroic effort, some twenty seven of the ships were brought
back together. All were damaged, many had hundreds of dead and wounded,
with failing life support systems, failing power generation, failing
control systems. <P>

Fortunately the people in the 27 had access to a large supply of material
and machinery destined for use on the now-unreachable target systems. By
cannibalizing their future, they managed to bind the 27 into a loose
association of structures, linked by tenuous threads, but linked
nonetheless. <P>

After 1500 years, they had traveled unimaginable distances, and had come
to know themselves as the Forlorn, the lost ones, as they passed star
after star, never having the delta vee their feeble propulsion system
could muster to stop at the ones their instruments indicated had habitable
planets, never finding one they could stop at that had anything but baked
vacuum rocks and vast, cold gas giants. <P>

As the centuries passed they became accustomed to their low gee world,
becoming masters at recycling, refashioning ships again and again,
stealing matter from the cold empty space, atom by atom, with huge
magnetic nets, that fueled their power systems, ran their lights, kept
their precious plants alive, kept them alive. <P>

They changed, physically, as well. Their ancestors had all been chosen for
their suitability of working in space, and the harsh first 500 years
ruthlessly weeded out all but the fittest. They slowly became slender,
lithe, conservative of air, and movement. The 27 could only manage 0.25
gravities in the parts that were able to spin for weight. Most of the
living spaces were permanently weightless. <P>

The web that bound the 27 became the culture that bound the Forlorn.
Cooperation was essential in all things, and each individual had a grave
responsibility to all, if they were to survive. Yet grim surroundings did
not mean grim people. They had access to a number of plant dyes to color
their world, and once the dreadful first few centuries passed, and they
learned to manage their world better, they were able to expand, have
families, start to live again. They had to, else succumb to the gnawing
despair that had robbed so many in the early years of their will to live. <P>

The 27 became a world of it's own, slowly growing, speeding through the
empty reaches of space toward their rendezvous with the Third Imperium. In
- -240, the first report of a rumored giant sub-light ship filtered through
the free trader network back to the Federation. By -180 it was clear the
ship was approaching, and it was steadily decelerating. It was headed
towards a system with a sparsely inhabited agricultural world in the
Geshaggere system. In -168, as they slowed to a wide looping orbit around
the primary, the Forlorn were astonished to find themselves met by other
humans in spacecraft. They were almost as astonished as the Scouts who met
them. <P>

Thus began the last upheaval in the lives of the Forlorn.<P>

After 1500 years of believing that they were the only humans in existence,
the shock of finally coming to rest, and finding, not only humans, but
humans who could travel faster than light, humans who had spread to
thousands of worlds, humans who were already living on the beautiful
planet that they had come to think of as their new home was more than many
could take. To many this was a time as dark as the original Destruction.
To many their struggle to live over the last 1500 years had been an
exercise in futility...they thought they were the salvation of humanity.
An epidemic of depression and suicide swept the Forlorn. <P>

Worse, when some of them ventured down to the planet, they found it was
not a place they found fit to live in, it was dirty, smelly, disease
ridden. They weighed too much, many were utterly paralyzed from the
weight, and most of them suffered from horrible agoraphobia. They were
used only to no horizon in the space between ships, or a ships hull, at
most, a hundred meters away; a horizon line many kilometers or hundreds of
kilometers away left them reeling with dizziness, nausea, and a feeling of
panic. <P>

Soon, the survivors realized that after all this time, they HAD a home,
and it was on their familiar, beloved 27.  They realized that now they no
longer had to depend on capturing material atom by atom, but they could
comb the system they were in for material. They could construct large new
habitats, fill them with their recycler farms, their beloved strinthee's,
and grow. Their depression turned to exhilaration, as they realized that
they, of all the people they'd met were the most suited to living in
space. They had technologies far in advance of the Imperium, in some
respects: in the areas of large scale life support systems, zero gee
construction, long distance sensors and analysis, manipulation of magnetic
fields, hydroponics farming they were at least TL 13-14. In this they at
least had something to offer the Federation. They were fortunate their
first contacts were with a honest scout from an honest large corporation.
Their secrets weren't stolen from them, and their interests were properly
represented during the chaotic first years of their recontact with
humankind. <P>

It is doubtful that they'd be as lucky in today's expansionist
environment. <P>

 <h3>Forlorn in the Imperium</h3>

The Forlorn have increased their numbers since arriving in the Imperium,
with a total population now somewhere around 5-8 million. There are
pockets of them throughout the old Sylean Confederation space. Forlorn
work teams are in high demand for zero gee construction, and Forlorn
designed life support systems are sold throughout the Imperium for use in
vacuum and hostile environment habitats. Forlorn researchers are found in
the IISS research branch, where they are working on long distance sensor
and survey techniques.<P>

Still, most Forlorn are still clustered in the Geshaggere system, living
and working in their growing cluster of habitats at Geshaggere's lagrange
points. They are acutely aware that they are, by now, quite different from
the people they have settled amidst, and feel considerably lost unless
they are with a number of other Forlorn. Their history of intense
community cooperation have made them even more group oriented than the
Vilani, though without the technological conservatism that marks Vilani
culture. They have a distinct language, that they work assiduously to keep
alive, as they do their rich oral history and traditions. <P>

They have a love of brightly colored clothing and surroundings, of music,
of food.  They have embraced a number of foods from their new
surroundings, blending them into their cuisine as the plants have proven
to be compatible with their farming systems. <P>

Outside of the Geshaggere system, they are most often found in family
groups of 15-45 individuals, never solitary. They have been the target of
more than a little discrimination, for their habits of travelling in
groups, their strange language, their habitual use of filter masks in the
presence of outsiders, and more often, their disdain for those they
consider 'Drangin', 'dirt-bugs', their derogatory term for anyone who
isn't happier living at zero-g in a nice clean space habitat. In other
words, anyone who lives on a planet.  Most Forlorn feel they are truly the
only modern humans, living free from their planetary bonds. All of endless
space is their homeland. <P>

<h3>Forlorn Innovations</h3>

Life support systems. Forlorn life support systems are really designed for
use in large habitats, or very large ships; they are unsuitable for use in
small ships. They are a combination recycling system/farm, using a
combination of plants, algae, and some rather exotic polymer and
metallopolymer membrane systems to maintain a healthy atmosphere, food,
and water supply over long, practically infinite periods of time. These
systems are much more efficient than current Imperial life support
systems, but need more attention and are at times quite susceptible to
'poisoning' by outside contaminants, such as heavy metals, bacteria and
fungi. They work best when a 'clean' system can be erected, such as on a
vacuum world, or in orbit, where some decontamination can be set up for
incoming personnel. <P>

They have smaller systems for use on board small ships, which are more
like small hydroponic gardens more than anything else. These cannot
replace full life support systems, but rather, provide an extra amount of
'conditioning' to the system, particularly the air supply, removing trace
irritants, and adding the impossible-to- replicate scents of living
plants. Ships that carry such systems do not receive any cut in costs for
life support, but can realize an increased 5-10% on middle and high
passage fare, because the systems simply make it more pleasant to be on
board. <P>

PC's could well want to invest in one of these systems, not only for the
increased revenue, but again, because it's a lot more pleasant to be on a
ship with one. <P>

Forlorn 'Life Conditioning Unit': Displaces 2 dT/100 dT of ship to be
'conditioned', requires minimal power, and requires 0.1 Crew member/ dT
for maintenance and operation, counted as Steward. <P>

Magnetic Field <anipulation : The Forlorn's only resupply system during their centuries in flight were
their laboriously adapted magnetic radiation and particle shields (Their
original ships were to carry the fuel they needed). They became adept at
manipulating magnetic fields within the low power constraints of their
systems, filtering the scant detrius of interstellar space for hydrogen,
carbon monoxide, methane, and rarer molecules. They have a large practical
knowledge of this subject, but since most of their experience is a
significant fractions of c, the practicality and usability of their
technology is questionable in the much lower speed Imperium. Still they
have struggled to make some headway. <P>

MagSieve Magnetic 'sieve' for recovering low concentrations of material
from plasma, gaseous, or other extremely low density media. Basically a
variation of the Bussard Ramjet; this is a system that can collect
specifically sized molecules or atoms from some medium. Currently used
experimentally for recovering trace resources from cometary belts, the
upper reaches of Gas Giants, proto star systems, or similar environments.
This is currently experimental technology, and is still somewhat of a
'solution without a problem'. The advantage of this system is that it
could be converted to a rugged, automated system. Resource concentrations
may be low in Cometary belts, or particularly proto-star systems, but a
simple device that can operate for months or years without service could
collect a huge amount of material. Forlorn control of magnetic fields,
however is still pretty much confined to low power applications. <P>

Zero Gee construction:

Forlorn structures are marvels of maximum strength with minimum mass, and
their abilities to work on and manipulate structures in zero gee are
almost inborn by now. They have developed a number of specialized
composites and alloys for such use. Their structures are often designed to
withstand stresses in very defined directions, and Forlorn designs often
resemble elaborate spiderwebs of tension elements, often looking no more
substantial than balsa wood models. <P>

Forlorn structures are typically built in place as they cannot withstand
the forces required to boost them into position. However, they are often
far more economical of construction time, material and volume than
'normally' designed orbital hab's or structures, and have found a niche
for use as astronomical observatories, deep space sensor platforms or comm
relays, or belter habitats. <P>

Some of their engineering elements and composites are finding their way
into Imperial engineering practice, as well, and there is a noted Forlorn
occupying the Branfield chair at the Sylea Institute of Technology. Well,
she doesn't actually occupy the chair, but rather an orbital habitat near
Sylean Highport, which serves as a classroom/summer camp/laboratory for
students in her program of Alternative Construction Methods. She simply
telecommutes for all her ordinary departmental duties. <P>

<h3>Library Data</h3>

Groukit: This is one of the few plants the Forlorn were able to retain
from the Destruction. In it's most primitive, base form, it is a low, fast
growing, squashlike vegetable. It was originally intended to be a food
source and 'air conditioner' plant, since it has large leaves for
relatively high rates of respiration. It has been manipulated into a large
number of variants providing everything from dyes to food to fibers for
cloth. Even now, after an influx of new plants, the Groukit has an
important place in Forlorn agriculture, and even more, an important place
in the Forlorn heart. Every household has a large, lavishly cared for
Groukit in a place of honor in their main room. <P>

Strinthee: This is the only animal from their home world that the Forlorn
have left. All the other species they were taking with them were lost with
the rest of the Fleet. The strinthee is a small omnivorous quadruped,
massing 1-4 kilos, which occupied the same niche on their home world as
the modern house cat, as a pet and predator on small pests. Long
considered lucky on ships, both surface and spacegoing, there were
numerous strinthees on all of the ships of the Fleet. Strinthee's are well
adapted for zero-gee life as well, since the evolved from small arboreal
omnivores. They do not have prehensile taile or opposable thumbs, but are
otherwise quite dextrous. Strinthee's are as much a part of a family as
the any other Forlorn, and though they are quite inquisitive at times,
they will tend to stay within sight or scent distance of their family. <P>

Forlorn societal structure: The Forlorn, more than any other society in
the Imperium value the group, over the individual. Decisions, major, and
minor are often made by consensus. While this can slow negotiations with
non-Forlorn, this means that agreements are well thought out.
Paradoxically, though, the Forlorn value innovative thinking by
individuals as well, since many times throughout their history, it was
only the quick actions and ideas of individuals that saved them. Forlorn
schooling focuses a great deal on rapid, iterative problem solving: " Fix
it NOW, then fix it better, until it's done right" rather than "study it
to death, then fix it right"...far too often in their history what would
have been dead would have been them. The Forlorn, in other words, are
inveterate tinkerers. <P>

Since the entire 27 came to become, essentially, an extended village, the
Forlorn concept of 'group' includes all the Forlorn in existence. They do
recognize more immediate familial groups, and Forlorn living arrangements
are usually oriented around this size group, which will usually consist of
a biologically related extended family.  Forlorn are very gregarious,
though, and larger communities tend to still act in a very unified
fashion. The initial screening of their remote descendants, and the
intervening 1500 years of isolation, with the vastly smaller initial
population of the 27, means that the Forlorn, while considerably more
genetically homogenous than the Imperial norm, are relatively free of
genetic diseases. <P>

They are, in general, more susceptible to diseases and infections than the
Imperial norm. This accounts for their habitually wearing filter masks and
full cover outer garments in areas where they have wide contact with
outsiders and their pathogens, particularly in their rare ventures onto a
planet. Physically they are taller, much thinner, and often weaker than
the Imperial norm, although this is mostly the effects of life led at low
or zero-gee;  there are some Forlorn who are adapted to higher gee
environments. Most have long, nimble toes, as well, and some can use them
almost as facilely as hands. Zero-gee has other advantages as well. Most
Forlorn are quite long lived, due to the lessened strain of gravity on
their bodies, as well as the low calorie diet they maintain.<P>

There has been some mixing of the Forlorn and Imperial humans, but their
greater susceptibility to disease and cultural differences have combined
to keep the Forlorn a fairly insular group, and 'adopted' Imperials are a
small minority. <P>

At home, Forlorn have a wide variety of dress, often in wild colors. Their
love of color and visual variety extends to the rest of their environment,
too. Forlorn habitats are riots of colors, small nooks and crannies filled
with bits of stuff, knicknacks, plants, materials 'put aside' (the Forlorn
are still fanatic recylclers...any bit of metal, plastic, wood or other
material that left over from anything, will get scooped up, and put aside
for recycling later.) Older Forlorn, in particular, also have a
significant 'thing-itis', the urge to collect all sorts of
'things'...mostly small and decorative, or something with some utility,
they are closer to the time when all they had was the 27; there are, in
fact a number of them who were alive before the fleet stopped.  They
remember the days when a small decorative object was truly a treasure,
when everything was assembled, atom by atom from the magnetic nets. <P>

The Forlorn, as a group have an acute awareness of the fact that they are
the only of their kind that have ever been found. A significant sect among
them are the 'Ill'ikashi', 'Rejoiners' in Galanglic. They believe that
when the great fleet was scattered, the 27 were not the only ships to
survive. If they were able to survive, then surely there were others. They
believe that it is a duty of theirs to seek out and find their lost
people, knowing that this is a monumental task. Their rituals are mostly
small reminders of the lost ships; on more important occasions, extra
place settings are set out for the lost, as if they might appear at any
moment. Astronomy and other sensor-based sciences are honored professions
among the Ill'ikashi, and they form the bulk of the Forlorn who work for
the IISS. <P>

The majority of the Forlorn, however, believe that they were the only ones
spared, and it is their duty to retain their history and traditions. A
formalized expression of this is the 'Deltra Harissim', literally the
'Society of Makers', a honorary fraternity of engineers, another
profession held in high esteem by the Forlorn. Members of the group are
the keepers of the 'Marakin' or 'Ships Log'; the recorded history of the
Forlorn.<P>

There are numerous facimile copies available, now that the Forlorn have
access to the materials and technology, but the Marakin, distinguished by
the capitalization, is still kept by the chief of the Deltra Harrisim,
using paper made from specialized groukit leaves. It is in the in the
center of Forlorn culture, on the 27, maintained now as a museum/shrine in
the Geshaggere system.<P>

The Marakin itself consists of some 4700 volumes of hand written history,
stretching back to the time immediately after The Destruction and the
scattering of the fleet. The earliest books are never handled any more,
they are the original engineers hasty notes on construction of the
original 27, listing the modifications to the ships controls and
mechanisms, inventories of material, preliminary designs of recycling
equipment, all written on cheap bound notepads, scraps of paper, bits of
packing....anything they could get their hands on. The Marakin evolved
into a written history about ten years into the voyage, as it seemed that
they might, after all, just might make it. These earliest volumes are far
too fragile to handle, and much of the information in them is impossible
to get to, and what is known about the contents has been lost or garbled
over the ages. The Deltra Harissim are undertaking research into how to
access the records without harming them, and the Ill'ikashi are
enthusiastic partners in this, as they believe clues to their origin, and
possible tracking the Lost Ships lie in these books. <P>

They have contracted with the Alkhalikoi Institute of Archaeology on Sylea
in this endeavor, and several visiting scientists from there are living
and working in the 27. <P>

One of them, Dr Muthahti Vinoosh, has written a minor best-seller
recounting her time on the Marakin project, and with the Forlorn. This
light, affectionate portrayal of her hosts has earned Dr. Vinoosh
reciprocal affection from the Forlorn, and has softened their image as
insular, arrogant masked strangers for a wider range of people in the
Imperium. <P>
