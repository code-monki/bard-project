The Zhodani Military was traditionally divided between
Consulate and local planetary forces.  Consulate
forces include the Consulate Navy and the Consulate
Guard, planetary forces were local armies and navies.
<P>
Like the former Imperial Navy, the Consualate Navy
consisted of front-line and reserve fleets.  Unlike
the Imperial Navy, the two categories were hardly
exclusive, nor were they necessarily both present at
the same time.  The Consulate had a couple of secure
borders, so the need for an everpresent naval force
was less stressed, especially in spinward sectors.
<P>
Most subsectors not facing the Imperium or the Vargr
mixed tech levels, and old and new vessels freely. In
wartime, however, newer units were apt to be stripped
for the front, leaving the older stuff behind. This
permitted a rather well trained reserve fleet, but
often undermined unit cohesion in frontline units.
The Zhodani fleet was also correspondingly lighter
than the Last Imperium's, in keeping with the Zhodani
doctrine for speed and lightning raids.
<P>
Zhodani task forces did not follow the Imperium's
segregated squadron structure, mixing naval units in a
complementary manner reminiscent of Black War units.
The Zhodani usually link together a couple of heavy
cruisers (70,000-90,000 tons) a handful of light
cruisers (10,000-45,000 tons), a lot of destroyers,
frigates, a few scouts, and always a couple of
carriers or fighter porters.  Battleships are the only
exception to the mixed squadron rule, and are always
deployed in mass with their own kind.  Battle Tenders
are rare in Zho service, as the slow pace of rider
recovery are anathema to the Zho's past-paced naval
tactics.  And when carriers are deployed, they carry
smaller airwings than are normally associated with
them.  However, the Zho's had lots of carriers,
ranging from the Shivva Patrol Frigate, to some
250,000 ton behemoths.
<P>
Supplementing the Navy were specialised Tavrchedl
patrol units that monitored civilian shipping and kept
an eye out for pirates, Imperial intruders and Vargr
corsairs.  Tavrchedl units were mostly 300-500 ton
gunboats and sloops, with minimal armaments but
extensive sensors and accomodations for psion
monitors. A number of "customs" craft are actually
Tavrchedl manned, and a fleet of 600 ton recon craft,
similar to the Imperial Donosev class, were deployed
for listening missions in remote territory, both
friendly and hostile.
<P>

<P>
The Consular Guard were the epitome of the Lighten up,
hit fast, hit hard philosophy.  CG units were mostly
drop or lift infantry, supplemented by their
ubiquitous combat robots, light MRLs and 5-8 ton
attack speeders. Battle Dress armored about 50% of
these troops, and grav belts were common.  Tanks were
only half as common as in equivalent Imperial
formations, and the infantry was heavily airmobile
dependent for its mobility. Equipment TLs varied
within the TL12-14 range, with frontline equipment or
the most critical of weapon systems being of the
highest levels, while secondary systems are cheaper
lower-tech models.
<P>
Zhodani Psionic Commando units were preciously rare,
and never deployed above company level, and even then
only for the most critical of missions.  The cost of
training and equipping these personnel rivaled TL8-9
fighter pilots, making them loss sensitive. Normally
these units were coordinated with ortillery/artillery,
other drop troops, or were sprinkled in with other
units to conceal them.  Ironically, their most
effective use wasn't in a direct attack role, but as
FOs for air and artillery attacks.  Given the
effective mobility of 'porters, and the ability of
directors to detect hidden units, these troops were
handily effective during orbital assualts, especially
in supressing enemy air defenses, and spotting
ambushes.
<P>
Zhodani battle robots were one of their few
significant contributions to battlefield technology.
The "Light" robot, copied by LSP as the PRS-317, was
first deployed in the Fifth Frontier War.  The
"Medium" and "Mantra" robots began to arrive just as
the war ended. A "Heavy" robot was under development
prior to the 1119 Rebellion, and it is thought that a
small number were deployed during that war. The SCR is
actually a large class of decoy, demolition and
reconnaissance units.
The Mantra is especially noteworthy. Designed to be
the space equivalent of ancient minisubs, the unit is
a 0.5 to 5 ton displacement hull rigged for
infiltration and sabotage of vital facilities and
orbiting spacecraft. Most are fitted with a nuclear or
conventional demolition charge, though a few carry
lasers or missles for defensive operations. Equipped
with CG lifters and a fusion cell, these craft were
designed for autonomous operations in gas giants or
ocean depths, hunting down refuelling spacecraft or
concealled SDBs. Another model has been deployed since
the Collapse, a 0.7 to 8 ton defensive unit designed
to protect LZs and backup high guards.

<P>
Some of the above weapons, in particular Zhodani
attack speeders and combat robots, were copied by
Regency/Imperial megacorps prior to the Civil War.
Since the Spinward Accords, many of these systems were
exported or manufactured under license for use by
Regency Planetary forces, and by a number of other
spinward states. Regency military designers managed to
acquire Guard battle dress for use as a template in
designing armor for psionic Regency Ranger and S-3
units.
