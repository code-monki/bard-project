All times are as according to the Imperial Calendar,
with Zhodani calendar in parentheses, where I figured
it out. It appears that the Zhodani were posting one
core expedition approx. every 350 olympiads (788
standard years) though most of the dates for the
missions intermediate the first and seventh are
conjecture.<P>


<P>
<B>-4000:</B></B> (1211.1) First Zhodani Core Expedition. Empress Wave (EW) is 1590 parsecs from modern Zhodani coreward frontier.
<P>
<B>-3210:</B> (1511.1) Second Core Expedition. EW is 1350parsecs to coreward.
<P>
<B>-2390:</B> Third Core Expedition.
<P>
<B>-1620:</B> Fourth Core Expedition. EW should have been
encountered during this expedition, as it was only 870
parsecs from the Zhodani frontier. That means the
Zhodani knew about it for at least 2500 to 2700 years
BEFORE Longbow detected it.
<P>
<B>-810:</B> Fifth Core Expedition
<P>
<B>-20 to -30:</B> Sixth Core Expedition
<P>
<B>589-604:</B> First Frontier War

Qlom province.

coreward of Zhdant.
<P>
<B>979-986:</B> Third Frontier War
<P>
<B>994:</B> EW breaks on Zhodani core frontier.
<P>
<B>Approx. 1090-1115:</B> Longbow detects unusual shipping
patterns and evidence of space combat moving down
Zhodani Core Axis.
<P>
<B>1116:</B> Longbow detects EW. Strephon's double
assasinated, Imperial Civil War begins. (At this time,
the EW was less than a sector away from the Imperial
border.)
<P>
<B>1119:</B> Evidence of internal Zhodani insurrection
detected at Esalin/Spinward Marches. (See survival
margin)
<P>
<B>1123:</B> Zhodani Tozjabr hit squad rumored to be
dispatched to assasinate then-Archduke Norris.
<P>
<B>1130:</B> AI virus released, Third Imperium collapses.
<P>
<B>1131:</B> Spinward Accords signed, Quarantine established.
<P>
