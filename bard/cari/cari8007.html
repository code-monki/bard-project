 This is an example of game fusion.  White Wolf's "World of Darkness" Seting
 applied and reconfiged(hacked is a better word) to fit with GDW's Traveller
 Universe.<P>
 
 (Hey Kids, Don't try game fusion at home. The ol' Commander remembers one
 incedent with Rifts and C'thulu that ended with disastrous results!)<P>
 
 Ok, here we go.  First on the List. Wampyres! ..er I mean Vampires.<P>
 
 Ah, vampires!  Not the kind that are Virus driven ships, but the Vampires of
 Ancient Terran, Vilani, Zhodani, Darrien...hmm, seems that most Alien
 cultures have Vampire legends in there somewhere.  Anyway, Vampires.<P>
 
 Here's the curent theory.  Vamprism is caused by a symbiotic lifeform (oh
 those little life-forms!) This lifeform is also known as Vampiric Blood, or
 Dead Blood.  The symbiot is hemovorous, meaning it subsists off of what boys
 and girls? (there will be a test later!)  Yes little Johnny! thats right!
 Blood!  It don't care if you are Human, Vargr, Aslan or whatever. All blood is
 good blood!<P>
 
 Now in return for feeding this little lifeform, it gives you pretty darn
 near eternal life.  These little lifeforms need a host, and as the symbiots
 live longer than humans (Yes even longer than Vilani on anagathics!) it keeps
 the host alive, how it does this is not rightly known.<P>
 
 You must contine to feed the lifeforms, if you go without blood,  the
 symbiot takes over and trys to find the nearest blood it can find, this is
 also known as the Frenzie!<P>
 
 That's the basics, now here come the game mechanics<P>
 
 Vampires have what are known as "Blood Points".  The initial maximum number
 of Blood points is equal to the vampires CON. This blood pool maximum can be
 increased through experience points used in the normal fashion.  (7 points
 to raise to 7, 8 points to raise to 8, etc...).<P>
 
 How are Blood points used, they are used for psionic effects.  All Vampires
 get the ability of Self(Regeneration).  Now heres the scary part.  Use of
 Bloodpoints allow the automatic success of any Psionic talent at the same
 level the Bloodpoints are used.  For Example, If a Vamp was delt a serious
 wound, he could use his Blood points to reduce that down to a scratch wound.
 (3 Blood points= Level 3 effect)<P>
 
 To Get Bloodpoints back: Drink Blood!<P>
 
 The Vampire has the option of drinking a lifeform "dry" and therefore
 getting bloodpoints equal to the lifeforms CON, or to only drink a little,
 geting a portion of the total BP.  For animals, it's GM's Judgement. Small
 1bp, medium 4bp, etc...<P>
 
<B> Powers:</B>
 The Self Psionics cluster is the only cluster in which Blood points can be
 used, other Psionics must be learned in the normal fashion. You might want
 to record on character sheets as Self-Vampiric.
 This allows the Vampire to use bloodpoints in the following:
 <UL>
 Regeneration<BR>
 Suspended Animation<BR>
 Orientation<BR>
 Psi-Enhaced STR<BR>
 Psi-Enhanced CON<BR>
 </ul>
 
 Also, as long as you have the bloodpoints, you might as well ignore the
 ageing effects chart. You stay as young (or old) as you were when you were
 "Changed". This main effect of the symbiots eats 1bp per day.<P>
 
 
<B> Limitations:</B>
 As stated before, UV light affects the Symbiots adversely, damage is doubled
 to the Host if hit with a UV laser, direct UV like from a star, WILL KILL THEM!<P>
 
 Energy attacks or fire will do Agrivated Dammage, dammage which cannot be
 healed using the Self-Vampiric ability.  This is because some of the
 symbiots have died off in the wounded area.<P>
 
 The vampiric symbiots will reject any type of food that is not blood, that
 is you can't digest or even tolerate real food.  With experience points
 Vamps can learn "Tolerate Food" skill which has CON as the controlling
 atribute. Use of the skill is Difficult.<P>
 
 A stake through the heart will IMMOBILIZE a Vampire, due to the nature of
 the symbiots, they must be in continous flow throughout the body, stop the
 heart, and you stop the flow.<P>
 
 Vampires can exist in a vacuum for a time, up to CON x Miniutes, after that
 they go into a state of Suspended animation called Torpor. This also happens
 when the Vamp runs out of Bloodpoints and cannot find a fresh source of
 Blood in 24 hours. Basicaly the symbiots shut down, but don't die!
 <P>
 Also, When 0 Bloodpoints are reached a vampire must make a Difficult
 Willpower check or go into a bezerk frenzie untill he can feed.<P>
 
 Well, that's about that for playing Vamps in Traveller.
 I caution GM's out there to only use this for NPC Villians, unless you are
 ready to handle PC vampires.  They can be powerful. Especialy if they are
 allowed to live a while.  Even so, Vampires in Traveller should be RARE!
 They are just something for the GM to use once in a blue moon, for a horror
 adventure.  But if you like the idea of a "TRULY Dark Traveller", hey It's
 your campaign.<P>
