<H1>Jgd-Il-Jagd</H1>
 
<H5>by  Paul J. Drye</H5>

<HR><p>

 
The Jgd-Il-Jagd (the "Jgd" for short, possessive "Jgdi") are a technically
advanced race hailing from Jagd, a large gas giant at 2307 Lishun. This
article is intended as an expansion and update of the original article
detailing the Jgd in the <cite>Journal of the Travellers' Aid Society</cite> #17(authored by Phil Masters). I will
be using this article as the background for an adventure to be submitted to
Challenge. <p>
 
I have made the assumption throughout this article that the Jgd are one of
the most "major" minor races in the Imperium. This seems reasonable to me
based on their high level of technology, as well as the alienness of it. By
being so alien the Jgd are good at making items that are very, very difficult
for more normal races to build. As a result, their goods are much sought
after, and the Jgd are quite affluent.<p>
 
The Jgd have proven very difficult to communicate with. Throughout this
article I have used phrases like "seems to" and "apparently" in order to
reflect the difficulties in obtaining information from the Jgd.
 <p>
<hr>
<p>
<A NAME="biology"><H3>Biology</H3></A>
 <p>
The Jgdi body is a roughly spherical balloon about three metres in diameter.
The balloon is filled with hydrogen gas which allows a Jgd to float in the
atmosphere of their homeworld. Around the "waist" are three manipulative
tentacles which further divide into four fingers near the end of their length.
Clusters of sensory equipment are grouped randomly around the body, with the
greatest concentration at the base. A dozen small manipulative tendrils and
a half dozen mouths are also located at the base.
 <p>
Jagd is very cool by human standards, hovering just below the boiling point
of ammonia at the heights where the Jgd live. Given the low temperatures it
is not surprising that the Jgd live off chemical reactions quite unlike those
used by Humans. Instead of combining hydrocarbons and water from food with
oxygen from the air, the Jgd ingest hydrocarbons as food and combine it with
hydrogen and liquid ammonia to produce water, methane and energy.
 <p>
<i>I have been stymied trying to find out which freezes first, ammonia or
methane. I have decided on the latter, but if I have mixed up the two, reverse
them in your head as you read this and let me know</i>.
 <p>
The Jgd reproduce by means of binary fission. Until the discovery of the Jgd
it was believed by Solomani and Vilani science that it was impossible for
complex forms of life to arise without some exchange of genetic materials
fuelling natural selections, and in most cases this is correct. In the case
of Jagd, however, the background radiation emanating from the depths of the
planet is so high that it causes a reasonable mutation rate without the
benefit of sexual reproduction.
 <p>
All throughout life a Jgd grows, eventually reaching a diameter of four metres
at age 200. At this time a Jgd will gradually grow a dividing skin throughout
its entire body, running from "head"-to-"toe". Each of the arms of the Jgd
will split down their length, with each of the pieces growing new fingers and
becoming a fully functional arm. At the age of 210 the Jgd will enter a month
long period of hibernation. It will split into two pieces along the dividing
skin retaining only a small connecting tissue to pass required bodily fluids
while each piece grows new organs to replace those left behind. At the end of
the month the connection will break leaving two individuals. One of these
individuals continues the life of the "parent", while the other begins a new
career. Exactly how it is decided which individual is which is unknown, as all
attempts to explain by the Jgd have defied translation. It also appears that
over the course of three or four divisions the memories of the parent are
gradually replaced by the memories of the new individuals. By age 630 or so
the entire sum of the parent is lost.
 <p>
<i>The original Jgd article says "Average life of an identifiable Jgd
individual...is approximately 630 plus standard Imperial years". By carrying
individuality over the generations I have kept this statement true while
allowing the Jgd to increase the numbers at a reasonable rate. If they
reproduced only every 630 years even their oldest colonies would have only
gone through a few generations, and have had a correspondingly small
population. Also see below for the "forced reproduction" the Jgd can undergo</i>.
 <p>
Modern Jgdi science has developed a means of causing reproduction at age 10
or less. This method is invariably used during the early stages of colonizing
a world, but it seems that the Jgd find forced reproduction distasteful and
discard the process as soon as the colony has reached an adequate size.
 <p>
The Jgd only have three senses. Their main sense corresponds to hearing, in
that they are very responsive to atmospheric vibration over their entire body.
Using this sense they are capable of obtaining as much information about their
surroundings as humans are from sight. Their second sense perceives
electromagnetic radiation from the lower end of the shortwave radio band to
the far ultraviolet, but only to the extent of whether it is there or not, not
true sight. Their last sense is touch, and is very much like our own sense of
touch.
 <p>
The Jgd have two main means of communication, the first being a long-distance
language using infrasonic tones. Using this language a Jgd can communicate
over tremendous distances (twenty or more kilometres). Apparently these sounds
can be used to communicate only simple concepts and do not appear to be a real
language. It can be compared instead to hand gestures used by humans to
communicate in a pinch. The sounds are not produced by means of a specialized
organ, but are instead made by vibrating the entire surface of a Jgd's
balloon-like body.
 <p>
<The original article states that the Jgd use ULTRAsonic sounds, but this does
not quite make sense, as ultrasonic sounds would probably not carry as far
twenty kilometres. After all, to go twenty kilometres they would have to be
quite loud, and since volume has to do with the amplitude of the wave it is
difficult to envision a small membrane vibrating with a large amplitude
without ripping itself. A large membrane (in this case the entire body of the
Jgd) could produce the necessary amplitude, because the size of the amplitude
is not as great relative to the size of the membrane>.
 <p>
Much more effective for communicating is the manner in which the Jgd can pass
information by direct physical contact. Using this method a Jgd can transfer
vast amounts of information in a relatively short time. It is believed that
the Jgd do not perceive this as "language" either, which further complicates
the communication between humans and Jgd. Rather it is a literal transmission
of the experience being explained. It is entirely possible that the Jgd
receiving the information now believes that it was actually "there" when the
transmitted experience occurred. This has had an interesting effect on the
Jgdi understanding of causality. Between their main means of communication and
the manner in which they reproduce, it is not beyond the bounds of reason to
view the Jgd as a group mind with a slow reaction time.
 <p>
Jgdi memories apparently have a near infinite capacity, so the Jgdi ability
to learn and transfer information is incredible. Only one Jgd has to learn
anything for it to be possible for the rest of the Jgdi species to learn it
as well. In practice this rarely happens due to time limitations (a Jgd would
have to do nothing but learn twenty-four hours a day to keep up), but the
average Jgd is still ridiculously well-educated by human standards.
 <p>
Another effect of this great memory and ease of information transfer is the
lack of a Jgdi written language. The Jgd even have memories extending as far
back as the very earliest days of the Jgd. Much information has been lost just
through the deaths of the sole individuals holding various memories, but there
is really no such thing as a Jgdi prehistory.
 <p>
One more remarkable fact about Jgdi physiology remains unknown to Imperial
science: they are incapable of entering jumpspace without large amounts of
protection. Jgdi jump travelling capsules are opaque to virtually any type of
radiation imaginable including electromagnetic, gravitic, pseudo-gravitic (the
basis of anti-grav technology), neutrinos, mesons, and even virtual particles.
The only means to communicate with a Jgd in one of these capsules is to get
it out, and this is not a good idea unless one desires a Jgdi corpse.
 <p>
If a Jgd is caught outside its capsule while in jumpspace it immediately
enters a state of neural shock and dies within a few hours. The reason for
this is unknown even to the Jgd.
 <p>
The reason the neural shock effect is unknown to Imperials is simple: the Jgd
discovered this effect themselves during their experiments with jump drive
shortly after contact with the Vilani. By the time they were first offered a
"ride" they had developed a method of circumventing it. They have simply not
communicated the effect to human scientists. Death is a tricky concept in any
language, and even more so for the Jgd, since a dead Jgd's memories are still
floating around in many other Jgdi minds. Efforts to explain by the Jgd have
defeated all translation attempts, and the Jgd have moved onto other, easier
topics.
 <p>
<i>The original article makes it very clear that this effect is not known within
the Imperium. The Jgd must have discovered this effect themselves or else it
would be widely known. Imperial scientists are always on the outlook for clues
as to how jumpspace really works and would have descended on Jagd like flies
if they had known about it</i>.
 <p>

<A NAME="psych"><H3>Psychology</H3></A>
<p>

The single most remarkable thing about Jgdi psychology is the race's obsession
with symmetry. To them symmetry in any form has value, and the closer the
correlation between things the greater the value. As well as aesthetic value
symmetry has monetary value. Running a trading session using Jgdi symmetry is
a little like a poetry session, in the sense that the Jgd will admire the
symmetry of any trade, pointing out the symmetries that perhaps the other
party may have missed. The amount of goods necessary to make a deal "even"
depends of the level of symmetry perceived. Jgd do not hold back about
symmetries in order to make the deal better for themselves. Humans may do so
if they wish, but the Jgd will be angered if they discover the deception.
  <p>
Trade is the manner in which humans deal with Jgd the most often, but desire
for symmetry runs through all Jgdi society. For example, beginning a
conversation is guaranteed to get a response, even if the response is only "I
cannot speak with you now".
  <p>
When it comes to Jgdi reproduction, occasionally a Jgd will fission before all
six arms have developed. One new Jgd will get three arms and the other will
get the rest. The Jgd that is shy a few arms will die if it does not receive
immediate regenerative treatment at a Jgdi hospital (the arms will not develop
by themselves in time). It is not known why the Jgd will die, but it probably
has to do with the violation of symmetry playing on the Jgdi mind.
  <p>
Jgdi law is very much based on symmetry, ensuring that the punishment
literally fits the crime. Some human observers have seen this as brutal "eye
for an eye" justice, but the Jgd are not the primitive humans who developed
this original precept of law. Their system of law is every bit as
sophisticated as human law.
  <p>
Jgd live in groups called hunts. Hunts are highly variable in shape and form,
but originally developed from hunter-gather groups in pretechnical days.
Nowadays any coherent organization of Jgd is composed of a single hunt or, if
the organization naturally breaks itself into several categories or
departments, one hunt per category.
  <p><hr><p>
<A NAME="history"><H3>Early History</H3></A>
  <p>c
Life on Jagd is quite unlike that on Terra. It began some three billion years
ago in the lower depths of Jagd when small, single-celled life forms appeared.
At first these lifeforms lived off a much simpler chemical reaction than the
one the Jgd use now, converting methane into carbon and ammonia. The amount
of atmospheric nitrogen available to drive this reaction was very small,
however, and after a few tens of millions of years it ran out. The resulting
crisis placed tremendous evolutionary pressure on Jagdish life and ended up
producing multi-cellular creatures using the opposite reaction, thus striking
a balance between the two types of life.
  <p>
This second type of life was at first restricted to the ammonia seas of Jagd,
but soon developed means of trapping hydrogen gas and using it to float in
the huge atmosphere of their planet. Some of these creatures became
triphibians living in the oceans, the air, and on the only solid "land" on
Jagd: solid methane icebergs floating in the ammonia seas. These animals went
on to become the Jgd-Il-Jagd.
  <p>
When the Jgd first came into being some two hundred thousand years ago they
were without real technology for a very long time. Shards of methane ice were
used as weapons, and slushy clathrates of methane, water and ammonia were
gathered into pools to trap prey, but no advancement took place. No
sustainable reaction like fire could occur on Jagd, and metals were rare in
the extreme, with only small chunks welling up from the planet's core during
Jagdish hurricanes.
  <p>
In this environment the Jgd became a race of thinkers. Dozens of Jgdi Euclids
and Einsteins came and went, developing Jgdi mathematics, physics, and art to
tremendous heights without the benefit of experimentation. Often they were
spectacularly wrong in their views, but they were often right as well. When
techniques were developed that allowed technical advancement and the Jgd could
apply their vast theoretical knowledge their culture flowered.
  <p>
The first breakthrough came about -12 000 from a small Jgdi settlement near
a semi-permanent upwelling of gases from the lower levels of Jagd. A method
was discovered by a local smith of bathing methane ice in the rising plumes
of gas (rich in "exotic" elements like fluorine, magnesium and argon) to
produce a complex material that could be worked into useful shapes. The method
spread rapidly, and soon the Jgd had devised dozens, then hundreds of new
processes for manipulating the materials available to them.
  <p>
<i>This is, of course, pseudoscientific gobbledygook. I have no idea what this
"complex material" is. But it sounds good, and I defy anyone to prove it is
impossible.</i>
  <p>
Given the ease with which the Jgd can pass information these techniques soon
spread far and wide throughout Jagd, and transformed Jgdi life. Within a few
hundred years the Jgd had leapfrogged from tech 1 to somewhere in the vicinity
of tech 11. Jump drive was not developed for reasons outlined below, but the
Jgd began building huge generation ships capable of 0.25c, using thruster
technology for propulsion. The Jgdi obsession with symmetry slowed their
expansion into space, as they first sent out exploration ships to explore and
then return, then they would send colony ships to colonize their discoveries.
No worlds truly suitable for Jgdi life were discovered, but several worlds
acceptable as outposts were discovered and used.
  <p>
<i>0.25c is the approximate speed of the sub-light ships used to colonize the
Islands Cluster in Trillion Credit Squadron, ships which were about tech 11,
I think</i>.
  <p>
By -9100 the Jgd had explored and colonized an area of space four parsecs in
radius.
  <p>
<hr><p>
<A NAME="humans"><H3>Interaction with Humans</H3></A>
  <p>
In -9100 the Vilani encountered the Jagd at one of their colony worlds and
immediately came to Jagd. Jgdi-made goods became, if not common, at least not-
unheard-of throughout Vilani space. Communication difficulties were
tremendous, mainly because Jgdi "memory-sharing" could not be used with
mechanical translators, and their cumbersome sonic language had to be used
instead. The name "Jgd-Il-Jagd" is a corruption of the noise produced by one
of these translators when the Jgd were first asked their names, long before
any meaningful conversation was possible. Even today communication with Jgd
on any topic other than trading is difficult. The Jgd, however, were the first
race the Vilani had encountered that were more or less on a technological par
with the Vilani <Any arguments?> and economic ties were eventually set up that
were beneficial for both species.
  <p>
The Jgd-Il-Jagd bothered the Vilani, however, as their sheer alienness made
it very difficult for the Vilani to exert the same control over them as they
did other races. Subtly, attitudes shifted away from the initial goodwill
between the two species, and the Vilani stopped trading with the Jgd about -
7000. During the Consolidation Wars it was decided that the Jgdi worlds would
be interdicted and the Jgd prevented from expanding any further. The Jgdi
government of Jagd was informed of the interdiction then left to decide how
they would deal with it. Thankfully the Jgd realized that a massacre was in
the offing if they attempted to resist and they instead contented themselves
with what they had.
  <p>
Thanks to the interdiction the Jgd were utterly unaffected by the decline and
fall of the Ziru Sirka and were, in fact, caught completely off-guard when  the
 Solomani ship <i>Heinlein</i> came to make contact in -2211. The Solomani demand for
Jgdi goods was insatiable and the Jgd rapidly became one of the most affluent
of all races. Using this money the Jgd began buying themselves into regions
of space they could not reach with their sub-light ships. By the time of the
Rebellion the Jgd had several colonies throughout the Imperium.
  <p>
All throughout the Rule of Man, the Long Night, and the Third Imperium the Jgd
have remained independent of any human government. Since the end of the Ziru
Sirka no attempt has been made to control the Jgd, and the Imperium considered
the Jgdi spheres of influences as a independent client state. Whether the Jgdi
view themselves as clients is unknown.
  <p>
Since the collapse of Imperial authority in Lishun the contact with Jagd has
been lost, but there is no reason to believe that the Jgd are in any danger
from the Vargr. Since the lifting of the interdiction the Jgd have regularly
armed their craft with high-tech weapons. Vargr corsairs would likely be
completely overmatched by Jgdi system defenses.
  <p><hr><p>
 <A NAME="tech"><H3>Technology</H3></A>

Jgdi technology is wildly different from that of the Imperium. Rather than
being based on metals and fire like our own it is instead based on crystals
and chemistry. Since tech "levels" are a set of artificial categories devised
by humans to describe the technology they see around them, the system breaks
down when used to describe Jgdi technology.
  <p>
Jgdi vehicular and communications technology is at tech 12.
  <p>
Jgdi energy and materials technology is a tech 15 or higher. Since Jgdi
materials science is based on crystals instead of metals the Jgdi are capable
of feats that seem magical to humans (this attitude is probably shared by the
Jgd when it comes to humans and metals). For example, Jgdi ship hulls are
often built of single crystals. Jgdi computers are exceptionally flexible,
small, and power-frugal. The Jgd have even come up with a method of storing
water as a solid at temperatures well above freezing, though it is mostly
considered a novelty.
  <p>
<hr><p>
<A NAME="colonies"><H3>Colonies</H3></A>

  <p>
A world must meet stringent requirements before a Jgd can live on it
unprotected. Before they met the Vilani the Jgd had found no worlds upon which
they could live, just gas giants that were suitable as colonies only with
protection. Once the Rule of Man began the Jgd began purchasing astrographic
information from the Solomani. New worlds suitable for Jgdi habitation were
discovered here and there throughout the Second Imperium, and plans were made
to colonize them.
  <p>
No habitable gas giant was close enough to Jagd to be reached with sub-light
ships, so the Jgd arranged to have large numbers of themselves transported to
the new worlds via jump ships. During one of these endeavours dozens of
trading ships would be hired to take on cargoes of Jgd and their jump-
travelling capsules, as well as equipment for use at the other end of the
journey. Over the course of several years as many as forty thousand Jgd would
be transported to the new world.
  <p>
Once the new colony is well-established (two hundred years is the norm) it
begins building sub-light ships to colonize the nearby less-than-perfect
systems. Among the criteria used for selecting a new colony is the extent to
which surrounding gas giants can be developed, even if they are imperfectly
habitable. The net effect of this colonization method is to produce small
bubbles of Jgd-inhabited space widely separated from each other. These bubbles
are called "clades".
  <p>
Unsurprisingly, setting up colonies in this manner is very expensive, even
for a race as well-off as the Jgd. In the course of Jgdi history only six
colonies have been begun, two during the Rule of Man and four during the Third
Imperium (with a hiatus in colonization during the Long Night). One of these
clades is within K'kree space.
  <p>

Jgd inhabited worlds, the year they were colonized, and the radii of the clade
they centre are as follows:
<table>
<tr><th>World<th>                        Year <th>               Clade Radius    </tr>

 </table>

 <p>
The number of worlds inhabited within each clade depends on the ability of
the central world to support colonies on poorly habitable worlds.
 <p>
Jgd also inhabit single gas giants outside of clades if they feel the economic
benefits of a colony their outweigh the disadvantages of living on an
imperfectly habitable world. Generally this means systems containing worlds
with trade classifications of Hi, In, or Ri.
 <p>
There are also several Jgdi space habitats permanently in orbit around worlds
throughout the Imperium. This method is rarely used by the Jgd as it reduces
their ability to create technical items by removing their sources of raw
materials, their gas giant homes. Habitats are only encountered in systems
that are of great importance and do not have any gas giants that are even
marginally habitable to a Jgd.
 <p>
It should be pointed out that worlds inhabitable by Jgd have surface areas
hundreds of times larger than worlds inhabited by humans. Even given the size
of space an individual Jgd needs, any amenable world can support tens of
billions of Jgd. The total population of Jgd within the former boundaries of
the Third Imperium is believed to be in excess of 250 billion. The populations
of colonies on uninhabitable worlds are at most a few tens of millions.
 <p><hr><p>
 <A NAME="game"><H3>Game Rules</H3></A>
 <p>
The Jgd are treated as animals for combat purposes, because of their highly
alien nature. Mature Jgd have 5D hits for unconsciousness and a further 4D to
death. Encountered in their natural habitat their leathery skins give them the
equivalent of jack armour. Outside of their habitat they wear armour to
protect themselves equal to battle dress. Their travel capsules contain 2D Jgd
and have an armour equivalent of a starship hull (40).
 <p>
Jgdi mental skills can be dealt with using characteristics. Intelligence is
2D+2, and education is 1D+7. Jgdi social standing among themselves is
incomprehensible to us, but among humans recognized individuals (and there are a
few) have social statuses of 1D+3. They tend to be wealthy, but cannot be
nobles.
 <p>
Jgdi ships vary greatly in design (there is no recognizable Jgdi ship
manufacturing industry as they do not have enough traffic to support it). In-
system ships range between 2000 and 10 000 tons. Interstellar craft start at
75 000 tons and go up to 700 000 tons, with the bulk of them towards the high
end of the range.
 <p>
Ships are heavily armed with lasers, repulsors, nuclear dampers
and meson screens (tech 14). Missiles and sandcasters are rare and only tech
7.
 <p>
Jgdi ships never have jump drives. Propulsion is invariably done using
thruster technology. The Jgdi are used to a gravity of 3G, and can take much
higher g-forces if they stay afloat in the atmosphere of their ship. Ship
accelerations match accordingly.
 <p>
Jgdi worlds can be found anywhere and will be found on a 20+ on 2D with the
following modifiers:

roll 1D-1.
 <p>
Jgdi worlds at the centres of clades have a tech level of 15. Always. Jgd can
transfer information too easily for it to be otherwise. Other worlds in the
same clade have tech levels of 13 to 15, as do habitats. Worlds outside any
clade have tech levels of 9+1D.
 <p>
The Jgdi do not have an armed forces per se. Bases are merely defensive in
nature and are noted with the code D. They are ubiquitous however, and are
present on a 3+.

First, the basics:<br>
 
To make a Jgd understand a sentence using a translator<ul>
Routine, Computer, Liaison, 15 seconds
 </ul>
The Jgd do not have a concept of money. They always barter.
 <p>
Decide whether the goods being offered by the characters are Not Similar,
Vaguely Similar, Similar, or Very Similar to the goods wanted in return. The
Jgd will make an initial offer based on this distinction. The value of the
goods offered in return is as follows:
 <p>
<table>
<tr><td>Not Similar   <td>       100-(2Dx10) percent of the value in Cr on the nearest  
                             human world</tr> 
<tr><td>Vaguely Similar<td>      100-(1Dx5) percent    </tr>                                  
<tr><td>Similar       <td>      100+(1Dx5) percent       </tr>                               
<tr><td>Very Similar  <td>       100+(2Dx10) percent </tr>                                   
</table>

An offer of 0% means the Jgd will not accept the goods offered in return for
its goods.<p>
 
The players may attempt to change the ranking of their goods using the
following task rolls:<p>
 
To convince a Jgd of the existence of a symmetry that actually exists
Routine, Artisan, Liason, 30 seconds (unskilled OK, fateful)
 <p>
A successful roll ups the symmetry of the good one level. On a superficial or
minor mishap the symmetry is merely not appreciated by the Jgd. On major or
destroyed mishaps the Jgd will disagree entirely and up its price one level.
 <p>
To convince a Jgd of the existence of a symmetry that does not exist
Difficult, Liason, 30 seconds (unskilled OK, fateful)
 <p>
A successful roll ups the symmetry of the good one level. On a superficial
mishap the Jgd will believe the character but will not appreciate the
symmetry. On other mishaps the Jgd will realize the player is trying to cheat
it and break off the negotiation.
