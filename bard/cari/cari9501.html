There is a breed of cats called "Ship's Cats" that have
been specifically bred to serve on space ships. There have been
small amounts of genetic tinkering in their line. This has mainly
been changes to their instinctual reactions to certain things.
Of course the original product has interbred and changed over time
leaving a species which is partially engineered and partially
adapted.
	  <P>Ship's Cats can deal well with changes in gravity and
can cope quite well in zero-G. Most understand standard "brace
for acceleration" warnings and can act accordingly. Special
cat-spacesuits are available on the market and it takes minimal
training for a cat to learn how to get in and seal themselves.
	  <P>Although they are still competent at chasing out small
vermin of a variety of species (which *still* can cause problems
on ships) they are less skilled at this than their terrestrial
companions. They do have a keen sensitivity to changes in
pressure and electrical disturbances. Often their behaviour can
point to potential problems.
	  <P>They tend to understand the difference between Crew and
Passengers and are good at not being seen by people who would not
appreciate seeing them. Exceptional specimens can even distinguish
between High and Middle passengers.
	  <P>Ships Cats are more restrained in their breeding habits.
They tend to remain infertile for long periods during travel.
They will come into heat when at dock for an extended period,
such as during annual maintenance. Also if they are with another
animal that is not a near relation they will move into a breeding
cycle. Their ability to distinguish relations is based on scent
and makes it safe to have more than one cat from one family on
a ship.
	  <P>The offspring of these family units are highly sought
after. Many of their skills are learned from their parents and
the type of ship they were raised on. As such there are Navy
breeds, Merchant breeds, etc, etc. Certain family lines are
widely known and the subject of idle dockside talk.
	  <P>Most spaceports allow registered ship's cats into
their extrality zone with the same processing as for crew.
All such animals must be identified, though.
