When 
<!A HREF="../hana/hana####.html">Virus</A> was accidently released by 
<!A HREF="../hana/hana####.html">Dulinor's forces</A>, it didn't 
just ravage the 
<!A HREF="../hana/hana####.html">Imperium; it also destroyed the 
surrounding empires. The 
<!A HREF="cari####.html">Hiver</A> were able to protect some 
worlds from total devestation, and lessen the impact on others.  
After they dealt with the initial destruction, the 
<!A HREF="cari####.html">Hiver</A>, in their parental, manipulative 
way, began discussing what should become of humans.  Should the 
<!A HREF="cari####.html">Hivers</A> help them rebuild, conquer 
them and then manipulate them into a more peaceful species, or 
just destroy them and let a new species have their worlds?  
After a decade long discussion, and probably several minor 
manipulations, the 
<!A HREF="cari####.html">Hive Federation</A> decided that they 
would seek out worlds that had survived the 
<!A HREF="../hana/hana####.html">Collapse</A> with a progressive 
government and help them reconquer the 
<!A HREF="../gail/gail####.html">Wilds</A>. The 
<!A HREF="../hana/hana####.html">Reformation Coalition</A> is the 
most famous example of this decision.<P>

Most 
<!A HREF="cari####.html">Hiver</A> were persuaded that this was 
the best course of action, but not all. A few 
<!A HREF="cari####.html">Hiver</A> thought, and still think, that 
Humans are too dangerous, and when they form a new interstellar 
empire, it will only be a matter of time, before they start 
fighting and thereby bring destruction to the universe again. The 
<!A HREF="../hana/hana####.html">Third Imperium</A> had just 
collapsed, how many more tries would humans need before they get 
it right.  Also, a new human empire would probably come into 
conflict with the 
<!A HREF="cari####.html">Federation</A>; before the 
<!A HREF="../hana/hana####.html">Collapse</A> tensions were 
increasing with the racist 
<!A HREF="cari####.html">Solomani</A>.<P>

These 
<!A HREF="cari####.html">Hiver's</A> driving purpose is to protect the 
<!A HREF="cari####.html">Federation</A> from the ravages of the 
humans, but they are divided on how best to do this. Some want 
to keep the humans divided and technologically primitive. A few 
point out that several types of minor human races are members of the
<!A HREF="cari####.html">Hive Federation</A>, and are upstanding 
members, these 
<!A HREF="cari####.html">Hiver</A> want to slowly absorb the 
humans into the 
<!A HREF="cari####.html">Federation</A>.<P>
 
Other 
<!A HREF="cari####.html">Hiver</A> feel that humans are just too 
dangerous and should be exterminated and their planets colonized by 
<!A HREF="cari####.html">Federation</A> races.  They all agree, 
however, that the 
<!A HREF="../hana/hana####.html">Reformation Coalition</A> must not 
be allowed to succeed.<P>

These renegade 
<!A HREF="cari####.html">Hiver</A> have formed a secret network of 
several dozen 
<!A HREF="cari####.html">Manipulators</A>, and a couple hundred 
normal 
<!A HREF="cari####.html">Hiver</A>.  They also command the loyalty 
of thousands of members of 
<!A HREF="cari####.html">Federation</A> client races.  The 
<!A HREF="cari####.html">Manipulators</A> each have their own 
plans, but they communicate and many times are able to share 
resources and information.  Some of the 
<!A HREF="cari####.html">Hiver</A> are secretly inside the 
<!A HREF="../hana/hana####.html">Coalition</A>, others have bases in the 
<!A HREF="../gail/gail####.html">Wilds</A>, still others remain in the 
<!A HREF="cari####/html">Federation</A>.  Each of these so called 
Shadow Nests pose a serious threat to the 
<!A HREF="../hana/hana####.html">Coalition</A>.<P>

Some of the Shadow Nests are working towards the extinction of 
humans. They plan to do this by distributing high tech weapons of 
mass destruction to balkanized worlds, releasing bioweapons on 
high population planets, and causing friction among the members of the 
<!A HREF="../hana/hana####.html">Coalition</A>, until civil war 
breaks out. Some Shadow Nests even go so far as to provide 
weapons to 
<!A HREF="../gail/gail####.html">Vampire Ships</A>.<P>

Other Shadow Nests want to keep humans divided, they encourage 
xenophobia in the Wilds by encouraging the 
<!A HREF="../hana/hana####.html">Coalition</A> to run violent 
<!A HREF="../gail/gail####.html">smash and grab operations</A> that 
only serve to turn the people against the 
<!A HREF="../hana/hana####.html">RC</A>.  They manipulate the 
<!A HREF="../gail/gail####.html">Guild</A> into expanding its 
slave trade and raids against primitive people to further the 
xenophobia.<P>

Finally, other Shadow Nests want to bring the humans into the 
<!A HREF="cari####.html">Federation</A>. Most realize that there 
are too many humans to safely bring in and the humans need to 
be culled. They also encourage 
<!A HREF="cari####.html">Federation</A> races to colonize 
promising human worlds. A few Nests want to genetically engineer 
the humans to get rid of their more agressive features, but most 
<!A HREF="cari####.html">Hiver</A> find genetic engineering of a 
sentient species to be rather crude, and psychological 
manipulation to be much more elegant.<P>
