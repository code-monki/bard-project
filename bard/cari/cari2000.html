The sixth attribute in the UPP of a Vargr character is called
"Personality" (not "Charisma") so as to distinguish this attribute from
the new pseudo-attribute "Vargr Charisma/Dominance" (see below). 
Personality (PRS) is used in place of the usual attribute Charimsa (CHR)
in all ways.  All CHR-based skills are instead based on PRS for Vargr. <P> 

<b>Vargr Charimsa/Dominance (VCD): </b><p>

This pseudo-attribute replaces Social Standing (SOC) in all ways.  All
references to SOC instead refer to VCD for Vargr characters.  <P>

 VCD can be changed (increased and/or decreased) as a result of career
    resolution: <P>

    <LI> When making a Commission roll: 
<UL>
      <LI> Succeeding by 2+ points gives +1 to VCD;
      <LI> Failing by 2+ points gives -1 to VCD.  
</ul>
    When making a Promotion roll:
<UL>
      <LI> Succeeding by 2 or 3 points gives +1 to VCD;
      <LI> Succeeding by 4+ points gives +2 to VCD;
      <LI> Failing by 2 or 3 points gives -1 to VCD;
      <LI> Failing by 4+ points gives -2 to VCD.  
</UL>

   VCD can also change as a result of adventuring.  At the end of an
    adventure, when awarding XP, the player rolls a Difficult test of the
    Vargr character's Leadership skill <B>opposed</B> by the Vargr's current
    VCD<P>
<UL>
    <LI> An Outstanding Success gives +1 to VCD; 
    <LI> A (regular) Success or Failure does not change VCD; 
    <li> A Catastrophic Failure gives -1 to VCD.  
</uL>
<P>
<HR>
 
<h3>Reenlistment</h3>

Vargr characters do <B>not</B> suffer the usual DM -2 when changing careers.
Instead, apply the number of points of VCD lost/gained within that term as
a DM penalty/bonus.  <P>
<HR>
 
<h3>Skills</h3>

<B>Luck (INT) - Determination </B><br>

This skill functions as per GDW's <cite>Dark Conspiracy</cite> and/or the article in
a back issue of <CITE>Traveller Chronicle</cite>.  Consider this skill to be TNE's
version of Jack-of-all-Trades.  <P>

<B>Observation<BR></B>

Remember that Vargr have better senses of smell and hearing than do
humans.  However, their sensitivity to color is not as acute as that of a
human (but they are not color-blind).  <P>

<B>Unarmed Martial Arts</B><BR>

In my campaign, this skill has the three cascades Block (for blocks and
evades), Strike (for punching and kicking), and Throw (for throws and
grapples).  Vargr have an additional cascade for this skill, called
Infighting.  This cascade <B>must</B> be the primary cascade for Vargr.  It
covers the use of a Vargr's claws and teeth. <p> 
<HR>
 
<h3>Default Skills</h3>

All Vargr have the default skills Leadership 0, Observation 0, and Unarmed
Martial Arts (Infighting) 0.  <P>
<HR>
