<H1>Cafadi</H1>

<H5>by James Maliszewski</H5>

</CENTER>

<HR><p>

<b>Homeworld</b>: Cafad (Corridor 3135 - E666554-6), an unbearably cold world.
Life on the surface is well-nigh impossible without technological aid. The
ancestors of the modern Cafadi lived in vast underground cave networks. Short
lifespans and conditions keep the population below 400,000.

<p> 
<h3>Physiology</h3>
<p>      The Cafadi are rather isolated and backwater people. As such, with less
interbreeding, describing their general physiological characteristics ia much
more easily done than for other human races.
<p>      <b> Height and weight</b>: Shorter than most humans, with males averaging a
height of only 1.6 meters tall. At 65 kg for either sex, weight is somewhat
greater than expected from their size. The extra weight comes from fatty
layers used as insulation against Cafad's terrible cold.
 <p>       <b>Appearance</b>: Short stature and stocky build gives Cafadi a squat
appearance. They have very light, almost albino skin tones. Hair color is
likewise very light, with blond and platinum hair predominating.
 <p>      Eye pupils are vertical slits rather than the normal circular shape. Eye
color tends toward green or hazel.
 <p>      The Cafadi head is shaped somewhat differently than other humans'. The
brow is much more sloped, although cranium size has not decreased. The result
is that the back of a Cafadi head juts out more. All in all, the Cafadi appear
very different from their fellow humans.
<p>      <b> Diet</b>: Omnivorous. All life on Cafad is digestible by humans without
special preparation.
<p>      There is little animal life underground, however. What little animal
life exists on Cafad is small, and the natives usually do not try to catch it.
They can, however, and have done so in the past.
  <p>    Diet staples are plants that grow in the warmer cave networks that exist
beneath the surface of Cafad. It is not known whether the life in Cafad's cave
networks is naturally evolved or specially placed there by the Ancients.
  <p>   <b> Rest</b>: Cafad's day is slightly more than 14 standard hours, but it has
little practical effect on life underground. The Cafadi developed time-keeping
systems independent of the local day. The Cafadi rest for ten hours, work for
ten hours, and finally rest for another ten hours, until they begin the cycle
anew. For Cafadi, the number three and its multiples (like 30) are very
important, as will be explained later.
 <p>    <b> Reproduction</b>: Females bear live children after a ten-month gestation
period. This longer pregnancy seems related to the generally small size of the
Cafadi: the child remains in the womb longer to develop enough to survive on
the outside. Multiple births are rare, but are not unheard of.
    The Cafadi are not interfertile with any human race other than their
own.
 <p>    <b> Senses</b>: Except for eyesight, Cafadi senses are equal to other humans'.
Their eyesight, however, is particularly keen in dim light. Night vision
allows them to see clearly in the dark for almost 10km. Bright light, however,
may temporarily blind them. Even when used to the higher light intensity, they
will squint and have difficulty with many ordinary tasks.
 <p>     <b>Anatomy</b>: Cafadi bones are thicker and broader to support the additional
weight they carry, while not gaining in height. Blood types are E, K, L, and S
with the dominant types being K and L.
     <b> Lifespan</b>: Short. Typical Cafadi live to between the ages of 55 and 60.

<h3>Psychology</h3>

  <p>    The inability of any life to survive for long on Cafad's surface
influences Cafadi psychology more than any other factor. The corollary, that
only the subterranean caverns with their geothermal heat sources maintained
life, also profoundly influences Cafadi world-view.
 <p>     First, Cafadi are not very inventive people. Early Cafadi attempted to
leave the heated caverns where they had been placed, to see what was outside.
Inhospitable snow and ice made further investigation and exploration seem
futile. Cafadi believe that investigating things beyond what is already known
can gain little or nothing. So why bother?
 <p>     Second, the directions of "up" and "above" (toward the surface) are
equated with evil and destruction. Cafadi religions describe hell as an ice-
cold region located above, while God resides in an eternally warm cave system
far under the ground. This has led to trouble understanding certain Solomani-
derived expressions concerning the nature of heaven and hell.
 <p>     Also, despite contact by other worlds, the Cafadi have no desire to
explore space. Space, an ice-cold realm where even oxygen must be supplied by
an outside device, comes as close to the Cafadi image of hell as anything.
<p>      Those few Cafadi who have left their homeworld, even about a nice warm
starship, became terrified by being surrounded by the cold vastness of space.
For some reason, they refused "cold sleep" of low berthing.
 <p>     Many Cafadi are agoraphobic, afraid of empty spaces. Even the cities
built on Cafad's surface -- with outside help -- exhibit a cramped, almost
cavernous structure. Open spaces and freedom of movement are not aspects of
Cafadi architecture.
<p>      Second, the ideas of freedom and liberty so central to many Solomani
philosophies mean little to the Cafadi. They believe each individual has a
role to play in society, and desire and inclination have no bearing on the
duty of filling that role.
 <p>     Doing an action because one should do it, not because one wishes to do
it, is the basis of Cafadi moral teaching. Freedom of action is held in low
esteem.

<p>
<hr><p>
<h3>Society and Culture</h3>

 <p>     Society is extremely harmonious: it has to be. The nature of the
underground cave systems necessitate that there be no dissent and that scarce
resources not be wasted on such things as investigation and exploration.
 <p>     A monarchial government arose naturally. The Cafadi king is a powerful
figure; his word means life or death to the 400,000 or so Cafadi who inhabit
his realm. The Cafadi moral system makes sure that a king (or queen - the
Cafadi are reasonably non-sexist in attitude) will do what must be done. A
static situation provides little scope for abuse of power.
 <p>     Culture emphasizes the well-known and proven theories of the past. Many
outsiders consider Cafadi culture to be antiquated, holding on to outdated
relics of the past. Interestingly, what technological advances the Cafadi did
make before the Long Night were due to Vilani, not Solomani, influence. The
Cafadi appear out-of-date even when compared to the conservative Vilani.
 <p>     Since the advent of the Third Imperium, the Cafadi have begun the slow
climb of technological advancement. They are now at pre-Stellar levels now,
because of Imperial aid and changing attitudes. Still, given their mindset and
their fear of space, it seems unlikely that they shall advance to higher
levels on technology anytime in the future.
<p>      The Cafadi are an artistic people. Their ancestors painted on the cave
walls, and that tradition continues unbroken. Generally speaking, these
paintings are sponsored by the government and depict events from the past of
Cafad. Their works serve a civic purpose: they do not really understand art
for art's sake.
 <p>     Cafadi are distrustful of strangers for many reasons. First, strangers
are always something new. In the past, one could count on every living soul
being beneath the surface: there were no outsiders. Second, outsiders tend to
deride and ridicule Cafadi ways. More than a few called the Cafadi
"neanderthal" or "troglodytes," referring to their underground ways and cave-
based culture. The Cafadi are sensitive to these attacks. Third, to the
Cafadi, outsiders come from what to them seems like hell. What can be expected
of gahati ("devils" or "demons")? Fourth, inability to interbreed with any
other race adds to a tendency for Cafadi to regard outsiders as somehow less
than fully "human."

<h3>Languages</h3>

 <p>     A numerically small population, the Cafadi spoke a common language early
on. It has many grammatical similarities with Galangic, and relies primarily
upon placement of words to determine their meaning. Speakers of both languages
find the structure similar enough that learning the other language is
primarily a matter of learning vocabulary and pronunciations. It is these
which are most difficult, however.

<p>
<hr><p>
<h3>Proverbs</h3>

  <p>    By learning something of the folk wisdom of the Cafadi, in the form of
their proverbs, one can learn much more than from any scholarly treatise on
Cafadi psychology and culture.
<ul>
       <i>Dagah goppatag cap tafod afappa.</i><br>
      Cold comes from the Devil.<br>
</ul>
      To the Cafadi, cold represents death and destruction.<p>

<ul>
      <i>Dohapof bogihap tafod aghot apogad cap cafad.</i><br>
      To obey is a man's highest obligation.<br>
</ul>
      Cafadi believe strongly in duty. It is the basis of their moral system.
One must obey because one is dutiful, not because one wishes to do so.<p>
<ul>
      <i>Purahod gat abbata dacad.</i><br>
      Look back to go forward.<br>
</ul>
      A conservative people, Cafadi believe that respect for the ways of the
past, not useless innovation, is the way to go forward into the future as a
stable society and culture.<p>

<h3>Character Generation (MegaTraveller Rules)</h3>


 <p>     For the most part, Cafadi humans are generated like other human
characters. Any differences are described here.
 <p>     Homeworld: the only possible homeworld for Cafadi characters is the
world Cafad in Corridor sector. The Cafad possess no extraplanetary colonies
and travel little beyond their homeworld.
 <p>     Initial Character Generation: The same basic characteristics used to
describe other humans are used for Cafadi. Generate characteristics normally
with 2D, but add one to the Strength and Endurance characteristics and
subtract one from Dexterity.
 <p>     Cafadi have both a given name and a surname. The given name comes first.
Some typical names are: Danahof, Capad, Gonadof and Tabad (for males) and
Agap, Abbofap, Ogcaf, and Ohotaf (for females).
 <p>     Cafadi society, like Imperial society, is feudal. Any Cafadi with a
Social Standing of B+ is a noble in Cafadi society. Very few, if any, Cafadi
would ever hold an Imperial patent of nobility, given the insular nature of
Cafadi society.
 <p>     Career types: Technically, a Cafadi could choose any of the usual career
types. Their introverted and conservative nature, however, makes many choices
unlikely, if not impossible. By normal Imperial standards, Cafadi are rather
limited in career choices.
 <p>     No Cafadi will serve in the Imperial military: any Cafadi who wishes a
military career is limited to either the small Cafadi army or planetary law
enforcement forces. Merchants restrict their activities to the surface of
their homeworld.
 <p>     Cafadi cannot become scientists, as any scientific advancement is slow
on Cafad. Scout, Belter, and Pirate are also impossible since they are space
careers.<p>
