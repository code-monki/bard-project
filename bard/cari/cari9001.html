	One minor alien race plays an important role in the Geonee Confederation.
Its homeworld, <a href="../opal/opal9505.html">Llyrn</a> (0931 D333AA7-A Na Po HiPop  933  F8 VI)  is a cold
world, a satellite of a gas giant orbiting a small star. It's upper crust is
full of huge natural caves. Life appeared on these caves around geothermal
energy sources, and most of the native life forms are subterranean,
cave-bound or tunnel-dwellers.<P>

	Life processes are mostly based on sulfur consumption for energy
production, leaving sulfur-rich waste products. The higher life forms in the
planet, such as the Llyrnians themselves, have in addition a secondary
metabolism which uses oxygen from the atmosphere to convert the waste
products back to organosilicates and sulfur. This latter process produces
SO<SUB>2</SUB gas as a waste, which is exhaled in order to cool the organism, and is
the reason of the typical brimstone smell of the Llyrnians.<P>

	The Llyrnians are based on a trilateral symmetry, with three "legs" on the
bottom part of a cylindrical "body" from which three "arms" spread. Three
"mouths" open under the arms for feeding purposes. The body is covered by a
tough external coat made of organosilicates, and the arms end in tough
claws. The Llyrnians dig the tunnels "upwards" using all three claws. They
are able to make the arms and claws vibrate in order to loose the rocks.<P>

	The main sensorial organs are three "ears" built into the arms, which give
Llyrnians a broad vibration-perception which makes them able to sense both
vibrations in the rocks in which the tunnels are drilled, and the faint
noises that are transmitted by the very thin atmosphere. Also, three
vibrating membranes on the upper part of the body give them a limited
"sonar" capability.<P>

	The body ends in a "head" which holds the secondary sensorial organs,
basically three breathing orifices which also function as smelling "noses"
and are able to produce noises for communication, and a visual band which
circles the whole head. The vision centers on the infrared part of the spectrum.<P>
		
	The Llyrnians biology is based on a triploid genetic system. They have
three sexes, usually referred to as "Warrior", "Delver", and "Feeder".
Feeders give birth to one or two newborns (almost always of the same sex)
after a gestation period of 112 standard days.<P>

	Genders are specialized. Warriors defend the community, Delvers build the
tunnels and Feeders take care of the children.<P>

	The average weight of a Llyrnian is 60 kilograms for Warriors and Delvers
and 80 for Feeders. The average height is 1.5 meters for the three sexes.<P>

	The Llyrnian society is built upon the community, a group ranging between a
few hundreds and ten thousand individuals of the three sexes. The community
leader, always a Delver, has almost absolute powers. The members of the
community instinctively accept its authority.<P>

	The measure of the power of a community is the extent of the tunnels and
caves it controls. So, Delvers are constantly planning new tunnels while
taking care of the stability of already settled ones, while Warriors
perpetually try to capture those belonging to rival communities, while
defending the own settlements.<P>

	The "tunnel fights" are ruthless battles fought in narrow, dark tunnels.
The Warriors rely heavily on their vibration perception, infrared vision and
their sonar sense during the fights.<P>

	The planet has been ruled as a whole by a central authority as long as
historical records exist. This central government takes the form of a
Charismatic Dictatorship in the person of the Supreme Delver, which is
designated by the previous one among the leaders of the most influential
communities. Succession takes place when the Supreme Delver reaches an
advanced age.<P>

	The Supreme Delver does not usually interfere with the fights between the
communities, as long as they do not evolve into large-scale wars through
alliances and coalitions of communities.<P>

<A NAME="History"><H3>History</H3></A>

	The Llyrnians were first contacted in year -9,070 by the neighboring
Geonee. Llyrn was then at TL 3, but the population had already exceeded the
one thousand millions figure.<P>

	The Geonee contacted Llyrn sporadically and helped the Llyrnians to upgrade
their technology, introducing heavy machinery which allowed the Delvers to
build larger and deeper tunnels. Over the following centuries, the Delvers
acquired more and more technical knowledge, and a population explosion occurred.<P>

	In -4,900, the Geonee were defeated by the Vilani and incorporated into the
Ziru Sirka. The Llyrnians, then at TL 7 in environment control and heavy
machinery, experienced a technological regression. Although they were
formally also incorporated into the Ziru Sirka, the few Vilani who ever
ventured into the tunnels never came back, and Llyrn was, for all practical
purposes, interdicted. Geonee historians speculate with the possibility that
some Geonee refugees spent their lives in Llyrn as technical advisors.<P>

	In -2,235, the Nth war between the Solomani and the Vilani made the Geonee
revolt against the Vilani. During the war, thousands of Llyrnians were used
by the Geonee as starship troopers, thanks to an agreement with the Supreme
Delver, in exchange for heavy machinery. The effectiveness of the Llyrnians
in boarding operations and infiltration operations was fearsome. Low-G
adapted and relying in vibration perception, infrared vision, and sonar, the
Llyrnian Warriors easily beat the humans in a fight on the corridors of a
boarded starship, when the light goes off and the artificial gravity fails.
In addition, the Llyrnians' vibrating claws easily drill big holes through
vacc suits, and have some possibility of breaking even combat armor. The
Geonee were able to capture hundreds of Vilani starships thanks to the
Llyrnian troops.<P>

	The Nth war started a tradition of using Llyrnian Warriors as Marines in
Geonee ships.<P>

	In -2,200, the Rule of Man created the Geonee Autonomous Region, which
included the Geonee worlds and Llyrn. Llyrn reached TL 8 and a population of
dozens of thousands of millions.<P>

	In -1,776, the Long Night started. Llyrn fell to TL5 in a few centuries,
but although most tunnels had to be abandoned when the environmental
controls failed, the planet managed to retain a population over ten thousand
of millions.<P>

	In -177, Llyrn was recontacted by the recently founded Second Geonee
Confederation. Geonee technical advisors and heavy machinery were once again
exchanged for Llyrnian Warriors.<P>

	A century later, the Geonee Confederation offered membership to Llyrn, but
the Supreme Delver declined the offer. Nevertheless, in -81, a full
Confederation Embassy was established at Llyrn, and, in year -73, a detailed
commercial treaty was signed. Llyrn slowly became a Client State of the
Geonee Confederation.<P>

	In Year Zero, Llyrn retains, from the commercial point of view, a heavy
dependence from the Geonee Confederation. At TL 10 and with an incredible
population in excess of ninety thousand of millions, the planet is an
excellent market for machinery and agroproducts. On the other hand, Llyrnian
Warriors can be found not only in the Geonee service, but also working for
other planets or corporations. And not only as starship troopers, but also
doing ground work in Low Gravity worlds, for example in Kiimda, the
conquered colony of the Geonee Confederation. Llyrnian Delvers also work in
several worlds with underground environments, for example in the Geonee
world of Dreva.<P>

	The commercial balance of Llyrn is only equilibrated thanks to the
long-term contracts of Warriors and Delvers out of Llyrn, all of which have
to be negotiated through the Supreme Delver or its representatives.<P>

      Llyrn (0931 D333978-9): Homeworld of the Llyrnian minor alien race.
The Llyrnians are tunnel-dwellers based on trilateral symmetry, whose main
sense is a broad range vibration perception. Of their three sexes (Feeders,
Delvers, and Warriors), the Warriors were traditionally contracted by other
races (specially the Geonee) as ship troops or marines. Used to low-G and
with a vision that centers in the infrared part of the spectrum, the
Llyrnians are fearsome in ship boarding actions.<P>

	During millennia, the dense network of tunnels of Llyrn's crust was under
the rule of a single leader, the Supreme Delver. When the Virus struck, most
of the deep tunnels, were abandoned, due to failure of the environmental
controls upon which its inhabitability depended. Roughly 25% of the tunnels,
though, were inhabitable without any environmental control. Unfortunately,
most of the major food production centers were located in the deepest
tunnels, and thousand of millions of survivors quickly died from starvation.
Adding insult to injury, the survivors of the Llyrnian race had to fight an
epic battle against the uncountable numbers of heavy robotized machines
which helped the Delvers to maintain the old tunnels and drill new ones. <P>
