</center><p>

For example, roll 1D6/2 +1D6 for a Sport's STR, roll 1D6+2 +1D6/2 for
a Sport's AGL, and so on.   <P>

As a result of career gains, an attribute can be raised, at most, two
points above the original value, but in no case above the racial maximum of
15 (F).  <P>

Instead of SOC, Droyne and Chirper characters have the pseudo-attribute
Caste (CST).  This attribute specifies the caste to which the character
belongs, and thus can never be changed once chosen.  Chirpers have CST 0,
Workers have CST 1, Warriors have CST 2, Drones have CST 3, Technicians
have CST 4, Sports have CST 5, and Leaders have CST 6.  <P>

<h3>Weight (actually, "Mass" :-)</h3>

The weight of a Chirper or a Droyne is 40+3x(STR-AGL) kilograms.  <p>

<h3>Default Skills</h3>

All Chirper and Droyne characters have Flying 0, Homing 0, Invisibility 0,
and Willpower 0.  Depending on the character's homeworld, the character
may also have the usual additional Default Skills (Computer 0, Pilot
(Grav) 0, Swimming 0, etc.).  <P>

<H3>Background Skills</h3>

A Chirper character can have whatever four appropriate Background Skills
the player wants, subject, as usual, to GM approval.  Droyne character have
specific Background Skills based on caste.  <P>

Service 2.<BR>

<h3>Career Generation and Resolution</h3>

Droyne and Chirpers begin career generation at age 12 (not 17), using the
standard four-year terms.  The number of skills they receive per term is
the usual for the term number. The following tables are for all terms. <P>

<h3>Money</h3>

Chirpers get just the basic amount for the homeworld Tech Level for each
term of service (i.e., as though they had a SOC of 1).  <P>

For Droyne, add together the character's rank number and the number of
terms served.  Multiply this number by the character's CST, and then
multiply this number by the basic amount for the homeworld Tech Level.  <P>

For example, a Sport of rank R2 from a High Stellar, after three terms of
service, would have Cr125,000 (2 + 3 = 5; 5 x 5 = 25; 25 x Cr5,000 =
Cr125,000).

This money is <b>not</b> available as cash.  Instead, the Droyne or
Chirper can have equipment whose total value doesn't exceed this monetary
amount.  <P>

<h3>Aging</h3>

Begin checking for losses of STR, AGL, and CON starting at age 20 (after
only two terms), and for losses of INT at age 52 (after 10 terms).  Sports
and Leaders receive a DM +3.  <P>

<h3>Unusal Skills</h3>

Droyne and Chirpers almost never have the skills Bribery, Forgery,
Gambling, and Streetwise.  <P>

<h3>New Skills</h3>

<b>Deduction/Analysis (INT) -- Perception</b>:
This skill allows a character to piece together facts into a related
whole.  This skill is a combination of the skill Deduction from a back
issue of <i>The Traveller Chronicle</i> [TTC] and the skill Intelligence
Analysis presented a while ago on the TML by someone else.  <P>

<b>Flying (CON) -- Acrobat, Personal Transport</b>:
This skill lets the Droyne or Chirper make use of mechanical wings.  This
skill is from <i>Alien Module 5: Droyne</i> [AM5:Dr].  <P>

<b>Homing (PSI) -- Clairsentience/Teleperception</b>:
This psionic Talent lets the Droyne or Chirper find its way back to its
community.  This Talent is from <i>AM5:Dr</i>.  <P>

<b>Invisibility (PSI) -- Telepathy/Telereception</b>:
This psionic Talent allows the Droyne or Chirper to cloud the minds of
men (evil chuckle not included).  This Talent is from <i>AM5:Dr</i>.  <P>

<b>Luck (INT) -- Determination</b>:
This skill is from a back issue of <i>TTC</i> (the same one as Deduction,
above), as well as from GDW's <i>Dark Conspiracy</i>.  This skill acts as
TNE's version of Jack-Of-All-Trades.  <P>

<b>Philosophy/Theology (EDU) -- Social Science</b>:
This skill is used by Droyne for their <i>coyn</I>-casting ceremonies.
This skill is otherwise identical to the version presented in T4.  It is
used instead of the new skill Prediction from <i>AM5:Dr</i>.  <P>

<h3>Modified Skills</h3>

<b>Liaison</b>:
This skill is used by Droyne as normal.  It's also used to cross caste
barriers, instead of using the "new" skill Appeal from <i>AM5:Dr</i>.  <P>
