   Smaetal Swarms.  Populary known as 'smarts', minnies, and pirhana bugs,
  are an extreamly small, flying life form native to Smaeta, near the Imperial
  core, but now found infrequantly on countless humid, tropical environments
  on worlds across the Imperium.
    <P>
   Each adult smeat weighs less than .1 gram, and has a wingspan of less than
  1 cm. They are generally encountered as an upright, pillar-shaped cloud,
  about 2 m tall, which drifts along just above the ground. One cloud may
  contain 50k individuals.
    <P>
   Smaets have a rather complicated reproductive cycle. The eggs, which are
  laid by the thousands on unripe fruit, seem to mature and develope as the
  fruit ripens, drawing on the fruit's internal chemistry in some fation.
  Various methods of ripening of the fruit seem only to delay the maturation
  of the eggs. When the eggs hatch, the tiny winged reproductive phase of the
  creature burrows out, and joins the local, rapidly growing swarm.
    <P>
   Smeats are carnivores. The cloud will approch any homeothermic life form
  of more than 50 kg mass at the speed of a man's run. A single bite is no
  more than an annoying pinprick, but thousands of bites in the space of a few
  moments can be deadly, and smaets are classified as dangerious life forms.
    <P>
   Attacks by a smaetal swarm causes 2D damage per turn. Individule roll are
  made against every character which occupies the same area as the swarm. They
  can be avoided by jumping into water or running through fire or thick smoke.
  Torches confuse them. Though they will attack a man carrying a torch or
  burning brand, they will inflict only 1D damage per turn. Each turn, the
  character may throw 2D to see if the torch breaks up the swarm long enough
  for the characters to escape (throw 9+ to do so). Smaets can pursue a human
  as fast as he can run, and for al long.
    <P>
   Persons partially protected by armor suffer only 1D damage points each
  round they are attacked, but most types of armor will not completely protect
  an individual. Only characters in compleately self-contained environments
  (vacc suits, combat armor, battle dress, or sealed combat environment suits)
  will be compleately safe from smaetal attacks. But they may suffer accidents
  due to vision imparement.
  <P>
   Unfortunatly, those weapons best able to disperse a swarm (gernades, wide
  beam plasma guns, flame throwers and the like) are inappropriate for use
  within the confines of a starship hold or starship terminal. Vacuume, jets
  of water, or blast from CO^2 fire extinguishers have been known to control
  them in close quarters. The eggs have thus far proven immune to all common
  ovicidal techniques, including fumigation and irradiation.
