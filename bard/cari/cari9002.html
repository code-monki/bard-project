<A NAME="Overview"><H3>Overview</H3></A>
The Brinn are one of the most unusual races known to scientists of the Third
Imperium: they are descended from carnivore/killer stock. Among the hundreds
of sophont species known to humaniti, only a handful can lay claim to a
similar heritage.<p>
<hr>
<A NAME="Desc"><H3>Description</H3></A>
Physically, the Brinn are a very large race, with adults massing an average
of 1,250 kilograms each. In appearance, they look something like Terran
crabs or spiders, but having ten limbs.<p>

As in a spider, the limbs are angled upward as they leave the body and then
turn back down toward the ground after the joint. The Brinn limbs are much
thicker in proportion to the body than those of Terran arachnids. The six
hindmost limbs are used for locomotion. Each of these ends in a strong set
of six grasping claws. While useless in combat, they provide excellent
traction on the rough terrain amid which the Brinn evolved.<p>

The leading four limbs are manipulatory. The first pair of arms are slender
and terminate in manipulatory hands, each of which is made up of four
fingers and two thumbs. These are similar enough to human hands to permit
the use of many pieces of human equipment without modification or unusual
difficulty. The remnants of claws can still be found on the fingers and
thumbs, but these serve no purpose .<p>

The second set of limbs is heavier than the first and ends in a trio of
sharp talons. In melee combat, these are the primary weapons of the Brinn.
The talons are quite sharp and the great strength of the arms renders them
deadly.<p>

The body of a Brinn is not hard like that of a spider, but is covered with a
tough, leathery, black skin. The brain is at the center of the body,
surrounded by a protective bone case. Two major nerve stalks, known as the
dorsal and ventral columns, leave the brain and run to clusters of sensory
organs on the back and belly.<p>

A large bump, known as the dorsal sense cluster, rises from the center of
the back, and serves as the primary sensory organ. It has six eyes located
around it which provide the Brinn with a full 3600 field of vision. Brinn
eyesight is far more sensitive to infrared radiation than that of the
average human, but is very limited in the so-called "visible spectrum". In
fact, Brinn are wholly unable to perceive many higher-frequency colors, such
as green, blue, and violet.<p>

Also located in the dorsal cluster is the intake for the Brinn respiratory
system. Air is drawn in through an opening atop the cluster and into the
creature's lungs. Here, the vital methane is extracted and passed into the
blood stream for distribution about the body. Also, the dry air is filtered
for any traces of liquid (mainly hydrogen cyanide) which the body needs to
survive. In this manner, the Brinn are able to survive on a world with
almost no hydrosphere.<p>

Lastly, the dorsal cluster contains the Binn's sense of smell. Air which is
headed for the lungs passes along several membranes which sample it for
trace elements in a manner not unlike that of a human olfactory system. The
Brinn sense of smell, however, is not very acute.<p>

On the underside of the Brinn is a smaller group of sensory organs, the
ventral sense cluster. A small set of photosensitive spots encircles it, but
these provide only a general sense of light and dark. In practice, the Brinn
all but ignore the input from these "eyes".<p>

Of far greater interest is the vibrational sensor, which makes up the outer
surface of the cluster. While similar in some ways to a human ear, it is far
less sensitive in the air. But when placed against the ground, it becomes an
important sense organ. Except for the faint impressions of sound which the
vibrational sensor can pick up, Brinn are deaf.<p>

Prior to their evolution of intelligence, the Brinn hunted by hollowing out
areas beneath the surface of the planet and waiting for prey to pass by.
When the vibrations in the ground about them indicated that a creature was
passing above their dwelling, they would spring out and strike in a manner
which has been likened to that of a trap-door spider on Terra.<p>
<hr>

<A NAME="repo"><H3>Reproduction</H3></A>
Being methane breathers who find temperatures of -600 to be uncomfortably
warm, the Brinn are not typical of the ranks of Imperial citizens. When one
takes into account the fact that they have four sexes instead of the far
more common two, they become even more unusual. Three of the four sexes are
treated with complete equality in Brinn society, which judges all of its
adult citizens by their physical and mental fitness alone; the fourth sex
consists of the young only and are given a status roughly equal to that of
non-adults in most cultures.<p>

Nulls, the first of the sexes, are actually just Brinn children who have not
yet attained maturity. From birth until the age of about nine standard
years, all Brinn are nulls. It is impossible to tell which sex a child will
be when it matures until the change actually occurs. All nulls are dark grey
in color.<p>

As the young near what the Brinn call the 'time of progression", they become
lethargic and listless. At this point, they must decide which sex they will
assume as adults. All evidence collected by Imperial scientists to date
indicates that the change is totally up to the individual. Once the choice
is made, the youth enters a state of hibernation which is very near death
and the body begins to alter itself. After seven to 12 days, the changes are
complete and the Brinn awakes as a fully mature adult.
Males, the second of the four sexes, are off-white or light grey in color.
In reproduction, the males supply the sperm which fertilizes the eggs and
allows them to begin growth.<p>

Alpha-females (often called simply "alphas" or "alphafems") are the egg
producers. They are black or dark grey in color and tend to be somewhat
smaller that the other sexes, averaging only 1,200 kilograms in mass.
Beta-females (often called simply "betas" or "beta-fems") receive both the
sperm and the egg from their mates and store them in their bodies until the
eggs mature enough to survive on their own. This takes an average of three
months. Once the egg can survive on its own, it is expelled from the beta's
body and placed in a nursery area which provides incubation for all of the
eggs in a given community. After another two and a half to three months, the
egg hatches and the child is born. Betas are light grey on their dorsal
surfaces, fading to black on the underside.<p>
<hr>
<A NAME="back"><H3>Background</H3></A>

During the Vilani expansions which lead to the eventual founding of the
First Imperium, explorers came across the Kateri system and its unusual
natives. At that point, the Brinn had only just begun to mount a manned
space program and reach out to the worlds around them.
Vilani traders opened negotiations and soon began to develop a mutually
beneficial platform of exchanges and economic intercourse. When the Ziru
Sirka (or "Grand Empire of Stars") was established in -4045, the Brinn were
eager to accept membership.<p>

With the help of the First Imperium, the Brinn quickly established a
systemwide society that thrived on the exploitation of its asteroid belts
and jovian worlds. Under the beneficent rule of the Vilani, the Brinn
culture prospered and grew.
In -2207, shortly after the advent of the Rule of Man, things began to
change for the Brinn. Their good relations with the Ziru Sirka government
did not carry much weight when the Solomani took power. After a series of
military exchanges, which went largely against the Brinn, the Kateri system
fell. The Solomain quickly established a military government to keep the
natives under control. Brinn culture began a stagnation that was to last for
almost 3,000 years.<p>

The next five centuries saw the rape of the Kateri system and the violent
subjugation of its people. Almost without fail, the military rulers
appointed by Terra were despots and tyrants. The few exceptions made no
change in the deteriorating state of Brinn-human relations.
With the passing of the Rule of Man and the onset of the Long Night, the
Brinn managed to drive humaniti from their system. Long forgotten was the
kindness and co-operation which had existed between the Brinn and the First
Imperium. Now, humaniti was remembered only as a race of sadistic slave
masters and economic pirates.<p>

As the Long Night ground on, the Brinn expanded their society and moved
outward from their system. When the Terran dictators were driven out of the
Kateri system, the Brinn captured much of their equipment and were able to
assemble a formidable space fleet.
One by one, human settlements in neighboring systems were located and
attacked. In a matter of years, the Brinn overran three nearby worlds and
instituted a policy of genocide unmatched by any other known civilization.
<p>
Because the Brinn find the environment of the worlds on which mankind
settles inhospitable, they rarely engaged in long and costly ground battles
for control of a system. Once the defending space fleet of a human system
was overcome, the Brinn simply began to bombard it from orbit.
<p>
The attacks were horrible and effective. Small asteroids were diverted to
fall atop major cities and nuclear weapons were employed without concern for
the ecological havoc which they would bring to the worlds . The Brinn did
not wish to enslave the humans they found, only to destroy them.
<p>
For nearly a hundred years, the Brinn expanded outward. As they moved, they
brought death to numerous human worlds and outposts. However, the endless
warfare cost them heavily.
<p>
The starships which they had claimed from the fallen Second Imperium began
to fail beyond repair. While the Brinn could maintain starships, they could
not build them. Centuries later when Cleon Zhunastu began his campaigns to
forge the Third Imperium, the human cultures around
the Brinn had united against them and driven them back into their home
system.<p>

The Pacification Campaigns (76-120) forced the Brinn, via military actions,
to join the Third Imperium. For the second time in their history, the Brinn
found themselves under the hand of an unwelcome human government. Economic
and political programs established under the rulership of the Lentuli
dynasty were little more than vengeance for the Brinn's genocidal campaigns
during the Long Night.
As the turmoil of the Civil War shook the foundations of Imperial control in
the 600s, the Brinn attempted to throw off their human masters in a violent
but unsuccessful rebellion. Although they did manage to reclaim their own
system, they were unable to hold it against the subsequent counterstrikes
which quickly decimated their makeshift war fleet.<p>

When the Imperium regained control of Kateri less than a year later, it was
found that the Brinn had once again embarked on a program of genocidal
warfare against humaniti. Every single human being who had been trapped in
the system when the Imperial troops were forced to withdraw had been slain
by the Brinn.<p>

After the fires of the Civil War had cooled, the Brinn were once again
subject to retribution for their actions. Although
an official policy of Imperial Absolution was granted by Arbellatra for all
military actions fought in the course of the Civil War, the Brinn were
returned to a state of military rule and forced to accept unusually harsh
socio-economic restrictions again.
Early on in the rule of Strephon, the Imperial Military Government of the
Kateri system was ordered to assist the natives in the formation of a
civilian government. After ten years of negotiations and political
arbitration, the Brinn established a civil service bureaucracy to govern the
planet.<p>

Despite their new liberties, the Brinn are still almost wholly under the
thumb of the Imperial Military. Every new ruling made by the government has
to be cleared by the military before implementation, and the Brinn are
forbidden to raise any form of military other than a local system police
force.<p>

<hr>
<A NAME="home"><H3>Brinn Homeworld</H3></A>

The Brinn homeworld, Divad, circles around the main sequence M5 star Kateri
in the Corridor sector, By astronomical standards, it is a very unimpressive
star and was not considered a likely candidate for life-bearing worlds prior
to its exploration by Vilani scouts in -4576.
Kateri has an absolute bolometric magnitude of 10.2 and a luminosity of only
0.007, making it much fainter and weaker than Sol. It is roughly one-third
the size and mass of Terra's star and has a surface temperature of only
2,8000 K. There are five orbits about the star which are occupied.
<p>
The innermost orbit, at a distance of roughly 15 million kilometers (0.1
AU), is filled by an unusually dense ring of asteroids. When the Brinn first
began to explore their system (less than fifty years before their first
contact with humaniti) they found a treasure trove of ores in these rocks.
To this day, a population of almost 35,000 prospectors works amid these
mineral-rich planetoids.<p>

The third and fourth orbits, at 0.32 and 0.48 AU, are occupied by jovian
worlds similar to Assiniboia in the Regina system or Jupiter in the Terra
system. The innermost of these two is 150,000 kilometers in diameter and has
been named Kleslin in Galanglic. It has 11 major moons, five of which are
currently home to various Brinn installations, and a pronounced ring of ice.
<p>
The outer of the two gas giants is Galidesh, and is only half the size of
its sister world. It has only 6 major moons, two of which are occupied by
the Brinn. Although Galidesh has its own ring system, it is much fainter and
far less spectacular than that of Kleslin.
The farthest occupied orbit in the Kateri system is 0.72 AUs from the star.
Like the inner most orbit, it is home to an asteroid belt. This one, unlike
the first, is sparse and geologically average. It has seen some exploitation
by the Brinn during their history, but is normally home to fewer than 5,000
prospectors at any given time,
<p>
In the second orbital position, at a distance of 0.2 AUs, is the Brinn
homeworld, Divad. In human terms, a less hospitable world would be hard to
find. If it were not for the need to oversee the native race, it is doubtful
that the Imperium would ever established any form of colony or outpost here.
<p>
Divad is 13,120 kilometers in diameter with a rocky core. Its density is
only 0.76, giving it a mass of 0.82 standard and a surface gravity of only
0.78 gees. Divad turns on its axis every 36.7 hours and circles Kateri every
12.28 local days (18.78 standard days). Divad's axial tilt is 16", while its
orbital eccentricity is 0.02. Divad has no moons.
The atmosphere which shrouds Divad is a mixture of hydrogen (70%) and
methane (28%). The remaining 2% is made up of various elements which are
non-toxic to the Brinn, but quite deadly to humans. The atmospheric pressure
is 1.9 standard.
There is very little precipitation on the world and only 4.7% of the surface
is covered by liquid. In almost all cases, this is hydrogen cyanide which,
although vital to Brinn metabolism, is quickly lethal to humans (and most
other oxygen-breathing races known to the Imperium).
Because Kateri is such a weak star, Divad is a cold world despite its close
proximity. On the average, the surface temperature is almost -1000 C. On the
poles, this can fall to as low as -170*. Regions near the equator have been
known to reach temperatures of -550 during the height of summer,
<p>
Unlike worlds with molten cores, Davao's crust is not broken into multiple
tectonic plates. In fact, geologically it is quite stable and has been for a
very long time.
<p>
<hr>
<A NAME="enviro"><H3>Divad's Environment</H3></A>

The climate on Divad is, to say the least, hostile to human inhabitants. In
order to overcome the environment and make the presence of the military
government practical, Imperial engineers have constructed a vast complex of
selfcontained structures on and below the surface of Divad. There are
several things to consider when examining the hazards of human settlement on
this world.<p>

As the atmospheric pressure on Divad is greater (in most cases) than that
found within human inhabited facilities, most leaks involve the
contamination of a standard oxygennitrogen atmosphere inside by the
methane-hydrogen mixture outside. On rare occasions, the opposite exchange
occurs and a quantity of terrestrial air is released into the Brinn
environment.<p>

In both cases, the results are almost instantly hazardous. Both hydrogen and
methane, the two primary components of a standard Brinn atmosphere, can
combine explosively with the oxygen found in a conventional human
environment. Once the contamination reaches a sufficient level, the
slightest spark can set off a powerful explosion which may injure or kill
those in the area.<p>

In additiun to the risk of detonation, there is the danger of toxins in the
area of an air leak. To humaniti, the trace of hydrogen cyanide found in the
atmosphere of Divad quickly causes unconsciousness and death. Likewise, the
oxygen in a normal human's air supply is deadly to the Brinn, though to a
lesser extent.<p>

Although the two major components of Divad's atmosphere are both odorless
and colorless to human perceptions, there are trace elements which are quite
noticeable. Humans who have been fortunate enough to inhale traces of the
outside air and survive agree that it smells like very bitter lemon with a
hint of almost sickly sweet almond. The Brinn say that our atmosphere smells
like "a thing long dead which has been pulled from the belly of a predator".
<p>
Another concern of the non-Brinn inhabitants of Divad is the danger of
diffusion. The hydrogen in the atmosphere is able to seep through many
standard materials even without a break in the integrity of an environmental
seal. Although diffusion does not pose the threat of poisoning those who
breathe it, it can still reach flammable levels in time. The enire human
settlement on Divad is sealed against hydrogen diffusion, so it is not
normally a problem. Those who leave he main settlements and in small
vehicles or vacc suits should remember to take precautions, however.
<p>
One must also take into account the low average temperature on Divad. In the
city of B'Rel'Lhas, where the Imperial presence is most pronounced, the
average temperature is almost -1000 C. This has made the continuous
operation of heating systems vital in areas which are used by humaniti. Even
a small failure brings temperatures dangerously low in a brief period of
time.
In order to counter both the hazard of environmental leaks and heating
failures, every area of the Imperial Complex in B'Rel'Lhas is linked to a
computer monitoring system which constantly tests the environment in the
facility and sounds an alarm in the event of a malfunction or other hazard.
Dangerous areas are evacuated (it possible) and then quickly sealed off.
<p>
<hr>
<A NAME="gov"><H3>Government</H3></A>

Divad is ruled by a civil service bureaucracy known as the Grand Dominion.
Under Imperial guidance and control, the Dominion has been restoring a
limited form of self-rule to the Brinn after centuries under a military
government imposed by the Imperium.<p>

The Dominion is made up of over three dozen councils, each of which is
charged with the control of one area of society. The more important councils
are those of Wealth (economics), Truth (religion), Knowledge (education),
and Service (public welfare). Each of these is composed of 15 members (known
as Dominators) who are grouped into three internal councils, approximating
the functions of the judicial, legislative, and executive branches.
<p>
For example, the Council of Wealth is wholly in control of the Dominion's
economy. Five of its members set down the laws which govern society in such
matters, another group controls those portions of the planetary police force
which enforces those laws, and the last team of Dominators passes judgment
and hands out punishments to violaters.<p>

Members of the various councils are selected by the Grand Council of
Dominators. This group is made up of the senior members from each of the
various ruling councils and serves no function other than to select
replacements for those who die or retire from government office.
<p>
The Grand Council also has the power to decide that Dominators are unfit to
continue in office; it can order them removed from government. The head of
the Grand Council is the Grand Dominator (the senior member of the group)
and it is he who adjudicates all ties in the council's decisions.
<p>
The nature of this arrangement is such that older, more conservative members
of the government tend to be in posittion of greater power than younger,
usually more liberal, citizens. The overall result is that the Grand
Dominion is somewhat resistant to large scale changes in governmental or
social programs and generally supports the status quo.
<p>
<hr>
<A NAME="council"><H3>Council of Valor</H3></A>

Under the terms of the military occupation of Divad and the Kateri system,
the Brinn were not permitted to raise any than law enforcers. For centuries,
form of military  other however, a guerrilla war had been waged against the
Imperium by groups of terrorists. This group was known, among the Brinn, as
the Council of Valor.<p>

Although their actions have not posed a serious threat to the Imperial
forces in Kateri since the first Civil War (604-622), they have served to
remind the citizens of Divad that they are under the hand of a human
government.<p>

As soon as their long sought-after revolution came and the Imperium was
forced to leave the system to the Brinn, the Council of Valor took its place
among the other branches of the Grand Dominion.
<p>
<hr>
<A NAME="lan"><H3>Language</H3></A>

Being almost totally deaf by human standards, the Brinn have no spoken
language. In its place, they have developed a communication system which is
based on vibrations induced in the ground beneath them.
<p>
Two Brinn converse by settling upon their ventral clusters, bringing their
vibrational sensors into contact with the surface below them, and then
thrumming the ground with their powerful legs. Words and concepts are
expressed by the number and duration of vibrations (in a manner similar to
Morse code) while emotion is imparted by the intensity.
<p>
As might be imagined, two Brinn having a heated argument can engage in a
great deal of stomping and pounding. In many cases, the evidence of a past
conversation (deep foot prints, broken stones, and damage to the ground
beneath them) may be obvious for several days.
<p>
<hr>
<A NAME="religon"><H3>Religon</H3></A>

The Brinn have developed a most unusual religious belief which dominates
their lives in many ways and which is almost universally accepted amongst
the citizenry. The roots of their beliefs can be traced back to the time
shortly after the militant Solomani came to their system.
<p>
During this time, as the past glory of the First Imperium was quickly being
bled away by the parasitic takeover of the Solomani, the existing
<p>
Brinn religions began to lose popular support and falter. In less than a
century, nearly every previously existing faith was in ashes, replaced by
what is now simply known as the Truth.
In short, the Truth states that the Brinn (and all other lifeforms) were
created by a single divine being of a universally unfathomable nature. This
entity, known as H'Tykk'Ral, is cruel and slightly sadistic. The Brinn point
to their own suffering over the last three millenia as evidence of this
claim.<p>

The reason for this unabashed hostility toward his offspring is obvious (to
the believers): H'Tykk'Ral is testing his peoples. Those who cannot answer
his puzzles and face his challenges are not worthy of ascent and evolution.
<p>
The Brinn believe that it is their purpose to rise up against their deity
one day and confront him in the Great Conflict. If they are able to defeat
him, and thus escape the tortures and torments which all who live in this
universe must endlessly endure, they will assume his role as masters of the
cosmos. With this in mind, individual Brinn work constantly to perfect
themselves mentally and physically.
<p>
Their view of humaniti is greatly tinted by the Truth. They see all other
lifeforms, but most obviously mankind, as competitors who must be overcome
in the course of their struggles toward the final battle with H'Tykk'Ral.
The fact that the Imperium is so far ahead of them in technology indicates
that they are nearer to the Great Conflict than the Brinn. The Truth
encourages them to believe that victory over so superior a foe as humaniti
would be greatly valuable in their preparations for the coming confrontation
with H'Tykk'Ral.<p>

The Truth is so much a part of the day-to-day life of the Brinn citizenry
that they have no special churches or temples for religious services. All
believers are expected to carefully cultivate the rage which they feel for
H'Tykk'Ral and for the hostile way in which he has treated them.
<p>


The Brinn do not pray to H'Tykk'Ral in any conventional way, but rather,
offer him threats and promises of defeat in the Great Conflict. It is not
unusual for a Brinn in a desperate situation to make statements which,
roughly translated, mean "This is another insult to my race which must be
avenged" or, as the Imperials on Divad often joke, "That's another one I owe
you, God".<p>

The Second Grand Survey, published in 1065 by the Imperial Interstellar
Scout Service, listed the religion of the Brinn as having a Universal
Religious Profile of 9130992-8.<p>

<hr>
<A NAME="rea"><H3>R'Earst'Ahlann</H3></A>

One of the most unusual aspects of the Truth is the practice of
R'Earst'Ahlann or the Great Tribute. As a part of their struggle to win
liberation from the cruel hand of their deity, the Brinn feel that it is
important to understand their enemies. Their religion states that the best
way to do this is to "assume the thoughts of the competitor". This is done,
quite simply, by eating the brain of a worthy foe.<p>

It should be noted that the Brinn are not simply monsters with an unending
hunger for brains, as many stories of battles with them might indicate, and
that the process is not commonly invoked on humans. When it is done,
however, R'Earst'Ahlann is considered to be the finest compliment which one
can pay to an enemy.<p>

The Brinn have a saying which, when translated, goes something like this :
"I will savor the taste of your thoughts and learn from this diet of your
flesh". These words, or others to the same effect, are often "spoken" to a
respected enemy prior to his death as a sign of respect.<p>

One of the foremost reasons for the rarity of R'Earst'Ahlann in battles
against humaniti is simple medicine: human beings (and their brains) are
quite toxic to the Brinn. Hence, when the Great Tribute is to be paid to a
human (or similar) foe, the Brinn is placing his own life in grave danger.
<p>
Only the closest of medical supervision and the injections of massive doses
of anti-toxins can make the ritual fairly safe.<p>

<hr>
<A NAME="complex"><H3>The Imperial Complex</H3></A>

The vast majority of Imperials who dwell on or visit Divad spend virtually
all of their time in the Imperial Complex. This city-sized complex is sealed
off from the outside environment and isolates its two million inhabitants
from the hostile world on which they live.<p>

Much of the complex has been constructed beneath the surface, with only the
starport and portions of the Imperial military installations found above
ground. Underground are the normal bureaucratic offices of the Complex,
housing for both military and civilian inhabitants, as well as a small
complement of shops, theaters, and similar recreational areas.<p>

Due to the vastly different environments which human and Brinn inhabitants
find comfortable, direct contact between the two races has always been
limited. The military situation on Divad has not helped matters, and many of
the humans who live there have never seen a Brinn in person.
<p>
Only recently, with the theoretical return of the system to civilian rule,
have Brinn been allowed to enter the Imperial Complex. When inside, they
must wear bulky environmental suits to protect them from the terrestrial
temperature and atmosphere. Over the last few years, a few of them have
taken up residence within the Complex, in areas sealed off from the rest of
the facility, to work more closely with humans.
<p>
Smaller but similar Imperial settlements exist in the cities of THoris'An
and V'Hol'Dahl. Each of them has a population which is roughly half that of
the Imperial Complex at B'Rel'Lhas.
<p>
<hr>
<A NAME="rebellion"><H3>During the Rebellion</H3></A>

As word of the assassination of Strephon and the fragmentation of the
Imperial Core reached Divad, the Brinn resistance units launched a massive
campaign of propaganda and guerrilla warfare against the Imperial personnel
on their world. Almost at once, riots broke out in the major cities and the
masses turned on the Imperial military forces stationed in the Kateri
system. In the first night, rebel forces were able to take control of the
planet's starport at B'Rel'Lhas and cut off many Imperial citizens who were
trying to escape the impending revolution.<p>

As soon as the area was secured, the Brinn began to slaughter their captives
under orders given to them by the Council of Truth. Their liberation was at
hand and the oxygen breathers would be destroyed at last. Whenever and
wherever they were found, non-Brinn were put to death quickly.<p>

Over the course of the next ten years, during which the civil war was at its
height, the Brinn stayed within their system and built up a military force.
Outside, the shattered Imperium did its best to commit suicide and paid
little attention to the loss of the Brinn system. It was a fatal mistake.
<p>
The Brinn moved out of the Kateri system quickly and struck at nearby human
worlds. Once again, their tactics were simple and effective. Whole cities
were incinerated by thermonuclear weapons and billions of people were slain
in the initial attacks. The majority of those who survived the first
onslaught fell victim to the ecological collapses brought on by extensive
radiation exposure and the blocking of sunlight by the gigatons of dust
which suddenly filled the upper atmospheres.<p>

Currently, the Brinn occupy a group of six star systems in the rimward
