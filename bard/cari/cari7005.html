The Domain of Deneb had psionic facilities at
Wypoc/Lanth and Vanejen/Rhylanor, as per MT Imperial
Encyclopedia.  Since the Psionic Reforms of course,
most major Regency worlds have psionic institutes, and
the Regency military has open psionic training
programs.
<P>
A great deal of this training was intended to deter
Zhodani intelligence gathering, and to allow a means
of infiltrating the Consulate.  The former was quite
successful. Espionage against the Consulate was much
more difficult, since Zhodani proles were conditioned
to recognise "aberrant" behavior among their fellows,
in support of the Tavrchedl. To simply have psionics
wasn't enough, as suspicious proles could tip off the
authorities.  In addition, civilian movements were
carefully monitered, and information carefully
filtered for content, further upsetting intel
gathering.  For the most part INI and its sisters
relied upon a network of remote sensors like Longbow,
Zho defectors, and Zhodani subject species spies and
even a few Vargr "corsairs" to gather intel.
<P>
Its not that the Regency government is at all suprised
at the problems of their neighbor: Strephon himself
had given them the Longbow data, and Norris had taken
that as a suggestion that the Consulate had to be
watched very carefully.  Moreover, the Consulate
admitted to Norris in 1131 that it had "a few
problems" (the Empress Wave not being one of those
mentioned).  But they stiffarmed Regency emissaries on
the details.  And for a number of political and
diplomatic reasons, the Regency did not press them.
Nor did it undertake extraordinary intelligence
precautions, other than erecting a mini-Longbow at
Pixie/Regina, and in Far Frontiers Sector within the
borders of the allied Protectorate.
<P>
The Regency did have indirect intelligence about
conditions in the Consulate, but they never acted upon
the information they recieved, for a number of
reasons.<P>
First of all, the Regency couldn't do anything for the
Consulate. The Regency was only a Domain in size, the
Zhodani had 5,000 systems.  And the delicate
diplomatic balance required to maintain the Quarantine
meant that the Regency needed to keep its material and
manpower at home to deter other powers.  The Regency
determined in a threat analysis early in the 1130s
that a Zhodani Collapse was a worst case possibility,
and no one, even Norris, wanted to contemplate that.
<P>
Second, people in crisis conditions have their hands
full with reality, and tend to minimise possibilities
of a darker nature. The Regency needed the existence
of the Consulate as a backstop for their own
resistance, and were quite willing to ignore contrary
evidence, and even desecrate the memory of the
Imperium in order to create a smooth partnership.
<P>
Thirdly, the Regency knew that the Zho problems were
connected to the Empress Wave, but explaining one
would entail explaining the other, which would entail
explaining to everyone why the Regency government
hasn't explained anything at all.
<P>
Fourth, the Consulate didn't want any help, and
attempted to deny it had a problem up until 1190. As
it is, the Regency still hasn't gotten any diplomatic
notification of ANYTHING since the Exodus began.
