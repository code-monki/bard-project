<H1>Ayansh'i Character Generation</H1>

<H5>by <A HREF="../../credits.html#Stanley">Derek Stanley</A></H5>

<HR>


	There are a number of changes in the character generation system which
must be observed when generating an Ayanshi character.  The following
Stat modifiers are applied to all Ayanshi Characters:  STR -2, AGL +2,
CON +1, EDU -2, PSI +1.  This may seem excessive but these modifiers
include both the Planetary and Racial modifications.  All Ayanshi
characters are aware of their Psionic ability.<P>
	On the Background Skills List on page 23, for any skill included the
Cascade, Fine Arts one background option point counts as 3 skill levels
in that skill.  All Ayanshi characters begin the game with Willpower 1
and the Psionic Skills, Suspended Animation 1 and Shield 1.  As a
compensation for this, Ayanshi never begin character generation before
the age of 22.<P>
	Aging Effects are something far more difficult to deal with.  Due to
the inordinate length of the Ayanshi life-span the effects of aging
rarely begin to effect the character before the age of 200.  What this
means is an Ayanshi character could serve upwards of 45 terms before
beginning to age, you can imagine the types of characters that would
appear.  <P>
	To remedy this problem and keep things within the spirit of the game
all Ayanshi characters must roll a d10 vs. their current term if the
die roll is less than or equal to that number the character precipitates
out into the game.  (i.e. after 5 terms if the character rolls 5 or less
the game begins.)<P>
	Only during the characters final term may careers with a tech level of
9+ be selected.  The only exception to this rule is if characters wish
to join CNERS in which case two TL9+ careers can be taken.<P>

<h3>Special Ayanshi Careers.</H3>

<B>Artisan</B>:
	There are few people on Eralaka as respected as its artists and there
were few artists in the Old Imperium as respected as the Ayanshi. 
Though the Collapse denied you the larger market it gave you the time to
prefect your craft.  You remember the tales of your parents, of the men
from the stars who came seeking the art of your world, taking your
artists with them for special commissions.  One day that will all return
and when it does you will be ready, for you are an artist and your life
is but a work in progress.<P>

Patzaitah or member of the Inoshan Order (players choice); otherwise,
contact is Artisan.<BR>
	<B>Other Effects</B>: For every term roll vs. Impossible Fine Arts Skill if
roll is successful increase SOC by 2 as the character has created a
master piece.  Use SOC for starting money, if the character creates a
master piece double income for term.  Once the character has created a
master piece their SOC will only increase by 1 for the completion of a
second master piece; however, income will double again.</ul>

<B>Patzaitah</B>:
	The Patzaitah are the disciples of the Oracle.  It is your duty to
collect the knowledge and secrets of your people.  You are closer to the
Inchata than most but not nearly as close as the Oracle.  Sometime the
Inchata invades your thoughts and dreams giving you visions or insight
into problems once thought insurmountable.  The Inchata is there, just
beyond your reach.  Perhaps one day it will reach to you.<P>

<B>Inoshan Order</B>:
	For a thousand thousand years the members of the Inoshan Order have
served the disciples of the Oracle.  They guard her holy sites and are
the defenders the Patzaitah. There is a sacred trust there for as they
defend and watch over the people it is you who must defend and watch
over them.  There is no profession more honorable or respected, for
while they are the bringers of life, you are its keepers, the guardians
of the Ayata.<P>

<B>Inoshan Marine</B>:
	With the return of the people from the stars four years ago your life
changed.  You went to their world where they trained you in a different
art of war.  You learned about new weapons, new world and new enemies,
learned about steel hearted starships that could rain fire on a world
without even seeing what they were destroying, learned about metallic
creations whos only thought was to kill and learned about people who
had forgotten what it meant to be human.  The universe had become an
evil place since the Ayanshi were last here but the Oracle sent you to
do a job and no one argues with the Oracle.<P>
