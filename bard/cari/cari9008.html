<h3>Physical Appearance</h3> Bwap are 1.3 to 1.5 meter tall
bipeds of lizard or salamander appearance. They
possess rubbery, mottled skin that glistens with
moisture. They have a blunt snout, and two large,
black ovoid eyes. The arms and legs are chubby in
appearance, and they have four digits on foot and
hand, the latter possessing three three-jointed
fingers and an opposable thumb. Finally a long thick
tail sticks out to the rear.
<P>
Because Bwap must keep their skin moist, in conditions
of less than 80% humidity, a special kaftan and hood
are worn at all times over the head and torso. These
are plumbed with capillaries that pass water over the
skin.  It is also the source of the antebellum period
"towelhead" nickname. Bwap blood is copper based, and
in areas where skin pigmentation recedes a bluish hue
can be seen to the skin.  Mottling and shading of the
skin differs between Bwap creches, and these are often
used by the Bwap to further distinguish themselves.
<P>
<h3>Bwap Homeworlds</h3> Bwap were most commonly found in the
coreward and trailing areas of the Antebellum
Imperium. Since the Collapse their numbers have been
much reduced, but they continue to thrive on worlds
where conditions are amenable to their survival. Bwap
are comfortable on worlds of size 4-7, atmosphere 6-9,
a hydrography of 7-9, and an antebellum population of
6-8.  Worlds with these attributes and an antebellum
government code of 6+ will have a surviving Bwap
Creche present on a 2d6 roll of 8+, and a DM of +1 if
the world was located in Vland, Lishun, Empty Quarter,
Dagudashaag, Fornast or Ley sectors. In the Regency
all worlds of code Industrial or High Population will
automatically have a creche, in addition to the
requirements above.
<P>
A Creche varies largely in size, but on average will
not exceed more than 10% of the local population. On
most worlds in the Wilds a creche will only number a
few hundred to a few thousand individuals in an aliens
quarter in the main city or settlement. In surviving
Pocket Empires or the Regency, creches of up to fifty
million individuals are possible on high population
worlds. Each creche is a self contained community with
its own internal laws and customs, security and public
services, and education and health care facilities.  A
creche of more than ten thousand Bwap will possess a
smaller version of the giant Bwap Administrative
Academies that once loomed over the training of
Imperial Bureaucrats.  Bwap creches often have their
own starships, lovingly maintained, and in many cases
are likely to possess covertly materials and
technology that are 1d6-2 points higher than the local
TL. All Creches, regardless of where they are, report
at the local and interstellar levels to a Council of
Order, the Wewaka-Atapas.
<P>

<P>
Bwap roll for initiative normally.
<P>
Bwaps begin aging at 31, rather than 35.
<P>
Psionics are rare, but present.  They have a dm of -3
when rolling for psionic talents.
<P>
In antebellum times 9 out of 10 Bwap characters are
likely to be male. In the Regency, this number falls
to 2 out of 3, and in the Wilds it falls to parity.
<P>
<h3>Careers</h3>
<P>
Bwaps can not be Undercover Agents, Corsairs or
Criminals and can not have the following skills:
bribery, forgery, gambling and streetwise(*).  They
are also rarely in found in the following careers:
Athlete, Barbarian, Entertainer, Martial Artist,
Mercenary and Rebel(*). They have no hereditary
nobility, though they did receive Imperial titles in
the past.   High Social standing meerly indicates a
level of respect. Most Bwap characters are usually
associated with the bureaucracy, corporate management,
administrative positions in trading vessels or
military units, research positions in academia or
RISS, and jobs as investigators and inspectors in the
police, customs and Quarantine Service.
<P>
An (*) indicates skills and careers open to
Satha-a-attas-wapawab and Tap-a-wewaka-atapas
characters only.
<P>
The Bwap Administrative Academies were established during the Rule of
Man to provide a steady supply of trained Bwap
bureaucrats and administrators. These facilities are
rare and far between. In antebellum times only three
worlds in the Third Imperium possessed such
facilities: Capitol, Vland and Marhaban itself. Since
the Collapse the Regency of Deneb has established four
new smaller facilities on Mora, Lunion, Tobia and
Vincennes. Admittance to these facilities is limited
to Bwap, though Human, Dolphin and Aslan are permitted
to attend special exchange programs.
<P>
Bwap Academies offer a four year program that
culminates in the equivalent to an undergraduate
degree. Bwap graduates automatically recieve
Admin/Legal 2, and can recieve skills, equal to their
educational level, in Economics, Fine Arts,
Interaction, Perception and Social Science.
<P>
Graduates usually enter Bureaucrat, Computer
Programmer, Diplomat, Manager and Trader careers; or
can opt for admittance to Law or Graduate School.
<P>
<h3>Bwap Specific Careers</h3>
<P>
<h4>Satha-a-atta-wapawab (Elder of the Creche)</h4>

Elders of
the Creche are a combination of teacher, theologian,
diplomat and shaman. They are chiefly responsible for
the indoctrination and cultivation of young Bwap in
the races Wepawab (tree of life) philosophy, and are
often called upon to provide mediation and information
gathering services for creches located far from the
homeworld. Since the Collapse, Elders have become even
more important; in conjunction with Guardians they
anchor lines of communication across the Wilds between
isolated Bwap communities.  Elders only recieve one
term of training, and then must enlist in another
career for subsequent terms. But they are subject to
lifetime recall by their people, and can substitute
the special duty listed below for one in their normal
career. Other careers popular with Bwap Elders include
Academia, Diplomacy and Journalism.  In the Regency
RISS and RQS are also popular.
<P>
<B>Prerequisite:</B> Bwap, Homeworld pre-industrial+ <BR>
<B>First Term:</B> Theology (Wepawab) 4, Instruction 3, Interaction 2, Perception 2.<BR>
<B>Subsequent Terms:</B> Must enlist in another career upon completion of first term.<BR>
<B>Special Duty:</B> Roll 7+ for Explore, Language, Spacehand, Theology (Wepawab) and Vice.<BR>
<B>Promotion:</B> As per normal career.<BR>
<B>Contacts:</B> As per normal career, plus any two Bwap contacts for every special duty recieved.<BR>
<B>Other Effects:</B> Recieve two secondary activities per term.<BR>
<P>
<h4>Tap-a-wewakas-atapas (Guardian of Order)</h4>
<P>
A Guardian of Order is a combination of bureaucrat,
police officer and inquisitor. They are charged with
ensuring that creches remain faithful to the Wepawab,
and are not violating their integrity through
corruption or ethical backsliding.  In antebellum
times the Wepawab took more the form of bureaucratic
conduct code that was informally recognised by the
Third Imperium, and to a more limited extent by the
Regency. In those days a Guardian was more akin to an
official inspector who examined the books and
operations of various creches and their members. If a
creche was found to be in violation of the Wepawab,
the Guardians meted out the appropriate punishment,
including dissolution of the guilty creche. Since the
Collapse, though, the Wepawab has been revived as an
overriding philosophy, and the Guardians have become
just that, maintainers of the safety and survival of
those Creches that have survived into the New Era.
<P>
<B>Prerequisite:</B> Bwap, Homeworld pre-industrial+, Graduation from a Bwap Academy.<BR>
<B>First Term:</B> Acrobat 2, Determination 1, Gun Combat 2, Economics 1, Interaction 1, Melee 1, Space Vessel 1 (Regency Only)<BR>
<B>Subsequent Terms Skills:</B> Charm, Determination, Economics, Explore, Gun Combat, Perception, Space Vessel, Spacehand, Technician<BR>
<B>Special Duty:</B> Roll 6+ for Acrobat, Crime, Explore, Melee, Spacehand, Tactics or Vice.<BR>
<B>Contacts:</B> 2 per term. 1 must be a Bwap academic, government or military.<BR>
<B>Other Effects:</B> 2 Secondary Activities per term. 3 Ship
DMs per term, with the roll on the warship table in
the rulebook. Successful roll of a ship with the term
"mod" in it causes the character to recieve a Bwap
<a href="../sara/sara9028.html"><I>Teth-o-wewaka-atapas</I> class Runabout</A>. If the ship is
recieved the character becomes an Elder Guardian
responsible for a region of space, recieves a 2+ Soc
benefit, and is subject to recal to local Wewakas for
life.
<P>
<h3>Bwap in the New Era</h3> Bwap characters are
anal-retentive. They love order and harmony, and
disdain unclean or disordered surroundings. And that
is where they have so much potential in the New Era:
if given half of the chance they are likely to slowly
and quietly rebuild the former Imperium all by
themselves. They do not put themselves into the
limelight, preferring to reconstruct the shattered
worlds of the Wilds from the shadows. In most places
survival has been paramount for the local Creches, and
compromises have to be made in the face of hostile
local conditions. But where circumstances permit it,
Bwap shine in the darkness. Most Bwap will be found in
alliance with the more benign TEDs and an occasional
friendly Vampire Fleet, quietly directing their
efforts, and ordering and constructing their
communities and forces.  Many more may work on
surviving Free Traders, laboring to help keep them
running. Some may even work as pursers and
quartermasters for the Mercantile Guild.
<P>
But no matter what their vocation, all Bwap are
committed to the overriding command of their Wapawab
philosophy, and are often more intent upon using the
indifference and venality of their human employers to
fill their own sails. Because of the resentment and
fear of these tough times, Bwap are unlikely to
collect or display wealth and power, preferring to
invest it into community funds that tie local humans
to their creches.  Bwap traders and scouts scrounge
the local space in search of vital technology, and
keep on the lookout for corsairs and hostile Vampire
Fleets. They act as negotiators and go-betweens in the
wars between local TEDs, or with hostile Vampires.
They keep commerce running, infrastructure repaired
and maintained, and see to the needs of the sick and
destitute.  They faithfully serve human masters, never
betraying judgementalism, but always upholding the
welfare of their masters' people and homeland.  A
universe of darkness offends these gentle creatures,
and they will rekindle the flame of justice by hook or
by crook, if necessary.
