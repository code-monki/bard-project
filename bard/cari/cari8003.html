<b>Homeworld</b>: The Thaggeshi are a minor human race in Vland sector. Their
homeworld has a B starport and a fair degree of technology. Their home system
is a trinary system.<p>

<h3>Physiology</h3>
<p>      To talk of Thaggeshi physiology is somewhat difficult since the members
of this race display a wide range of variation. While the range of genotype
variations is by no means as extensive as among the Solomani, the range is
much larger than has come to be expected among the minor human races. This
variation is one thing that sets the Thaggeshi apart from the other minor human racess.
  <p>    Height and weight: Thaggess possesses a marginally lower gravity than
1G, and this has affected the Thaggeshi physique. The average Thaggeshi stands
about 1.65 meters tall and weighs about 65 kilograms. Females stand about 1.55
meters tall and weigh around 60 kg. By no means, however, does this average
preclude variation. Depending on the region of Thaggesh from which they come,
Thaggeshi exhibit a great deal of variance. The aforementioned is merely a
statistical average.
  <p>    Appearance: Again, one cannot make generalizations. Most Thaggeshi have
somewhat swarthy skin tones (given that Thaggesh is poart of a trinary star
system). Thos from more northerly regions have lighter skin tone, while
equatorial and southern Thaggeshi have darker skin.
   <p>   Hair is usually dark, even among northern Thaggeshi, and straight hair
predominates. A chance mutation gave about 5% of the Thaggeshi population
platinum-colored hair. This hair color looks more striking among the dark-
skinned inhabitats of the equator and farther south.
 <p>     Diet: The Thaggeshi exhibit omnivorous dietary habits. The native life
is not completely compatible with human biochemistry. Consequently, the
Thaggeshi learned (or were taught by the Ancients) the skills needed to make
the food ready for human consumption. Unlike the Vilani, however, no shugilii-
type class developed, since the Ancients also transplanted to Thaggesh a few
animals like the bovine herbivore called an ashat which has become
domesticated and a staple of the Thaggeshi diet. Thus, the Thaggeshi subsist
on both specially-prepared native foods and a few transplanted animals and
plants.
  <p>    Reproduction: Thaggeshi differ little from Vilani-Solomani norms.
Females bear live infants after a nine-month gestation period. Their lower
level of medical knowledge resulted in a number of taboos and superstitions
about pregnancy and childbirth , some of which survive to this day. Chief
among these is the belief that the unborn child is capable of contact with God
before birth. Thus, how the child kicks or moves have been interpreted in
various ways as auguries and divinations coming directly from God. Other,
similar ideas consist despite Thaggesh's technological advance ment under
Vilani supervision.
   <p>   Senses: Thaggeshi senses are about the same as other humans: they show
no real differences in sensory abilities. They believe, however, that there
are six senses, not five. This sixth sense is somewhat analogous to common
sense. They say this sense gives them their innate ideas about the the world
around them.
   <p>   The Thaggeshi do not adhere to the "blank slate" theory of epistemology.
Instead, they believe that one is born with certain ideas, and that one can
come to conclusions about the universe from extrapopalting those ideas.
   <p>   Anatomy: No major deviations from norms found elsewhere. Like the
Zhodani, however, they have only 32 teeth. Their teeth are somewhat larger
than Solomani and Vilani teeth. Bllod types include F, G, H, N, and P, with
the dominant types being F, G, and H.
   <p>   Lifespan: Typical lifespan is between 80 and 90 years. Thaggeshi with
mixed Vilani blood and those who live in the northern latitudes show greater
longevity. The reason for the latter has been deduced to be dietary, since
these Thaggeshi eat native wildlife almost exclusively: the ashat cannot
survive in the colder climes.

<h3>Psychology</h3>
<p>
  
<p>      Despite the lack of homogeneity among the Thaggeshi in physical terms,
one is somewhat surprised by the existence of what one can call a Thaggeshi
mindset. Yet the Thaggeshi do have several aspects of their psychology that
one finds all over their homeworld.
 <p>     The extent to which one adheres to this way of thinking determines
membership in the Thaggeshi community. Offworlders of even non-human
extraction who follow Thaggeshi ways would be considered more of a "true"
Thaggeshi than a human from Thaggesh who had abandoned the traditional ways.
First, Thaggeshi are a very traditional people. They have great respect for
their ancestors and their accomplishments. Ancestor-worship is a common form
of piety: most Thaggeshi have small shrines in their homes dedicated to their
famous and influential ancestors. Thaggeshi are rather slow to change. If
something works, there is no reason to change it in any way. Early Vilani
explorers found this aspect comforting. Unlike the Vilani, however, the
Thaggeshi have rather ritualized their repsect for tradition. Many taboos and
superstitions still exist, because they have always existed and they seem to
be in keeping with the truth.
 <p>     Second, ritualism and traditionalism have made Thaggeshi society
somewhat stagnant. When the Vilanicontacted them, the Thaggeshi had been at
tech level 1 for several thousand years. Even the Vilani considered them
somewhat backward and plodding. Under their influence and encouragement,
Thaggesh has advanced in technology without any real change in the basic
Thaggeshi mindset.
   <p>   Third, technology is seen as another form of magic. The principles are a
little different, but the basic concept is the same. Technology is kept in the
hands of a few, but is used for the benefit of the whole. Thus, technology is
not used as a means to enslave lower classes. In keeping with their
shamanistic past, the Thaggeshi merely passed control of this new magic onto a
special group.
  <p>    Fourth, Thaggeshi have great respect for their planet and its nature.
From earliest times, the Thaggeshi have been acutely aware that upsetting the
delicate balance of their planet would result in their deaths. With only a few
animals edible without preparation, one tends to be very much concerned about
keeping those plants and animals healthy. One reason that magic and technology
were always kept in the hands of a few was to prevent its misuse.
   <p>   In this way, the Thaggeshi developed a kind of ecological mindset that
is often found among primitive peoples. The advance of technological
sophistication has not altered this thought pattern as it often does in other
races. Such would not only be aviolation of tradition but just plain stupid.
<p>

<h3>Society and Culture</h3>

  <p>    Society revolves around tradition. The government of choice is
autocracy. The autocrat knows, however, that abusing power would not be good
for him or his people. One might call Thaggeshi government an "enlightened
despotism."
  <p>    The concept of tyranny is one that the Thaggeshi do not really
understand. For this reason, the events of the Rebellion around them seems
very odd. First, they do not comprehend the idea of killing a leader. (Such
has never occured in Thaggeshi history). Second, they don't understand there
being such a thing as a bad leader.
  <p>    Thaggeshi society has no really distinct classes with the exception of
the priestly class of technologists and the rulers. The remainder of the
population has no distinctions other than that of occupation, and one can
easily change occupations. No lower class really exists, since Thaggeshi
mindset holds that one should help the less fortunate. This principle is a
logical extension of the governmental principle of enlightened despotism. If
one were to ignore the less fortunate when one is himself able to help, then
someday one may be in the same situation and without anywhere to turn.
Furthermore, society as a whole would be seen as failed in some way of a lower
class were allowed to develop.
   <p>   Th priest/technologist class is charged with the handling and
advancement of technology. Entrance into this class is determined through
various traditional divinstic methods at birth. Thse people are trained from
an early age in the ways of technology and its proper uses in society. The
remainder of the population has little or no understanding of technology
beyond what they need to lead their daily lives. Even then, what the Thaggeshi
may know id mostly by rote and of a "black box" mentality. This stems not from
any specialization ideal like the Vilani, but rather from a desire to use
techology properly.
   <p>   To many, the Thaggeshi seem a living cliche, the noble savage living in
harmony with nature. Such a picture is not entirely accurate, but the ideal
does not exactly reflect the reality. Thaggeshi society is certainly
harmonious and well-ordered, but at the expense of creativity and innovation.
One may see the Thaggeshi society as an ideal, but most people would probably
prefer their own way of life, whatever its problems.
   <p>   As an interstellar society, the Thaggeshi have had a difficult time of
things. Trying to prevent outside contamination of ideas is very difficult and
well nigh impossible. Thus, it is conceivable that Thaggesh may very well
under an upheaval in the future. Given the nature of the Thaggeshi people,
such a revolution could be very dangerous indeed.

<h3>Thaggeshi in the New Era</h3>
<p>

Because technology is used in such a limited fashion in Thaggeshi society, the
Thaggeshi were able to survive the onslaught of Virus much better than most
other inhabitants of Vland Sector.
<p>
The priest/technologist class quickly and efficiently determined which
technological elements were at fault and removed them from use.
<p>
As a result of these actions, the listed technology level of 9 reflects the use of
non-computer technology. Thaggeshi computer technology would be more
accurately described as TL 8.
<p>
Employing only a few squadrons of SDBs in defense against Vampire Fleet
attacks, the Thaggeshi have not reestablished any form of interstellar
communication and, in fact, see no need to. They are content to live out their
lives apart from the interstellar community as they had for millenia before first
contact with the Vilani.<p>
