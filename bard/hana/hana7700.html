Imagine if you will.  You're living on the planet Nubnub near the core
of some Imperial noble's territory.  Now there's a war that's been going
on for nearly a decade, you've never really seen the war, well not much
just a few beat up ships and injured soldiers on the Vid's, pictures of
war but nothing local.  One morning you wake up on your own, damn alarm
didn't go off because there's a power outage.  Now this isn't out of the
ordinary so you're not terribly alarmed.  You pick up the phone, or
whatever the local equivilant is to tell your boss you're going to be
late and you notice that the phone acting up, this wierd sqealie noise.<P> 

So you hustle it to get to work, cold shower, water heater operates off
electric power.  Cold cereal, you close the fidge quickly, don't wan't
to lose any of that cold air.  You'd prefer hot oatmeal but the cookers
are all electic so you suffer in silence.  Rushing out to your grav-car
you notice that the local traffic net is down and there's only a
fraction of the traffic you'd expect to see on a monday morning.  Five
minutes later you show up at the office, no power again, what you
thought was just a local outage seems to have effected the whole city.
So you walk up the thirty floors to your office, there's no coffee, no
tea just cold water.  None of the computers work, due in large part to
the power outage so you and your friends sit around for most of the day
listening to a portable radio someone abandoned in the lunchroom decades
ago.  One of the girls had a spare set of battaries in her desk and
aparntly the radio station is running off a generator in their basement.<P> 

You start to hear stories, apparently the main powerplant for the city
went critical sometime during the night and destroyed most of the
underwater parts of the town.  Emergency vehicles are everywhere trying
to put out fires caused by drivers trying to log onto the traffic net
and having their cars go wild and apparently a huge chunk of the
Whiteside Arcology collapsed in the middle of the night when all three
sets of back up gravitic generators failed to come on line.  Things are
looking bad so you and the people from work decide to pool your
resources and spent the night at Dale's place because at least he has an
emergency generator.<P> 

On your way home the sky is thick with smoke, somethings really wrong
and you watch in horror as a public transit airfilm jumps it's tracks
and tears through four blocks of industrial complex and residential
housing.  At home you quickly throw all you're perishable's into a bag
for transport to Dale's house, working quickly you grab some clothes and
a heavy parka, winter's just around the corner and you never know how
cold it might get tonight.<P> 

Two hours later you show up at Dale's.  Three of the ten of the ten from
the office never show up.  The fires continue on through the night, you
watch in horror as the cities secondary power plant suddenly comes on
line.  Lights up half the city to a million candle power before going
critical and nuking the entire south side in a blinding flash of
supercritical plasma.<P> 

Four day's later you're begining to run low on food, the police had
instituted a dusk till dawn curfu in an attempt to control the rioters.
Dale suggests making a quick trip to your house to grab all your canned
food and the remainder of the hydrogen from your grav-car's fuel tank to
keep the generator running.  When you get home you discover that most of
your neighborhood has been systematically looted, a two day old corpse
lies in your living room and anything of value has been systematically
removed.  Fortunately they were just after material goods and not food
so you quickly clear out the cupboards and basement.  Dale for some
reason grabs all your knives, an old fashioned set of binoculars your
grandfather gave you before scooping all the medical supplies he can
find in your bathroom.  Though you ask him why, Dale just grunts and
tells you to grab the warmest clothes you can find.  Twenty minutes late
you finish loading up his truck when Edward and Delilah return from
scouting out your neighbors houses.  Dale looks happy with their prizes
and you all hop back into the truck for the return trip.<P> 

On the fifth day things have gone from bad to worse, the authorities
stopped trying to put out the fires when chuncks of the orbital A-Class
starport began falling out of orbit.  Though much of it burned up on
re-entry a large chunk of it fell on the mountians to the south carving
out a kilometer long scar in the planets surface and starting thousands
of fires.<P> 

It's now ten days since the power went out.  The sky is dark now, and
the smell of smoke is everywhere.  Pieces of the starport still streak
across the skies at regular intervals.  Dale shut off the generator
nearly a week ago and packed you all up into his truck with the remains
of your food and supplies.  The looters had showed up the day before
that and you'd killed ten of them before they finally fled, Dale decided
he'd had enough and it was time to leave.<P> 

It's been fifteen day's now the burned out wreckage of a thousand car
pile up chokes the Freeway in front of you.  That first body in your
house shocked you, you couldn't help but throw up, you've seen so many
bodies now they don't even phase you.  Sarah from accouting still
cringes but you're numb.  You have to abandon the truck and start
walking<P> 

Nearly a month has passed, you count yourself among the lucky, you're
still alive, finding food has become increasingly difficult and the
canned food you started with ran out over a week ago.  A pair of soldier
joined up with you last week their unit had been over run by a starving
mob.  They've got rifles and some extra ammunition, your handgun's
running preciously low.  The hill top you're standing on overlooks a
small town burned to the ground.  A dozen empty vehicles lay abandoned
on the side of the road.  To conserve his lighter Dale's been pulling
one of the lenses out of your binoculars and using it to light fires.
He's a pretty smart guy that Dale, you probably wouldn't have made it
this far without him, but winter's approaching and you still don't have
any shelter or long term supplies.  Dale says not to worry, but you
can't help it.<P> 

The first snow fell last night, you feel pretty sorry for anyone not in
door's like you and the rest of Dale's people.  Dale knew about this
small town nestled in a remote valley near the northern edge of the
mountians, he had friends there, family you might say.  Dale had always
been afraid it might come to something like this so him and a group of
his Scout Service buddies had made arraingements.  Stockpiled enough
supplies for a season, seed, some weapons and even a few other
essentials.  It's been more than two months since you've had the
electricity to shave, but at least you're safe here, for a while at
least.  Who knows about tommorow, but today at least you're safe, warm
and alive.  Thats more than you can say for half the people on your
planet and winter's just coming.<P> 

<hr>

Think about it carefully, you've got no power, how many things do you
rely on that use power?<P> 

Could you make power?  How?<P> 

Could you aquire food?  How about perserve it?<P> 

What would you consider the bare essentials for survival?  The clothes
on your back?  The clothes in your closet?  A gun?  A knife?<P> 

How long could you survive on a weeks rations?  How would you build
shelter?  Keep warm?  Could you start a fire with the contents of your
pockets?  What about in two months when your lighter runs out of fuel,
what would you do then?<P> 

Think about it and we're only TL8, now imagine falling from TL15.  Look
at the contents of your pockets.  Key's flat little pieces of metal yet
we're totally screwed with out them, imagine if everything your life
depended on suddenly stopped working.  What would happen then?<P>
