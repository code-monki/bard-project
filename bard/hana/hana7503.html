I assume the Confederation has a naval structure similar to the Imperium,
with approximately one major fleet per subsector.<P>

The Confederation Navy consists of mostly large capital ships: battleships,
dreadnoughts, battlecruisers and carriers.  Smaller ships such as escorts
and auxiliaries are supplied by the individual states of the Confederation.
These forces are rotated every few years, and more can be activated in times of
war.<P>

After the Solomani decided to invade, the order went out to the Fleets of
the Confederation Navy, to move towards the Imperial border to participate in a
series of War Games. The members states of the Confederation were invited to
send ships to participate in these games.  When the official news of the
Emperor's death reached the fleets, the fleets were ordered to invade.<P>

The Confederation Naval Fleets were grouped into several large fleets. These
massed fleets were used against major Imperial targets, such as naval bases,
subsector capitals,  high population worlds and the like.  Some of the
member worlds ships were attached to these fleets, but the majority operated alone.
The ships from the member worlds were sent after the smaller less formidable
targets, such as secondary worlds, Scout bases, X-boat Way Stations etc.
They were also charged with commerce raiding.<P>

The major fleets would hit the heavy targets and then jump onto the next
target. If they could destroy the Imperial fleets, this would destroy the Imperium's
ability to counter attack.  The individual worlds could then be taken by
reinforcements and the fleets of the member worlds.  While the initial
attackcame primarily from the fleets of Alpha Crucis, fleets from the rimward edge
of the Confederation would arrive several months later.<P>

At the same time as the military offensive was underway SolSec played its
part in the invasion.  It staged numerous coups across Imperial space.  Agents on
several worlds lead worker's strikes to protest government actions.  Other
agents carried out acts of sabotage or terrorism.  Solomani supported groups
were urged to strike out against the government. In general SolSec tried to
create as much disruption as possible. Most of these actions were not
intended to win worlds for the Solomani, but rather to disrupt these worlds and to
provide a distraction to the Imperial forces. This chaos would make it that
much easier for the Confederation military to emerge victorious.<P>

To conquer the worlds of the Imperium various tactics were followed
depending on the individual worlds. The first priority of the Confederation were the high
population, high tech worlds. These had to be seized otherwise they could
produce enough armaments to fight off the Confederation. Once taken, this
same industrial might could be used for Confederation.  These worlds almost
always had significant system defense forces. After these were eliminated, the
world would be offered a choice to surrender. Any world that surrendered and
joined the Confederation would be allowed to keep on governing itself. It would
have to allow SolSec monitors in the government to assure that its conversion was
not a ruse. It would also have to agree to abide by the laws of the Confederation.
Most of the time this surrender offer was ignored.  The Confederation Army
was then brought to bear, for a full scale invasion of the world.  Worlds that
had to be taken by force, had their government replaced by a military tribunal
which would eventually be replaced by a government designed by the Confederation.
These replacement governments were usually designed by SolSec.<P>

The next priority were high-tech industrial worlds.  These were usually
attacked by naval forces belonging to the member worlds of the Confederation. They
were offered the same choice of surrender.  If these worlds refused to surrender,
they were either invaded or their starports and industrial sites bombarded.
The decision was normally made on the basis of available troops.  If the world
was bombarded, it would be left until there was sufficient troops available to
invade.<P>

The forces of the member worlds often did not have the same strict training
and regulation that the regular military had.  This often led to
instances where excessive force was used. Several worlds in the Old Expanses
had nuclear and biological weapons used against them.  unfortunately after these
weapons are used against a world, they are unlikely to become loyal members
of the Confederation in the near future.<P>

Low priority targets such as worlds with small populations (under a
million), low-tech worlds and the like were visited by a small taskforce made up of
light ships from the member worlds of the Confederation. The world was offered a
chance to join the Confederation. If this offer was refused the world was ignored
until a later date when more resources were available. Often the departing forces
would destroy targets of military significance if it could be done with
minimal risk. It was hoped that many of these worlds would realize that their
situation was hopeless, as commerce dried up, and the Solomani eliminated the
remaining Imperial forces and all the surrounding worlds were absorbed by the
Confederation.<P>

In general the Confederation forces were used as fast acting strike force.
Hammering the largest concentrations of Imperial military forces and moving
onto the next target.  They spent a minimal amount of time consolidating their
gains. They left this to the slower moving and lighter member world forces and to
the Confederation Army. Any Imperial counter attacks would be met by the
reinforcements coming from the Rimward sectors of the Confederation and
Reserve forces that could be activated.  The Solomani felt the borders with the Hive
Federation were fairly safe. The border with the Aslan was far less safe and
those sectors were not stripped of forces to such a large degree.<P>
