<B>Hindahl/Old Expanses</B>  224/1117<BR>
Sector naval HQ today announced the transfer of the Old Expanses fleet
to Zarushagar for operations against Dulinor. The announcement indicated
that all of the first line fleets would be transfered within 60 days.<P>

"The defense of the sector lies in the capable hands of our reserve
squadrons," Sector Admiral Hinchliffe said today.<P>

<P><HR><P>

<B>Hindahl/Old Expanses</B> 350/1117 <BR>
In the face of continued Solomani fleet actiins, a rise in Solomani
political activity in the sector and a lack of defenses for the region,
a coalition of dukes within the Old Expanses announced the voluntary 
incorporation of the sector into the Solomani Confederation.<P>

A spokesman hinted that the Confederation had made certain guarentees to
the region, and that no immediate changes in local governmetn
were contemplated.
<P>

<B>Anaxias Delphi</B>  101/1119<BR>

With the bulk of her reserve fleets holding off Lucan, Margret has mustered
enough strength to mount an attack against the Solomani in Old Expanses.<P>

Concentrating the realtively fresh forces of her 145th, 137th and 67th
fleets, Margaret has penetrated 10pcs behind forward Solomani fleets, 
disrupting ther lines of communication and supply, and spread out to
cut off their retreat.
Additional forces attacking out of Delphi are squeezin pockets of Solomani
Ships out of the area, forcing many of them to disband into small even
single ship squadrons to atttempt a breakout to rimward.<P>

<P><HR><P>

<B>Gerdane/Hinterworlds</B>  133/1119<BR>

Three asteroid mining vessels tangled with a lone Solomani destroyer
in the Gerdane.  Speculation is that Margarets thrust into Old Expanses
are forcing Solomani vessels to break out in whatever direction they can.
<P>
<P><HR><P> 

<B>Vaward/Old Expanses</B> 244 1121<BR>
An undisclosed task force has intercepted the approaching Solomani thrust
from the Twenty One Worlds subsector and defeated it. Reports confirmed
that the Solomani task force   said to include on Batron and two Cruons  
was ambushed by a numerically superior force of Imperial craft.<P>

Solomani losses were said to be heavy, whereas friendly forces were said
to have suffered only light damage.<P>

Undisclosed sources within Margaret's military organization suggested that
the task force was not a reserve or secret unit. The same source
also admitted that the mystery fleet might not be so friendly next time.<P>

(The fleet was the 22nd Imperial Fleet, most of the 93rd Imperial fleet
and elements of the 1092nd and 1101st Reserve fleets, which are controlled
by IRIS)<P>
<P><HR><P>

In <B>076/1117</B> the Solomani Invade the Old Expanes (R:19)  <P>

<B>224/1117</B> Lucan, unaware of the Solomani Invasion, orders the Sector
fleet to Zarushagar.  (SM:13)<P>

<B>284/1117</B> All first line Imperial ships have left the sector. 
The only Imperial forces remaining are obselecent Reserve fleets.
<P>
<B>200 365</B> The Solomani make major advances, first taking all of Alpha
Crucis in short order, then the rimward subsectors of the Old
Expanses.  <P>

<B>350/1117</B> The Sector Duke surrender and "voluntarily" incorporates the Old Expanses into the
Solomani Confederation (SM:19).<P>

<B>365/1117</B> The Solomani control all former Imperial territory in
Subsectors P, O, N, L, K and H. Large portions of subsectors G, J, M and 
portions of F and I subsectors.  (R:72)<P>

The only major resistance to the Solomani is in subsector M, where
elements of the Diasporan fleets strike back against the Solomani. They manage to
wrest control of a quarter of the worlds back from the Solomani. <P>

At the time of the Sector duke's surrender, the surviving reserve fleets
are ordered to surrender. About 1/3 of them do so, these are mostly
those in areas controlled by the Solomani. Those fleets in the spinward 
area of the Sector flee to Diaspora. These come to about 1/4 of the total 
reserve ships. The fleets in the coreward four subsectors,
who have been assured that the Imperial fleets in Delphi and Massilia will
support them, ignore the order. <P>

The 1138th Reserve Fleet, whose base of operation was subsector L, fled
into the Hinterworlds, where they found a home in Khi/Nullia. A small
world with no formal government, which was "persuaded" to allow the
fleet to establish a base of operations.  From their base they launched 
commerce raids against Solomani targets in the Hinterworlds, Old Expanses
and even in Alpha Crucis. They proved to be an annoyence to the Solomani,
yet their actions were never of great import. The Solomani never pursued
them vigourously. They didn't want send a battle fleet into the
Hinterworlds, which might disrupt many of the diplomatic negotiations
underway.The fleet suffered major losses in 1120 when elements of it jumped
into Zi/Sitah/Old Expanses and encountered a Solomani fleet travelling from Neworld Sector to
Diaspora. After that the fleet gave up most offensive action, and
degenerated into a mercenary unit for worlds around Nullia Subsector. Though
weak by Imperial standards, it was impressive in the backwater
Hinterworlds. Several elements of the fleet eventually joined up
with the Nullian League, and helped expand the League before the
Collapse.<P>

It should be noted that the Solomani are fighting against Lucan's
forces along the Diaspora/Old Expanses</B> border, and against Margret's
forces along the Coreward portion of Old Expanses.  The two forces
were as likely to fight each other, as the Solomani.  They never
attempted any coordinated effort against the Solomani.  <P>

<B>1118</B> the Solomani pushed out all Imperial forces from
Subsector M and pushed into subsector P of Diaspora. The Imperials
managed to stall the offensive and for the rest of the war, the Solomani
would advance no farther into Diaspora, though at a terrible cost to
both fleets and to the worlds between them. By the end of the year
the Solomani had managed to take the rest of F G and J subsectors, and
large portions of I and E.  Major battles were fought in A and B E, 
though not quite as heavy as the previous year in M. The reserve fleets 
in the coreward four subsectors were reinforced by fleets from Delphi.<P>

<B>1119</B>  Margret launched a major offensive against the Solomani and was able
to push them back slightly in subsector F. There was
intense fighting across this entire subsector, with heavy damage to all
involved. This is also the site of the Imperial depot, which the Solomani
captured largely intact after the surrender of the sector.  Margaret's 
Admirals made its recapture a priority, and they succeded, though the 
Solomani left the depot much the worse for their occupation. The few
remaining capital ships were  either sabotaged or booby trapped.
The Solomani had managed to reactivate most of the capital ships, so
there were only a few dozen left at the time the depot was retaken.
The major repair asteroids were heavily damaged by nuclear weapons from 
the retreating Solomani.<P>

The Solomani totaly controlled the rimward 8 subsectors of the
Old Expanses and were busy consolidating their holdings.  To help
consolidate the holdings Transstar, the Solomani's sole megacorporation,
which was also an arm of the Solomani Party was brought in. It established
holdings on many worlds helping to rebuild them, so that they could 
better serve the Confederation.   Holdings of the former Imperial Megacorporations are nationalized and put under control of Transstar. This creates some disruption as employees with Imperial loyalties destroy paperwork and records. 
The Solomani leave non-megacorporations alone, as only the Megacorporations have large portions of their stock controlled by the Imperial family.<P>

<B>1120</B> The fighting along the Magaret/Solomani Border slowed, but did
not stop, Major battles still took place in Subsectors E and F.
By the end of the year the Solomani had lost ground on in E, F and G and
H.  Margret firmly controlled most of A and half of B and C, as opposed
to previous years, when much of this territory was in dispute.
Imperial forces managed to force back the Solomani in Subsector L and
P of Diaspora. Deep strike forces made several attacks into Subsector
M of Old Expanses  trying to disrupt supply lines into Diaspora. They attacked Buhle's starport heavily damaging it.
Imperial covert forces are able to land on several worlds and begin guerilla campaigns. They also encourage the local populace to rebel and to strike back. This activity is a major disruption to the
consolidation of Solomani's power.<P>

<B>1121</B>  The IRIS fleets helps Margret defeat the Solomani's last offensive
against Vaward (HT:16). After this the Solomani and Margret trade
deep strikes against each other, but no major offensives are launched.
Little territory changes hands.<P>

<B>1122</B> The battles of the last few years have made it hard for the
Solomani to control the territory they won in E, F G and H subsectors of
the Old Expanses.  The destruction also makes makes the territory barely 
desirable. In 1122, the Solomani barely even make an attempt to claim the 
territory, as most worlds are left to their own.  A few still make some claim to
belong to the Confederation or Margret's Domain, but in truth they are
a wasteland.<P>

<B>1123</B>  The economic damage of the war makes itself felt, as the Solomani
lose control of Subsector I and much of J and M to the Outlands. The
Outlands even extend into subsector N (Sarid), which prior to the economic
impact, had not been effected by the war.<P>

The Solomani's gains in Diaspora, over which so much blood was shed,
evaporate to a bare handful of worlds in P subsector.<P>

<B>1124</B> The Solomani actually make a limited comeback this year, as
they reassert control over M and N, and portions of J. They
even reclaim a world or two in F and G.  The reformist branch of the
Solomani party receives a cease fire delagation from Margret, which
causes a great deal of political unrest in the Confederation. This
unrest stops the Solomani from mounting anymore offensives during
the war. (HT:18)<P>

<B>1125</B> The Solomani are able to reassert themselves over a few more
worlds in P of Diaspora, but lose the ground they won in 1124 in
F and G.  They also lose ground in J and K.<P>


Throughout Hard Times Lucan attacks the Solomani, mostly along the
Solomani Rim front, but also along the Diaspora/Old Expanses</B> Front.
His forces make occasional Black War strikes against Naval bases,
surviving A starports on Industrial/High Pop worlds and High Pop worlds
themselves.  <P>

<B>1130</B> The Solomani, and Margret are both signatories of the Treaty of
Altair which ends the war across the rimward half of the Imperium.
