<h3>The Shaker Cannon (Margaret's Realm)</h3>

The principle of this device originated in the Solomani Confederation, as
a weapon for planetary pacification. The cannon consisted of an
overpowered tractor beam coupled with a high resolution, short range
sensor suite. It operated by targeting a sinusodally driven beam on a
small area of a planet, and varying the frequency until resonance was
achieved in the target, be it a building or a person. Buildings could be
targeted, but unless people were concentrated in a very small area the
more devastating effect of the device - nicknamed the 'Splotch' effect was
unattainable. An often used mode was to target a whole city, at a
frequency that would cause uncontrolled shaking on the sentient targets.
Whilst the Solomani called this mode the 'Judder', the Imperials knew it
as the 'Shimmy', after an inexperienced Navy Scientist named it when
details were first revealed to the public. For a few years the joke that
the device was a Solomani marital aid, designed to allow their wives to
replicate the movements of the famed Mid-East Terran Dancers. Some cruder
comics said the device was more closely focused.
<P>
The device lacked the range, at the highest Confederation technology, to
be more than an orbital bombardment device. It also had to be operated at
high power to have any effect, drawing the bombarding ship towards the
planet, and requiring excessive use of the ship's thrusters - while the
ship had to be kept in a narrow orbital path. This meant that the ship was
a sitting duck to any reasonable planetary defences, and limited it's use
to moderate to low tech targets, or previously pacified planets. One more
method of using the device was for two ships, on widely separated orbital
tracks, to graze the target area - but not the land. The resonance had a
similar effect, but the traction imparted by the air molecules was
negligible enough to drastically cut down on the need for manouvre -
though time on target was lower as the orbital paths quickly diverged.
<P>
During the Rebellion a number of factions experimented with this device,
but only one was able to develop an operational anti-ship version -
Margaret's 'Shaker' Cannon. Perfected at Margaret's Naval Research Lab at
Porto (3211 Massilla). It used a Manipulator, so there was zero net moment
on both the projecting ship and the target, but unlike 'The Hand of
Lucan', which targeted the structure of the ship, the Shaker focused on 
the computers of the enemy, causing the resonant failure of common
computer components - leaving the enemy helpless - but salvageable. Usual
tactics were to launch an attack from out of a gas giant - thus being able
to attack enemy ships at optimal range. After neutralisation the ships
could be manipulated into stable orbits and refitted by the accompanying
auxiliaries. The only known countermeasure was to use the ship's internal
gravity field to damp out the resonance, but as this involved manouvring
the ship to a deck orientation perpendicular to the Shaker's beam it
usually left the ship 'on it's back, unable to bring it's spinal armament
to bear. The device was to be fitted to 12 <I>Mercury</I>-Class Cruisers under
construction at Irlu (2008 Massilla) and Yan (2718 Massilla). The first of
these, the INS <I>Tenacious</I> was declared operational in late 1128. By the
time the Virus swept over Massilla, there were 7 Ships of the <I>Tenacious</I>
Subclass operating, very successfully, on the border between Lucan's and
Margaret's Realms. It is not known if any of these vessels survive in the
New Era. The details on this weapon have been pieced together from
pre-rebellion sources and information from the databanks of a Naval
Courier found drifting in the Acrolund System by the Voskl Trade Alliance
Scout Service in 1202.

<h3>The Esastuu Device (Lucan)</h3>
<P>
This weapon had been proposed in many scientific journals from the dawn of
the Space Age on Terra - an Earthquake Inducer. Over the millennia it
appeared from time to time in some scientific publications - but mainly in
lurid espionage holos. Work on the Esastuu (The Genoee God of Earthquakes)
Device began after the recovery of an Ancient artefact called the Proneela
Engine by a group of Imperial Knights in 1106. The exact workings of the
Engine were never revealed, but information on the Esastuu Device was
stolen by SolSec during the latter stages of the Rebellion. The device was
developed under project 'Wide Stare', and consisted of a powerful, but
short ranged meson gun coupled with an experimental 'Deep Radar'
Densitometer, and a massive supercomputer. The Solomani learned that the
device operated by locating chaotic instabilities in the crust of a world
- points where the right amount of energy input could cause a
disproportionately larger outburst of seismic energy. It was thought this
device was responsible for the spectacular creation of the Leviathan Rift
on Santar (1530 Core). Another fact the Solomani learned was that the
device needed extensive planetary and tectonic data to operate. One
scientist estimated a stay of at least a year on a world to gather the
data for it's use. Thankfully for Lucan, Capital had extensive data on all
aspects of the planets in the Imperium. Fortunately for the Solomani, the
data on the worlds of the Confederation was so old to be useless for the
Device's needs.
<P>
The Solomani pieced together some data on raids conducted against
Margaret, and their newer possessions in Diaspora. There was an attack
conducted against Khipshunam (1108 Massilla) in early 1127, which resulted
in the volcanic destruction of an extensive island chain before the attack
was repelled. Dubleen (1515 Massilla) was thought to have come under
attack, but only minor earth tremors were reported. Finally, an attack on
Ebasha late in 1128 caused extensive damage to the Capital by igniting the
nearby Bearteeth range of mountains. As far as SolSec could determine, all
these attacks involved at least one <I>Triumph</I>-Class battle rider, with at
least one of it's <I>Gallant</I>-Class riders taking no apparent part in the
offensive strike. This lead to the famous Vaward exchange of captured
SolSec and Margaret's operatives. This was ostensibly as a sign of good
faith - but also as a deeper move towards a peace treaty, as Margaret's
Spies were giving complete data on the tactical use of the Device, and
it's operating principles.
<P>
This data was revealed in the Journals of former SolSec Co-ordinator Yaela
Nusmit, who is currently the external security minister for the Dingir
League.
