<b>Possible Fates</b>

 

<li> A TED has captured the ship.

<li> Virus got the ship, either infected it, or a Vampire Ship blew it
up.  

<li> The Guild captured or Blew up the ship.  Also been done before.

<li> The Hivers got the Ship.  But why would the Hivers want the ship,
they are supposed to be our friends.  Someone who doesn't not like the Hivers may spread rumors that the Ashtabula has been captured by the Hivers, and that is at one of the Hiver Staging Grounds.  The players try investigate, and get warned away.  Of course the Hivers don't have the ship, but someone wants friction to form between the RC and the Hivers.   

<li> Ship just broke down,and needs repairs, it sits on a distant planet,
trying to build a new jump drive out of a few cocoanuts and chewing
gum.  Kind of dull, but might work for one of the Victrixs

<li>Ship misjumped and is  in another sector, it heroically tries to
fight its way back to the RC, on the way discovering strange new
civilizations.  Well, this is ST:Voyager, would make an interesting
campaign, but doesn't bring around an adventure for the players, again
it might make sense for one of the Victrixs.

<li>The Crew turned traitor and stole the ship, and is now working for a
TED/Solee/Guild or independent pirates.  This is kind of neat, but I
don't think it works for the Ashtubula, it was the Flagship of the
fleet, doesn't seem like they would station anyone but the best on
board. Again maybe one of the other shps.

<li> The ship isn't actually missing, it was sent on a secret mission to
do something or other, so the RC said it was lost.

<li> The Crew found a mission that was more important than the RC, I
don't know, fighting against an ancient enemy from beyond the stars or
something.  Guess I have been watching too much Babylon 5.

<li> The Crew found out a dirty little secret of the RC, or a high
ranking official, and the official sent them off on a suicide mission,
but some members are still alive. Or the official arranged for the ship
to be captured, and killed.
 
<li> The Guild captured or Blew up the ship.  Also been done before.
 
<li>   The Ashtabula might have cottened on to
something and decided what ever it was, was far more important than losing
the scent.  So technically they're awol with a purpose.
 
<li> The Hiver observer on the Ashtabula was really an 
agent for one of the <A HREF="../cari/cari0300.html"> Shadow Nests</A>, and he either sabatoged the
 ship, to destroy RC morale, or prevent them from finding out about
 the Shadow Nests, or maybe they captured the Ashtabula, so they 
could go around pretending to be the RC, and ruin its good name, by 
conducting all sorts of black ops, assasinations, kidnapping,
 pilliaging. You know the normal Smash and Grab operations, but this 
time against nice people, instead of evil TEDs. Maybe the crew is now
 being experimented on by Hivers.
