<B>Lazzerton</B> Subsector-Admiral Natasha Greensdale commanded the Imperial 80th
fleet.  When she heard the news of the Emperor's death she realized that the
Solomani Confederation would take advantage of this weakness. She did not
expect a full scale invasion, but something along the order of a major border raid
and an attempt to grab a few of the more prized worlds along the border.  She
issued orders for the fleet to gather at Merel.  Unknown to her, her Aide-de-camp
was an SolSec agent and he managed to corrupt and delay her orders so that most
of the fleet never arrived at Merel.  She managed to assemble two Batrons and a
Cruron before the Solomani Fleets attacked Merel. When her forward scouts
reported that she was facing an enemy fleet which outnumbered her seven to
one, she issued the order to retreat.  From here she fought here way to Nicosia
Subsector in the Old Expanses. (For more details on Admiral Greensdale
see the history of the Rebellion in <A href="hana7503.html">Nicosia Subsecto</a>r.) There she joined up with the 108th fleet
under the command of Admiral Zklakla. The Reserve Fleet stationed at Marathon was
captured totally intact, and would later be reactivated by the Solomani
Confederation.  A handful of escort destroyers were able to escape and
provide some warning to the fleets in the Old Expanses.<P>


<B>McKenzie</B> Subsector-McKenzie Subsector was defended by the Imperial 313th. When Admiral
Sir Minwan Jones heard the news of the Emperor's death, he assumed that nothing
much would change. He did not think the Solomani would make any agressive moves,
but just in case he sent his squadrons to different border worlds as a show of
force and to provide a defense against any border raids. 
He hoped that this would discourage the Solomani from agression and if it
did not then there would be enough firepower to defeat any raiding parties.
This would have mostly likely worked if the Solomani were launching a simple
border raid, but instead the Solomani attacked with multiple battle fleets.
The individual squadrons of ships were no match for the massed fleets and
almost the entire fleet was either destroyed or captured.<P>

The only capital ship to escape was the <i>Planet</I>-Class Heavy Cruiser the <I>the
Uris Belt</I> (a world in Vland). It managed to escape into Diaspora Sector, where
it joined up with Lucan's forces.  Here it fought with distinction against both
Solomani and Margret's forces.  It managed to survive the war and during the
Hard Times helped provide a small butress against the tides of chaos.<P>
