What destroyed the  <i>Relentless </i> was part of the mystery.  
She'd been ripped appart by 4 kinetic energy impacts.  
Practically snapped the neck off, ripped the starboard wing in
 half, tore through engineering and the upper deck.

The <i>Relentless</i> had fallen victim to a Solomani booby trap.  
In Daibei, Solomani raiders dropped off HK satillites in
to orbit about Gas Giants.  These satilites has primitive 
manouvering thrusters and a very small size, slightly larger 
than 0.5 dp, they were also dirt cheap.  They sat in orbit a
rmed with a 30mm mass driver firing at maximum velocity, and
 a single x-ray det.  They had 30,000 rounds of ammo and would 
fire a 3000 round burst at ships.  They worked at ranges of less
 than one hex.  An because they were solar and battery powered 
they were virtually invisable.  A solomani raider could transmit 
a code and reload the trap at anytime or refuel, everything else 
was a viable target.  <p>

They had 2 hex passives but because eight were required to
 orbit the giant they could link their passives so they could
 watch ships for a while and lay down their barage with a fair 
amount of accuracy. <p>

If they were about to be picked up or out of ammo they'd use 
the x-ray det as a last defence.
