<FONT SIZE=6> <I>Checker</I> Automated Urban Transport   </FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=2>design by <A HREF="../../credits.html#Platte">Kyle Platte</A></FONT><P>


</CENTER>
<HR>
Here's a little machine to throw into Dantor, or any other convenient viral
infestation. It is a civilian transport, easily modifed into an armed
robotic vehicle. Although I hadn't intended it, it works well with the
<a href="vera5017.html"><I>Horrible-Skittery-Spider-Things</I></A>.
They can use this as a transport and cargo
vehicle. It can also provide fire support to defend turf. Finally, they're
so easy to manufacture that they can be made in droves to provide troops.
<P>

The <I>Checker</I> was designed to operate in cities, providing automated passenger
and light cargo transport. The vehicle required no driver, although controls
were available if needed. It was supposed to operate with the local
traffic-control network, with onboard sensors to allow the vehicle some
autonomy outside the city. They were particularly prominent as taxis and
delivery vehicles.
<P>

The <I>Checker</I>'s onboard computer gear made it a convenient ad-hoc weapon for
Viral troops. They were low-tech and easy to produce with little
modification. The factory that produces them was infected and churns out
hundreds of these little cars, so many that their carcasses became a useful
resource for other Virus' forces. Beacuse of their mediocre fighting
performance, several attempts have been made to upgrade their weaponry -- to
little effect. The vehicle lacks the durability to support heavy weapons or
take much damage. Still, it's just fine for mowing down hapless spiderbots,
humans or other <I>Checker</I>s.
<P>
Note the <I>Checker</I> is exceptionally stupid. It tends to follow its commands
literally and to the exception of all else. It is capable of radioing a
supervisor for additional instructions, but rarely does so. The one thing
that the <I>Checker</I> can do exceptionally well is interpret verbal commands to
take a passenger to a known location. It will even respond in a cheery voice
with an ETA and perhaps a jingle for a local hotel.
The current model sports additional weaponry but little else: most still
receive the factory paintjob and transparent plastic dome. Other common
versions mount assorted machineguns and some are simply filled with
explosives and driven into the enemy.

<P>

The vehicle shown here is typical of the Checker designs: it uses the
original vehicle with a small turret replacing the driver's
seat/crewstation. The turret holds the weapon, ammo, robotic brain and IR
sensors: all at TL-9. Cables connect the turret to the vehicle's power,
controls and sensors. In addition, heavy plates have been welded to the
front and rear to allow ramming. Occasionally, spikes and blades are welded
on as well.
<P>
The passenger seats have been removed. Instead, the vehicle can hold an
additional 1250kg of cargo (or spiderbots). Filling this area reduces the
vehicle's performance to the stats listed below.<BR>
Max Speed: 108kph   Travel Move: 465  Combat Move: 45<BR>
The vehicle's body has luggage racks and tie-downs, allowing additional
cargo to be carried, or for adventurous passengers, to hang on to.
While the IR eyes are directional, the radar system has a 360 degree field
of view.<P>
