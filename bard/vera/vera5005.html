  The <I>Omicron</I> Attack Sleds are operated by the Silent Order. This is a 
  mysterious organization operating from the Black Curtain. It hires 
  out Mercenary Armies of robots of several different designs.  It will 
  hire out to Vampire worlds or to worlds that have allied themselves 
  Vampire forces.  They do not accept Imperial credits, which have even 
  less value behind the Black Curtain than they do in the rest of the 
  former Imperium. Instead they trade for raw materials, finished goods, 
  relic equipment, or slaves.  All of these goods are taken behind the 
  Black Curtain for unknown purposes.  Each of the <I>Omicron</I> Attack Sleds 
  is infected with a virus strain.  Most of the Silent Order robots are 
  show evidence of Hostility or Superiority personality types. The Silent 
  Order was recently contacted by Census and Finance of the Sentient Council to
  provide forces to fight against the offworld Badlife which has recently begun 
  supplying arms to the local Badlife.  The Silent Order has agreed to provide 
  13 <I>Omicron</I> Attack Sleds and a supply of fusion rounds and anti-tank missiles.  
  This should provide a impressive force which will allow the Sentient Council 
  to eliminate the threat to Promise.<P>
  
  The <I>Omicron</I> Attack Sled was designed and built inside of the Black Curtain.  
  It was designed as a fast hard hitting attack craft.  It has 4 centimeters 
  of Bonded Super Dense hull, radically sloped in the front and rear to improve 
  the armour's efficency.  It's main armament is twin fusion guns; one mounted 
  on either side of the hull in small turrets.  For use against lightly armored 
  targets, it is equipped with twin grenade launchers. These are mounted in two 
  turrets at the rear of the sled. These launchers fire the standard 4-cm RAM 
  grenades found throughout the wreckage of the former Imperium.  A variety of 
  grenade types ranging from nerve gas, tranq gas, fletchette,  HEAP etc, can be 
  carried depending on the mission and target.  The fusion gun was designed to 
  take out lightly armored opponents; if faced with heavily armored targets such 
  as battle tanks, the <I>Omicron</I> is equipped with four TL-13 laser designated 
  anti-tank missiles.  If these prove ineffective, the high speed of the <I>Omicron</I> 
  should allow it to flee to saftey while heavier units are called into action.
  <P>
  The <I>Omicron</I> has a wide range of sensors that should allow it to seek out 
  and find Badlife targets. Its flight computer is a fiber optic model to protect 
  against EMP damage from PAWS and nuclear weapons. It also is programmed with 
  high skills levels that assist in its missions.  It doesn't have skill with the
  automatic grenade launcher, so the grenade launcher is used against massed 
  enemies, where if a grenade goes off it will still most likely hit a target.  
  Single enemies are targeted by the fusion guns. The <I>Omicron</I> it primarily 
  designed as a hunter/killer of moderately armoured targets, but it is 
  suitable for other missions.  It can be used as a scout or patrol craft, 
  or to capture organic lifeforms with gas grenades.  
  <P>
  While the <I>Omicron</I> is larger than the average security-bot, this gives it 
  several advantages.  It uses the larger of the two TL-13 brains. While this 
  brain is less intelligent, it is far cheaper.  For instance a H9 Heavy Combat
  Robot (from Vampire Fleets pg 83) costs 2.64 MCr of which the brain accounts 
  for 1.91 MCr. The <I>Omicron</I>'s greater size also allows it to carry larger 
  weapons and heavier armor for only a modest increase in price over a H9.  Its
  greater size does increase the possibility of detection, but EMM and decoys 
  help counter this. The <I>Omicron</I> has a 1.6m3 cargo bay; this is useful for 
  carrying other robots into battle, returning captives to base or ferrying 
  supplies to units in the field. The <I>Omicron</I> is truly massive, but 60 tonnes 
  come from the 4 cm thick armour plating it carries. The purchase price of the
  <I>Omicron</I> includes a full load of ammunition and fuel.
