 The Hokhok Missile was designed to be mounted in the specially designed belly slings of the <a href="../sara/sara7017.html"><i>Pandora</i> Class Wild's Freighter</a>.  Powered by the newly developed TL13 Fusion power plant, the Hokhok has been able to acheive a number of G-Turns vastly superior to it's contempararies.
Originally conceived as an armed intelligence drone the Hokhok was quickly modified into an effective search and destroy weapon.  Small enough to pass unnoticed in many systems and possessing respectable stealth capablities the Hokhok is utilized to covertly listen in on ground transmissions while the Freighter maintains a descrete distance and then once the Freighter has decided to land the Hokhok is often left behind to provide high cover.  With its triple warhead system the Hokhok is often simply used as a delivery system for the two smaller warheads thus allowing the larger missile to be simply recovered and utilized again when the time is right.
The Hokhok's only drawback is it's hefty price tag, at close to 4.5 MCr a unit they have yet to be widely embraced by any service.  However, a number of these missiles were recently purchaces by RCES and modified for as yet unknown duties.
