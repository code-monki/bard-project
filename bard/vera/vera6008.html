<b>Name:</B> Adders <BR>
<b>Pill Cost:</B> 25 <BR>
<b>Shot Cost:</B> 50 <BR>
<b>Law:</B> 8 <BR>
<b>Tech:</B> 8 <BR>
<P>

This is a generic name for a group of drugs that temporarily adds to STR, AGL, INT, CON, or MOVE;
each effect requires a different drug. One "dose" adds I point. The effect lasts a few hours; when it
wears off, the affected attribute suffers a penalty equal to the original bonus but lasting twice as long.
<P>

To obtain the effect desired, a user must make a Difficult:CON save (+1 for every additional dose
taken). If the roll is successful, the attribute is raised by the number of doses taken, for a number of
hours equal to the amount by which the CON save was made (one hour if CON is rolled exactly). If the
roll fails, the attribute is raised only by 1 for one hour, regardless of the dose, but the attribute drain
after the hour is up will be as if the entire dosage had been effective.
<P>

Once an Adder has been taken, no different type can be taken until the effects' of the first wear off (or,
wholly unpredictable side effects may occur!). If more of the same Adder is taken within a 24-hour
period, a new CON save is made, at the penalty that would have been required if all those doses had
been taken at once. The good effects, if any, are only that of the new dose, but the letdown period is
extended as though the entire drug had been taken at the time of the latest dose.
<P>

Adder addicts often feel very good under the effects of the drug --- similar to the Overconfident
disadvantage --- and are at least mildly depressed after it wears off.
<P>
In most societies Adders are only available legally to doctors. They are abundant on the black market,
especially around athletes, and are issued routinely to members of military and mercenary organizations.
They come in pill form (takes. 30 minutes to work) or hypo form (works immediately).
 <P>

<b>Name:</B> Antirad <BR>
<b>Pill Cost:</B> 150 <BR>
<b>Shot Cost:</B> 150 <BR>
<b>Law:</B> 9 <BR>
<b>Tech:</B> 9 <BR>
<P>
This medication contains a number of different drugs, with the combined effect of partial protection
against radiation. Antirad can be taken before radiation exposure (up to a week before), or within an
hour after exposure. One dose halves the effective amount of rads from a new exposure; two doses will
halve exposure again, and so on.
<P>
An antirad user must roll a Difficult:CON, plus the number of doses taken within the past week. A
failure causes the permanent loss 1 point of AGL.
<P>
Antirad does not heal radiation damage, it prevents it. It comes in injectable and pill form (both take 30
minutes to work).
<P>


<b>Name:</B> Ascepaline <BR>
<b>Pill Cost:</B> -<BR>
<b>Shot Cost:</B> 150 <BR>
<b>Law:</B> 8 <BR>
<b>Tech:</B> 9 <BR>
<P>
This drug instantly restores all HP to its full level, no matter how much damage the victim has taken (as
long as he�s still conscious when he takes the drug). However, the user must make a Difficult:CON save
(+1 per previous dose in combat) to minimize the drugs side effects. While under the influence of this
drug, both STR and AGL are at -2 (INT is unaffected) for a number of hours equal to the amount by
which he fails his roll plus 2 hours (minimum two hours). (Ascepaline does not attach severed limb or
regenerate nerve tissue, it just gives the user back his entire hit points.)
<P>
It comes in hypo form only.
<P>
<b>Name:</B> Crediline<BR>
<b>Pill Cost:</B> 100  <BR>
<b>Shot Cost:</B> 100 <BR>
<b>Law:</B> 7 <BR>
<b>Tech:</B> 8 <BR>
<P>
This drug makes the user more likely to believe anything he is told. While the drug is in effect, the user's
INT is at 1/4 normal, and suffers the Gullibility disadvantage. The effects last for one hour, minus five
minutes for each point the user made his Difficult:CON save. Extra doses extend the duration by five
minutes each.
<P>
While Crediline is in effect, the user feels very happy; everything around him makes sense, and
everyone is a trusted friend. After the drug wears off, the user must, roll a Difficult:INT save, at +1 per
additional dose taken, or suffer from paranoia, for one hour per dose taken.
<P>
The drug is usually unavailable to anyone except. psychiatric doctors, who can utilize it in therapy. It is
available on the black market, and police and intelligence agencies sometimes use it; it is also, fairly
effective as a truth drug (+4 to Interrogation skill). It comes in pill form (takes five minutes to work) or
in hypo form (which works in 30 seconds).
<P>
<b>Name:</B> Genericillin<BR>
<b>Pill Cost:</B> - <BR>
<b>Shot Cost:</B> 100 <BR>
<b>Law:</B> 8 <BR>
<b>Tech:</B> 10 <BR>
<P>
This is a very powerful, general-purpose antibiotic. It doesn�t treat all Diseases but, it's always a good
thing to try. When an unfamiliar disease is encountered, Genericillin adds 1d6-1 to the effective CON of
anyone' rolling to resist or shake off the disease, taking effect in half an hour. When a new disease is
discovered, record the bonus Genericillin provides to CON, which remains constant for every user
against that specific disease. It adds 4 to CON against most Terran diseases.
<P>
Cumulative doses have no side effects, except that after a few weeks of regular use, the whites of the
eyes become slightly greenish. A dose remains active in the body for about week..
<P>
This drug is guaranteed to be useful for homo-sapains-x only; it is poisonous to most alien species
(although some may have equivalent antibiotics). Available only to licensed physicians and medics,
except when purchased in emergency med kits. It is injectable only.

<P>
<b>Name:</B> Gravanol <BR>
<b>Pill Cost:</B> 70 <BR>
<b>Shot Cost:</B> - <BR>
<b>Law:</B> 11 <BR>
<b>Tech:</B> 9 <BR>
<P>
This drug makes it possible for the: user to function under increased gravity. A dose of Gravanol lasts a
week, and eliminates any medical hazards of two G-increments of extra gravity. This is in addition to the
user's birth planet gravity. Extra doses don�t give extra tolerance.
<P>
Unfortunately, Gravanol is highly addictive. Roll a Formidable:CON after every full week of use, with a
cumulative +I per successive week after the first. Any failed roll means addiction. A Gravanol addict,
needs a dose only weekly, not daily.
<P>
Gravanol comes in pill form only.
<P>

<b>Name:</B> Insta-skill <BR>
<b>Pill Cost:</B> varies<BR>
<b>Shot Cost:</B> varies <BR>
<b>Law:</B> 13 <BR>
<b>Tech:</B> 11 <BR>
<P>
This one of several trade names for a series of tailored injections of modified human memory RNA.
Insta-skill comes in many varieties; each corresponding to a general skill; each dose give the equivalent
of skill 1 in the specific skill (+1 per TL after 11).
<P>
Insta-skill is only available in hypo form. Twenty-four hours after injection (the RNA needs time to
replicate), roll a Difficult:CON save; the effects last for two hours per point the CON save is made by,
with a minimum of I hour.
<P>
Insta-skill costs 500 Cr per dose for a Language skill, 900 Cr for a Knowledge skill, 1,500 for an Active
skill.
<P>
There are no drawbacks to repeated use. At higher tech levels, increase the duration by I hour per point
of success. Rumors exist that there are formulas for permanent skill retention.
<P>


<b>Name:</B> Memory Beta<BR>
<b>Pill Cost:</B>250<BR>
<b>Shot Cost:</B> 250 <BR>
<b>Law:</B> 7 <BR>
<b>Tech:</B> 10 <BR>
<P>
Memory-Beta stimulates the user's memory. After taking a dose of the drug, he can remember ---with
perfect clarity --- nearly anything that has happened to him he concentrates on recalling. A
Formidable:INT roll is required to focus on something specific, and some stimulus is usually required to
recall buried memories. Without guidance, the user will be lost in his own memories, reliving bits and,
pieces of his life.
<P>
The drug�s effects last 2d6 hours; it may require hours of sifting through memories to find the one the
character is looking for, but when the memory does return, it is of crystal clarity. Make an Difficlut:INT
roll every half hour to recall something, with modifiers depending on how accurate or significant that
memory was, recent memories get a -3, while long-forgotten trivia is at +3 or worse.
<P>
The danger of using Memory-Beta lies in becoming lost in memories. Failing a memory roll indicates the
user has become lost in a daze of random recollections (roll Formidable:INT every five minutes to
recover). A critical failure on a memory roll results in the character being captured by some especially
strong memory, whether of joy, tragedy, terror or even birth and triggering buried phobias or, other
psychological traumas. Effects will vary depending on the individual's quirks: psychosis, hysterical
weeping, or anger are all possibilities. Even if not seeking after specific memories, an INT roll is still
required every half-hour; failure and critical failure have the same effects as above.
<P>
Taking more than one dose increases the duration of the drug by one hour per extra dose, but gives a -1
INT on all INT rolls to control the experience.
<P>
Memory-Beta was originally developed as a treatment for some forms of amnesia. The black market
has found other uses for it, students buy it to use during exams, and actors take it to recall their lines.
Criminal, military and intelligence organizations also use it; the drug makes debriefings go more
smoothly, and when injected into a subject along with Crediline or some other "truth serum" it greatly
facilitates interrogations (an additional +3 to skill) --- the subject remembers things in enough detail to
satisfy the most methodical interrogator.
<P>
          Memory-Beta comes in pill form (taking effect in thirty minutes) and hypo form (takes effect
          instantly).
<P>



<b>Name:</B> Neurovine <BR>
<b>Pill Cost:</B> - <BR>
<b>Shot Cost:</B> 30 <BR>
<b>Law:</B> 10 <BR>
<b>Tech:</B> 8 <BR>
<P>
This is an antidote for nerve poison. If taken within 15 minutes of poisoning, a Neurovine injection adds
+3 to CON on rolls to avoid taking further damage. Note that Neurovine is itself dangerous; taking more
than one dose in a day does 3d6 damage if a Formidable:CON save is failed, 1d6 if the roll successful. It
is only available as an injection. Military units issue Neurovine as part of every soldier's first-aid kit.
<P>


<b>Name:</B> Purge <BR>
<b>Pill Cost:</B> 20 <BR>
<b>Shot Cost:</B> 20 <BR>
<b>Law:</B> 12 <BR>
<b>Tech:</B> 10 <BR>
<P>
Purge cleanses the users system of foreign biochemicals, neutralizing any active drugs (including
recreational drugs and alcohol) within 2d6 minutes --- if the user makes an Average:CON save. Failure
means that the dose had no effect (though additional doses of Purge may); critical failure means it has
also nauseated the user (AGL-3 for I hour),
<P>
If more than one dose of Purge is taken within 24 hours, CON saves are at CON-2 per extra dose, as the
user's system becomes temporarily immune to the drug.
<P>
The drug will not counteract drug addiction or cure lasting side effects (such as lost attribute points) that
remain after the drug wears off. Purge has no effect on TL11+ drugs or most deadly poisons, but it will
counteract sleep or paralysis gas.
<P>
Purge is safe, usually legal, and is sometimes used as a "sobriety pill" by those who can afford it. It
comes in pill or injectable form.
<P>


<b>Name:</B> Quickheal (Stimpak) <BR>
<b>Pill Cost:</B> 20<BR>
<b>Shot Cost:</B> 50 <BR>
<b>Law:</B> 11 <BR>
<b>Tech:</B> 9 <BR>
<P>
A dose of this drug will heal 1d8 HP (+ MedTech skill) of any type of wound damage, in the affected
area. Although this drug works instantly in hypo form and is a free action to use, during combat
accessing the drug in your inventory is a simple action, or a complex action if programming a Medipak in
Power Armor. It has no effect on Hp's lost to radiation, disease or poison,
<P>
Quickheal can be found in most first aid. and medical pouches. It may be purchased legally by anyone on
free worlds, and by doctors or through prescription on most others. It is abundant on the black market
even on worlds where it is for some reason illegal.
<P>

<b>Name:</B> Quickheal II<BR>
<b>Pill Cost:</B> 50 <BR>
<b>Shot Cost:</B> 150 <BR>
<b>Law:</B> 7 <BR>
<b>Tech:</B> 11 <BR>
<P>
An improved version of Quickheal, a dose of this drug will heal 1d10 HP (+ MedTech skill) of any type
of wound damage, in the affected area. However, because of the drug's evasive and system harshness,
after combat is over the user will take I d4/2 points of damage per dose used. This drug works instantly
in hypo form and is a free action to use, during combat accessing the drug in your inventory is a simple
action, or a complex action if programming a Medipak in Power Armor. It has no effect on Hp's lost to
radiation, disease or poison.
<P>
        It is abundant on the black market.
<P>


<b>Name:</B> Rage <BR>
<b>Pill Cost:</B> - <BR>
<b>Shot Cost:</B> 40 <BR>
<b>Law:</B> 5 <BR>
<b>Tech:</B> 8 <BR>
<P>
A dose of this drug gives the user double STR and the Berserk disadvantage for Id6 x 10 melees. The
drug requires 2 melee rounds to take effect. After it wears off the user will be shaky and nervous; -1 on
INT and AGL for as long as he was on Rage.
<P>
Cumulative doses may extend the effect's duration and will also extend the duration of the side effects.
Rage has one other disadvantage: 1d6 hours after use the user must roll a Formidable:CON save or
suffer a "flashback" to the drug effects, becoming berserk for I d6 melees (but without double STR!)
and then suffering nerves and shakiness.
<P>
Licensed physicians for psychotherapy sometimes use rage; otherwise it is only found on the black
market.
<P>


<b>Name:</B> Shaker <BR>
<b>Pill Cost:</B> - <BR>
<b>Shot Cost:</B> 25 <BR>
<b>Law:</B> 2 <BR>
<b>Tech:</B> 10 <BR>
<P>
Shaker is a slang name for CHKR-57, an experimental neurotransmitter enhancer developed as part of
a project to produce a safe and effective enhancement drug for combat that was cheaper to produce than
Tempo. They were almost successful: Shaker is cheap
and effective, but it isn't safe.
<P>
After a dose is taken, there is no effect for a number of seconds equal to users CON. Then, every 15
seconds over the next minute increase CON, STR and AGL by 1 point and decrease INT by 2 points.
The user will feel fine, even supercharged, and barely aware of the fact; that he can�t even perform
simple addition anymore. He gains the Overconfident disadvantage and does not feel pain.
<P>
Troops on Shaker can be given an order before the drug is taken (or on an Impossible:INT save, give
themselves an order). The order should be simple, twenty words or less (�keep walking north and kill
any enemies you see!'). To do anything else (such as dodging, taking cover, or healing yourself) not
specifically covered by, the order requires an Impossible:INT save --- at the user's, new current INT.
<P>
Shaker lasts for 20 -(CON save) hours(for a minimum of 1 hour). Other than turning its user into a
gung-ho idiot for several hours, Shaker has no side effects. Additional doses within 24 hours have no
effect.<P>

A dose of Shaker only costs 20 Cr to produce and is only available to authorized military personnel;
black market prices can go as high as 100 Cr. It is injectable only. Shaker and Tempo can be combined.
<P>

<b>Name:</B> Suspend<BR>
<b>Pill Cost:</B> - <BR>
<b>Shot Cost:</B> 650 <BR>
<b>Law:</B> 8 <BR>
<b>Tech:</B> 9 <BR>
<P>
Suspend slows down all biological functions. Thus, it can keep a badly injured person alive longer. If it is
injected into a dying person, it will retard cell death (but it must be injected before the heart stops!). A
person injected with Suspend (even if he died after the injection) can be treated or frozen. He won't heal
at all while on the drug, but he won�t get any worse either.
<P>
Suspend takes effect in one minute; its effects last 48 hours, after which the metabolism returns to
normal and deterioration of the body begins again. Each subsequent dose requires a Difficult:CON save.
When a save is failed, that dose is ineffective and Suspend will not work on those person for (30 - CON)
days. Injection more than one dose at a time have no additional effect.
<P>

<b>Name:</B> Tempo <BR>
<b>Pill Cost:</B> - <BR>
<b>Shot Cost:</B> 40 <BR>
<b>Law:</B> 4 <BR>
<b>Tech:</B> 10 <BR>
<P>
Tempo is a reliable and reasonably safe combat drug. It works by altering the users time sense, so that
everything around him (including both his own actions and those of others) seem to be happening
extremely slowly. Since the users mind is left clear, this gives him time to react to other people�s
movement --- he can see a blow coming, for example, and think about the best way to block it, or predict
the course of his target.
<P>
Tempo's main, effect is to give the user, "Combat Reflexes" ;---he gets 1d6 to defense and initiative, +2
on morale checks, +3 on INT to recover from surprise or mental stunning, and double actions during
combat turns (i.e. 4 simple actions or 2 complex actions per combat action!). The drug's effects last for
one minute times the amount the user makes a Difficult:CON save by (minimum, of I minute). The only
side effect is that its use rapidly exhausts the user, leaving him a nervous-wreck. After the drug wears,
the user takes two fatigue levels and loses 1d4 INT and AGL; AGL and INT losses wear off in four
hours if no further doses were taken by then. Additional doses of Tempo have no effect until the drug
wears off, except to increase the amount of Fatigue loss.
<P>
A dose of Tempo only costs 40 Cr to produce and is, only available to authorized military personnel,
black market prices can go as high as 1,000 Cr. It is injectable only.
<P>
<b>Name:</B> Anagathic Regimen <BR>
<b>Cost:</B> 85,000 <BR>
<b>Law:</B> 12 <BR>
<b>Tech:</B> 10 <BR>
<P>
The anagathic regimen is a series of chemical treatments that slow the physical effects of aging. In most
patients, the aging process is slowed for one-half or even one-third normal, theoretically doubling or
tripling the adult life span. But the procedure is new enough (approved for public use in 750 TI) that,
long-term data does not yet exists. The anagathic regimen is very expensive; only the very wealthy can
afford to maintain it for long periods of time.
<P>
A dose of anagathics is actually a set of two injections and six pills, all of which must be taken within a
day's time. Each anagathic treatment remains effective for an average of eight months, during which
time the subject ages approximately two months. When a character undergoes his first anagathic
treatment, roll 2d8-2 for the number of months that the treatment will remain in effect, then roll 1d4-1 for
the number of months aged during that period. The effects of any future treatments will be identical. (It
should be noted that in 0. 5 percent of the population the anagathic regimen has no effect, and in 1.9
percent it actually speeds the aging proms.)
<P>
Unfortunately, once an individual stops taking the drugs, he must make up all the aging rolls he skipped,
at a rate of one roll per week. Thus, he rapidly ages to his actual chronological rate, which often results
in death.
<P>

<b>Name:</B> Psi-Booster <BR>
<b>Pill Cost:</B> 1000 <BR>
<b>Shot Cost:</B> 1500 <BR>
<b>Law:</B> 2 <BR>
<b>Tech:</B> 9 <BR>
<P>
The basic psi-drug, booster is available in pill form (takes effect in 30 minutes) or hypo form (takes
effect immediately). Booster temporarily increases an individual's PSI level by +2. Additional doses of
booster have no effect if taken by a character within an hour. The drug-induced increase will wan and
disappear at the end of one hour.
<P>


<b>Name:</B> Psi-Double <BR>
<b>Pill Cost:</B> 2000 <BR>
<b>Shot Cost:</B> 2500 <BR>
<b>Law:</B> 2 <BR>
<b>Tech:</B> 10 <BR>
<P>
A more potent-form of Booster, identical in duration and time effectiveness, Double boosts PSI levels by
+4.
<P>

<b>Name:</B> Psi-Special <BR>
<b>Pill Cost:</B> - <BR>
<b>Shot Cost:</B> 10,000 <BR>
<b>Law:</B> 2 <BR>
<b>Tech:</B> 11 <BR>
<P>
The rarest of psi-drugs, Special is available only hypo form. Special gradually increases PSI levels to 12,
at the rate of 1 point per hour. PSI remains at this level for 24 hours, and then wanes at the rate of I point
per hour until PSI reaches a temporary level of 0. The skill levels then returns at the rate of 1 per hour
until the character's current level is reached, so long as no psionic activity is performed during this
recovery period.
<P>
Special has some dangers. Roll a Difficult:INT save each time it is used. On a critical failure, reduce PSI
by 1 level .
<P>


<b>Name:</B> Dikote <BR>
<b> Cost:</B> 10,000/100 cm<sup>2</sup> <BR>
<b>Law:</B> 8<BR>
<b>Tech:</B> 9 <BR>
<P>
While not actually a drug, Dikote is a chemical process that deposits a thin diamond film on any solid
surface. Small volumes of methane gas are mixed with large volumes of hydrogen gas, then subjected to
powerful beams of microwave energy. This creates plasma, a super-hot gas in which all atoms are
ionized. The plasma is then passed over the cooler solid target, forming a diamond film as the gases
condense on the surface.
<P>
The diamond film imparts much more structural strength and resilience to conventional materials, adding
+4 to the Structural/Barrier Rating, and +1 DF level to any armor present. When Dikote is used to coat
a melee weapon, the Damage level is increased by +2. Parrying with a Dikote-treated object adds an
additional +2 to the die roll. Edged weapons with Dikote can inflict damage against "hardened" (i.e.
vehicular) targets. When so used, these weapons reduce the Damage level by - 1. Unfortunately, not
everything can be glazed with Dikote. The item treated must be able to withstand the heat generated by
the plasma. This obviously eliminates cloth and plastic, which comprise the bulk of casual armor.
<P>


<b>Name:</B> Hyper<BR>
<b>Pill Cost:</B> - <BR>
<b>Shot Cost:</B> 200 <BR>
<b>Law:</B> 2 <BR>
<b>Tech:</B> 8 <BR>
<P>
Hyper is a direct neural stimulator, acting on the nerves connected to the temporal and occipital lobes of
the brain. These sections of the brain interpret most nervous sensations, including taste, smell, sound,
and sight. The drug known as hyper artificially produces the effects of hyperaesthesia, a condition of
excessive sensitivity to sensory stimuli, resulting in pain from even the most minor of sensations. A tap,
for example, feels like a sharp blow, a whisper becomes a shout, and so on.
<P>
Upon initial exposure, the victim suffers a 4d4 attack and mild vertigo (apply a -1 to all target numbers).
Following exposure, the victim makes a Difficult:CON save; each success subtracts 5 minutes from the
drug's normal 60-minute effect. During this period, the individual is bombarded with intensely magnified
sensations. All concentration tasks attempted in this period add -4 to their target numbers ; any damage
taken will result in an additional 4d4 damage because of sensory overload.
<P>


<b>Name:</B> Kamikaze <BR>
<b>Pill Cost:</B> - <BR>
<b>Shot Cost:</B> 50 <BR>
<b>Law:</B> 3 <BR>
<b>Tech:</B> 10 <BR>
<P>
Kamikaze is a tailored amphetamine, and is a combat drug. It has been used as a battle drug in various
forms since the 900s, despite knowledge of addictive and destructive nature.
<P>
In moderate doses, Kamikaze can give users an edge, somewhat equalizing the odds when unaugmented
(either biologically or cybernetically) individuals face augmented opponents in combat. As use continues
and addiction grows, the user requires larger doses and adverse side effects begin to manifest. Large
doses can cause excitement, tremors, momentary euphoria, and dilated pupils. Excess doses (bordering
on overdose level) cause anxiety, hallucinations, and uncontrolled muscular movements. Even higher
dosages leads quickly to death.
<P>
Used as a battle stimulant, Kamikaze adds +2 CON, +2 AGL, +4 STR, +2 Willpower, and +2d6 to
calculated Initiative. It will also negate the first 4 damage attacks received. The effects of Kamikaze last
anywhere from 10 to 60 melees (10 x 1d6), depending on body chemistry.
<P>
The repeated use of Kamikaze has a destructive effect on the user's metabolism. On top of the regular
effects of overuse, with every four doses of the drug the user must make 2 Difficult:CON saves. The
first is a normal save to resist addiction and/or resistance to current dose(failure indicates addiction
and/or increasing the dosage by 1). The second save is made at CON (-1 for every 4 doses taken) to
avoid physiological effects of the drug (failure indicates the permanent loss of 1 point of both INT and
CON). This physical and mental "wasting" will eventually kill a character who intends long-term use of
Kamikaze, In addition, Kamikaze permanently alters the bioneurological functions of the subject's body.
After a number of uses equal to half the users CON (round down), the character's bioware and
cyberware will no longer function.
<P>
Despite Kamikaze�s many drawbacks, several institutions and companies in various parts of the
Imperium still use it as a cheap alternative to mass troop biological or cybernetic augmentation. A dose
of Kamikaze only costs 50 Cr to produce and is only available to authorized military personnel; black
market prices can go as high as 10,000 Cr. It is injectable only. Shaker and Tempo cannot be combined
with Kamikaze.
