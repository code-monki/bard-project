The <I>BriarRose</I> Self Propelled gun is based on the <a href="vera3009.html"><I>Sunfire</I> tank</a> chassis.  It replaces the <I>Sunfire's</I> 9cmL100 cannon with a 15cmL100 cannon which is placed in a small turret at the back of the vehicle.  To make room for the larger gun, the <I>Sunfire's</I> additional front armor was removed, as was the rear slope.  The weight freed up by the removal of the armor allows the <I>BriarRose</I> to carry 14 tons of ammunition.

The <I>BriarRose</I> is equipped with a 15cmL100 hypervelocity cannon firing rocket assisted propulsion (RAP) rounds.  The RAP rounds and the extremely long barrel give the <I>BriarRose</I> a 75km indirect fire range.  The <I>BriarRoses</I> often operate in conjunction with a TL-15 Marine Fire Direction Control APC, which coordinates and directs their fire.
<P>
A coaxial automatic grenade launcher provides a defensive capability against enemy personnel, and against targets too close to be engaged with the main gun.  It fires standard 4cm RAM grenades.  It has four switchable magazines that allow it to switch between four types of ammunition with no delay.  These are usually, HE, HEAP, Flettchette and White Phosphorus.  The HEAP rounds allow it to engage lightly armored vehicles and bunkers.  <P>


The vehicle is equipped with the <a href="vera7602.html"><I>Shooting Star</I> </a>defensive system.  A computer controlled rotary gun  equipped with a a state of the art point defense computer is capable of destroying incoming artillery rounds, missiles etc.  This along with 10 decoys gives the <I>BriarRose</I> increased survivability on the battlefield.
<P>

The vehicle has two full sized computers, which reduce the maintenance demands by a factor of four. Though expensive these computers drastically reduce the upkeep cost of the vehicles over their projected lifetime.  They also provide large amounts of computing power to aid the crew.   This aid includes enhanced image processing, threat analysis, and tactical surveys.  None of the recent Solee designs have command versions.  Modifying vehicles for command, makes it possible to identify those single out those vehicles, and if the command vehicle is taken out, then the second in command has fewer resources to command the unit with.  Instead Solee provides all of its vehicles with communication systems capable of interfacing with orbiting support craft.  The full sized computers also provide assistance the commander.
