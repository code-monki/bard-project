<P>
     The <i>Golem</I> is a purpose-built STOL attack aircraft made on
Luhtal, using local technology. Inspired by the ancient Solomani
<I>Thunderbolt</I> II and <I>Frogfoot</I> designs, it incorporates higher tech
than these aircraft, without using technologies that the planet
would have to import. <P>

     It is a two-seat design, with the weapons officer sharing
flight duties when needed on long missions. With the capability
of 14-hour missions with its drop tanks, this is a necessity.
Standard armament are the TL 7 anti-aircraft and anti-armor
missiles common to the low-tech RC worlds and the wilds (RCEG, p.
108), as well as a 3 cm/75 six-barreled autocannon built into the
fuselage, that uses APFSDSDU ammunition for the anti-armor role.
It has an internal fuel supply of 7 hours for its HBT turbines,
and 14 hours for its onboard fuel cells (the cost and weight of a
MHD turbine was considered excessive for the design). With the
wing drop tanks, flight time is increased to 14 hours - enough
for a 3000 km mission radius under the right conditions.
Furthermore, the <i>Golem</I> is capable of in-flight refueling, making
the drop tanks optional. <P>

     It is also extremely maneuverable, having a full 30% of its
mass dedicated to maneuverability. Its minimum flight speed more
befits a biplane than a TL 8 aircraft with 4 tonnes of thrust.
Its high agility lets it turn on the proverbial dime, with 9
cents change. Even loaded up to its maximum take-off weight, it
only requires a 400 meter runway for its take-off roll. <P>

     There are several variants and prototypes. The original
prototype had 6 tons of thrust; a side-effect of trying to
generate more power through the flight systems, and reducing the
size of the fuel cell. However, this option was considered
unfeasible, as it so severely overpowered the plane as to
endanger its structural integrity. The one major variant (stats
not given here) replaces the outer wing tri-bomb/missile racks
with multi-racks, for a total payload of 36 missiles, 48 if the
drop tanks are not used. This variant is generally meant for use
against TL 4 & TL 5 foes by RCES forces, as both an attack AND
air superiority aircraft against the subsonic aircraft used by
these worlds. <P>

     Also in the works is a TL 9 variant of the fighter the 
	 <A HREF="vera0024.html"><I>Golem</I>-B</A>, with
upgraded systems and an HBT replacing the fuel cells. This
version will be a joint venture between the Luhtalan manufacturer
and a minor Oriflamme aircraft manufacturer seeking to expand its
operations. The latter was not originally enthused with the
prospect of a business venture with the Luhtalans, until its
owner got a chance to fly one of the standard <i>Golem</I>s, and was so
impressed with the design that the usual Centrist/Federalist
rivalries took a back seat to the desire to build such a well-
rounded design.  
  
   <P>
  An uncommon variant  (<I>Golem</I> A) uses multi-bomb/missile
 racks on all the ordnance hard points, for a total of 36 or 48
 missiles
 (the latter if the drop tanks are not used). This variant is
 slightly
 heavier in its dry weight, and has more drag points. However, it
 was built to serve both attack and air superiority roles for RC
assistance on TL 4 & TL 5 worlds.<P>
