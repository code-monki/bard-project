 The Hell Hound was an Imperial-era design for a security robot.  The Hell Hound
	was shaped in the form of a large predator animal.  The surface of the robot
	was contoured and had an organic shape to it.  Normally Hell Hounds were
	a dark gun metal color, but the factory would color the robots other colors
	for a small additional fee.  The Hell Hound was outfitted with a large suite
	of sensors enabling it to detect intruders.  These include high-resolution thermal
	eyes with a range of 300 meters through all atmospheric conditions other than snow
	or rain, where it was only 150 meters.  It also has sonar ears, high and low
	frequency ears and a ultrasonic motion detector.  These senses allow the Hell Hound
	to detect intruders in almost all conditions.  The Hell Hound can keep in touch
	with its home base and other units via a short range radio. The Hell Hound
	also has recording ears and eyes, so that a full record of its actions is kept.
	This is useful for legal prosecutions.  There have been some cases where
	unscrupulous individuals have used Hell Hound units to hunt down individuals
	and broadcast the hunt live to spectators as entertainment.
<P>
	Unlike many security robots, the Hell Hound is not armed with a firearm, but rather
	powerful jaws. These jaws will not do much versus armored opponents, but the
	Hell Hound was not intended as a warbot, mearly as a sophisticated guard. If the
	Hell Hound encounter's armored individuals, it can contact either its owner or
	the police, depending on the owner's wishes.  Its high armor value, should allow
	it to survive long enough for the police to arrive.  In the mean time it can
	keep the police up to date on the intruder's whereabouts and actions.
