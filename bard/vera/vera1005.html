<P>
This is a TL-8 wheeled APC, roughly similar to SISU-PASI, but equipped
with better engine (TL-8 rotapower Wankel), larger fuel tank and
composite armor. The APC is used as bullet/fragment resistant troop
tansport, and relies more on speed and manouverability than armor. 
   <P>
   
There are no sensor systems other than headlights, but just about
anything can be installed.
<P>
The maximum groundspeed is calculated using realistic model based on
atmospheric drag, wheelsystem rolling resistance and transmission
losses. The wheels are large "tractor wheels".
<P>
There are 3 firing ports on each side and one in rear door.
<P>
The driver and front passenger sit side-by side at the front, and the
remaining 6 passenger are at rear. Engine is compartment is behind the
driver. The passenger seats are build-in part of the internal wall and
the rear cabin can be loaded with passengers or cargo without any
modifications. If passenger remain standing, it is possible to cram in
12 passengers (personal weapons only, no backpacks) for short trips.
The internal roof is fitted with fabric loops so that the passenger can
hang on them during cross-country driving.
<P>
The vehicle is fully amphibious, and moves on water by rotating wheels
at ~10 km/h. (SISU-PASI has auxiliary water propulsion, but I could not
find enough data to use it in this vehicle.)
<P>
The vehicle has a turret-ring which can be fitted with various weapon
systems. Small turrets and pintle-mounted guns have no effect on
performance, but is a large turret is fitted (Marksman, AMOS), the hull
volume must be re-calculated.
<P>
When used as IFV or Anti-tank role, the vehicle is usually fitted with
KBP's "Kliver" combination turret, which contains quad launcher for
"Kornet" anti-tank missiles, 30 mm autocannon (fires 4000 rounds in
minute) and 7.62 mm machine gun. The stabilized aiming system contains
thermal imager and laser ranging unit.
<P>
With fully-loaded AMOS-2 turret (twin 120 mm autoloaded mortars with 
full stabilization; can launch "Strix" missiles; capable of direct fire) 
the vehicle hull volume is 2 td, mass rises to ~11.5 tons, and 
groundspeeds drop to 141 km/h (road), 124 km/h (ground) and 46 km/h 
(sand).
