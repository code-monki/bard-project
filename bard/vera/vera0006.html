        Constructed of wood and canvas or similar materials, the 
<i>Paper Kite</I> represents the lowest tech fixed-wing aircraft possible.
The aircraft is a biplane, with the engine (driving a single large
"pusher" 
propellor) at the rear of the fuselage, mounted between twin booms 
which support the tailplane. The crew of two are provided with rather 
cramped positions in the fuselage - the pilot sits above and behind 
the gunner/observer, who mans the aircraft's single ring-mounted LMG. 
Despite it's armament, the <i>Paper Kite</I> is not really designed for 
combat - it is intended to be used more for artillery spotting and 
scouting. It is difficult to use as a ground attack aircraft, the 
machine gun being unsuitable for strafing, but in extremis it can be 
pressed into service, the observer/gunner throwing hand-grenades over 
the side of the cockpit. Because of its slow speed and low agility, 
the <i>Paper Kite</I> easily falls prey to any aircraft purpose-built for 
combat.<P>
        Due to the aircraft's flimsy construction and lack of sensors 
it can only be used in daylight, and then only if the weather allows 
it. While it is theoreticly possible to navigate the craft at night 
or in bad weather using the compass, airspeed indicator and maps, it 
is a risky prospect at best, and in any case landing is virtually 
impossible in darkness or low cloud.<P>
        One advantage of the <i>Paper Kite</I> and it's low-tech brethren 
over other, more advanced craft is that they can take off and land 
virtually anywhere - "airfields" for these craft are often just empty 
paddocks or converted sports grounds.<P>
 
 The plane was designed with <I> Fire Fusion & Steel</I>.<P>
