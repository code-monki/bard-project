The <I>Reaver</I> battledress was the standard Imperial heavy battledress, used by Imperial Marines and several other elite units. In the
final days of the Third Imperium it was one of the preeminent symbols of Imperial power -- and oppression.
The <I>Reaver</I> is a massive`, bulky suit designed to provide heavy protection and limited autonomy from support lines. The suits
were designed to perform the tasks dictated to Marines of the day: boarding actions, orbital drop and starport securing attacks. Its
intimidating size and strength also helped in the Marines' unofficial job of suppressing discontent.
The armor will support its operator for 96 hours before requiring maintenance or power.
The <I>Reaver</I> does not carry any internal weapons, leaving weapon load to individual and unit preference. In addition, the basic suit
carries only limited sensors and communications gear. A large "Battle Pak" is normally fitted to the suit, which greatly increases
its functionality. The Battle Pak is listed below the description of the armor.

All of the suit's systems are ruggedized for combat and will function without maintenance for at least the four-day operational
period.

The suit is comprised of two layers: the heavy powered external armor, and a lighter armored skinsuit underneath.
The skinsuit is made of ballistic weave integrated with a solid-state cooling system. It skinsuit also incorporates a load-support
harness and all the couplings for joining to the outer shell and life-support. The suit covers the entire body except the face and
acts as a self-sealing vacc suit when coupled with a facemask/helmet and PLSS. The skinsuit, if worn alone, has an armor value of
1.
The outer shell is built around a powered skeleton encased by BSD plates. The suit's power, life support and electronics are all
fitted in the outer shell. When sealed, the outer shell forms a second airtight layer.
<P>
The armor incorporates an advanced PLSS that provides a comfortable operating environment in a wide variety of conditions. The
PLSS includes air tanks for the full 96 hours but also allows for filtered breathing to conserve onboard supplies. The suit can be
recharged and resupplied while the operator is inside without requiring the seals to be broken.
<P>
The suit's radio operates in frequency-agile bursts, transmitting brief pulses rather that remaining on an open line. This saves
power and makes radio traffic more difficult to detect and intercept. However, it prevents the continuous stream of data needed for
live targeting and real-time tactical displays. Such options can be performed (see below) at the expense of battery life.
<P>
The suit has power to operate the actuators, life support and internal electronics for 96 hours. The suit's functions are controlled
by an integral fibre-optic computer equivalent to a hand-computer. It incorporates an inertial tracker and can communicate with
other suits and base stations to generate tactical maps for the wearer. When used in combat, it will allow for real-time locations of
allied forces to be displayed in the helmet, although this puts a serious strain on the radio's batteries. The computer can also
accept data through IGS positions satellites to determine the suit's location. Attached to the computer is a basic medical system
that monitors the wearer's vital signs and will inject a variety of drugs on command. The medical system will automatically inject
drugs in an attempt to resuscitate a target, but it has no other diagnostic abilities. Drugs can also be keyed externally through a
keypad on the right arm.

This is a package of electronic gear to be fitted to the <I>Reaver</I> battledress. It consists of two main units: a CG flight system and an
expanded sensor suite. These units can also be extensively modified in the field to allow for greater tactical ability.
The CG harness will largely negate the gravitic field around the armor, allowing it to scale or bound over large obstacles. The grav
system allows the operator to function in a "gravity-hostile" environment, such as a high-G world or to counter the use of artificial
gravity as a weapon. The system also incorporates a small HEPlaR thruster that allows the wearer to maneuver the suit. This
allows for limited flight in atmosphere or the ability to maneuver in space. The suit has a top flying speed of 300 kph and one of
the computers is dedicated to operating the flight system. The operator is warned that the suit does not have any inherent NOE
ability other that what the operator brings. Test operators have described the suit's flight profile as a "rocket-brick."
The CG flight pack has fuel and power for 2 hours of continuous use.
 <P>
The second system incorporates a 10km PEMS to allow the operator some basic observational skills. In addition, the Battle Pak
can be detached and left separately as a remote sensor. It will transmit sensor data via radio, allowing units to form a sensor
perimeter with its Battle Paks. The Pak can also be combined with remote-detonated mines and guided missiles to act as an
automated ambusher. The on-board computer handles the sensor data and can be programmed with a variety of target priorities
for its use as a remote sentry. The radio operates in the same frequency-agile burst mode as the suit radio. The unit also
incorporates a small area jammer to defend against enemy sensors.
The sensors, jammer and radio will operate for 12 hours continuously before running
