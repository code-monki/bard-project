<P>
Bio gel, also called bio-thermal gel is a nutrient-rich, arreated,
organic substance which evenly distributes the heat produced by objects
which it surrounds.  It has half the density of water and can also be
used as a nutrient pathway for living tissue.
<P>
Bio gel was originally created as an aid in tissue research.  It is most
commonly found in large healing vats, where it helps speed the healing
process (in game terms, healing is three times faster for as long as the
wounds are completely submersed for at least 24 hours).  It is also used
to maintain natural, organic skin which covers cybernetic limbs.  In
these functions, a small electrical AC charge is constantly applied
<P>
Bio gel has a usable life of 24 hours per litre, after which the gel
begins to dry into small darkened lumpy masses which inhibit the
conduction of the electricity needed to distribute nutrients unless
removed.
<P>
Bio gel can be manufactured using the proper raw materials (found in
certain combinations of food products) and a standard TL 10 fuel
processing plant.  The by-products of this are a green, pasty sludge and
50ml of water per 3kg of materials.
