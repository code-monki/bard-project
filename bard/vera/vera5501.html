Anyhow, this is the standard BattleDress for the New Earth Republic.
(For Details on the NER, see the Rim League on the 
<A HREF="../bardperi.html"> Peri</A> page)
It contains many electronic goodies, and some integral weapons.  The
thing is capable of carrying 24kg of "Cargo" (ie equipment) without
slowing down.  The thing is powered by a fuel cell, so it has good 
endurance, and can be refueled with LHyd in no-time flat.  Of course
if you run out of Hydrocarb distillates, you better hope you have some
cheap whiskey, some replacement catalysts, and a VERY understanding
technical crew.....
<P>
Anyhow, compared to RCES Light Battledress:
Lighter, Heavier Armor, more goodies, greater endurance, integral 
weapons, and Cheaper too....Of course it doesn't have WSV goggles, and
it can't be repowered from a plug socket, but oh well.  With the fuel
being only 3.65kg of LHyd, it is rather small, and light.  Heck, with
some of the empty space you could give it a week's fuel.
