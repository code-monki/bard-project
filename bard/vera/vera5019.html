<FONT SIZE=6>A(P)-11 Assassination Robot   </FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=2>by Brendan O'Donovan</A></FONT><p>


</CENTER>
<HR>

This robot was designed for deep security penetration and assassination
missions. Externally the robot appears human, although fairly heavily built,
and the robot can appear convincingly human in simple dialogue, although while
it is fluent in all major languages, it is not an amazing conversationalist.
Power consumption was a problem for the designers and one of the robot's major
weaknesses is its extremely limited endurance. For long insertion missions the
robot often carries additional fuel supplies, but for most purposes the robot's
endurance is sufficient.<P>
The robot is designed for stealth and it's synthetic skin incorporates a
chameleon surface which can render it practically invisible when it remains
still for 1D20 combat rounds. EMM masking underneath the skin can hide the
robot from IR sensors, or be used to produce an IR signature which matches a
human.<P>
The robot's internal armament consists of a large bore gauss weapon which fires
rounds at 300m/s, inaudible beyond a few feet and producing no muzzle flash.
For a graduated response the robot carries internally two switchable magazines,
one carrying conventional rounds, and another carrying HEAP rounds for
situations where stealth can be compromised in exchange for increased striking
power.<P>
	The soluble rounds consist of a discarding sabot which is retained within the
	weapon, and a biodegradeable polymer bullet which contains bacteria which are
	released on impact, digesting the bullet within an hour. These rounds were
	designed to intimidate lower technology targets by playing on superstitious
	fears, and also provides the political advantages of causing confusion over the
	wounds, and leaving no rounds which could be identified.
<P>
	Disclaimer: The above is obviously a poorly justified plot device. However I
	like it, so I included it, don't flame me for technical details, think up an
	alternative that improves the plot and post it. Also, please excuse any
	glitches in the plot or setting, it taken a long time to type this.......
