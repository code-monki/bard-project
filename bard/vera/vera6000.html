<B>NEWSFLASH</b><BR>

In an attempt to make your next journey into the Wilds a safer and less 
stressful one, we here at Myopic Industries have created a series of 
preloaded Decoy Dispensers.  These Dispensers can be loaded into any 
starship hull with minimal modifications to the vessel and with a turn 
around time of less than 24 hours in most B Class or greater starports 
(Installation times not guarantied in C Class or lower starports).  <p>

Each dispenser contains one-hundred decoys of either Flare, Arisol, or 
Chaffe, customers preference.  Now you're probably wondering how much 
space piece of mind like that is going to take out of your cargo hold.  
Four cubic meters?  No.  Three Cubic meters.  No.  Not even two cubic 
meters will disappear from your cargo hold.  <p>

Why you ask?  Why's that?  That's because each Myopic Decoy Dispenser has 
a volume of only one cubic meter, an a mass of just 1.5 tons.  Now you're 
probably thinking to yourself, "That's a pretty small package for that 
kind of piece of mind, what's it gonna set me back?"  You may think that 
piece of mind like that doesn't come cheap but exactly what price would 
you put on a human life, your life?  The life of your husband?  Your 
wife?  Your children?  Think about it and when you've thought it over 
long and hard, then tell me what price is to expensive for your safe 
return home.<P>
