One of the most difficult probles aboard a starship is keeping things
clean.  Dirt, dust, and waste products can clog filters, line ductwork,
and generally make the ship look and smell like a pigpen.  Ship's with
sub-standard life support systems, such as the standard type S Imperial
scout, are even more prone to problems of bad smells and mold growth.
<P>
As an aside, one of the biggest problems is the ship's crew and passenger
complement.  Humans sweat, cough, and most notably, slowly shed their hair
and skin.  In a starship, as in dirtside dwellings, as much as 90% of dust
and grime is human hair and exfoliated human skin, which is a lovely food
source for microbes.
<P>
The schloobie, a genetically engineered animal first produced in the
Solomani sphere but now generally avalible in Imperial space, is one
solution to this problem.  Looking rather like a furry rug, the schloobie
has no bones - it moves by a rythmic motion of its hair.  It can flow
into the smallest spaces, and eats a wide range of organic materials,
including dead human skin, mold, and other organics.  It keeps ductwork
and crew quarters clean, eliminating the need to dust most surfaces.
<P>
Schloobies mass roughly 2 kilos, and come in a wide variety of colors so
that one can match them to a ship's decor.  They live from three to five
years.  They do not reproduce - they are in effect manufactured by
biotech companies.
<P>
A typical ship will carry one schloobie for every 10 persons on board -
luxury liners often carry more to insure higher standards of cleanliness.
<P>
Shloobies can also be used as a substitute for showers or baths.  When
rubbed over the body, they remove dead skin and dirt, though care must be
taken to avoid removing hair, since a schloobie left on too long will
digest it.  As a result, schloobies are common on desert worlds and other
places where water is scarce.
<P>
Schloobies work best with Human or Vargr waste, since they are designed
to digest organics based on Terran biology.  Vargr do not care for
schloobies, however, since they often will eat a vargr's fur while he sleeps.
