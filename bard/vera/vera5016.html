  There's an interesting setup in the Korinall Cluster campaign, where a bunch
  of these suckers get Virused and build their own civilisation in the ruins
  of the human settlement of the system. They manage to achieve a totally
  independant culture and live withou harming anybody, yet the players, even
  after finding all of this out, instinctively wanted to nuke the place
anyway. <sigh><P>


The <i>Cyclops</I> was developed from the Eyeball series of recon drones. Intended for long-duration system survey work, it was
entirely autonomous and capable of performing an extensive survey of a star system all by itself, without requiring
service or refuelling. The drone carries fuel for forty four years of continuous operation, providing reaction mass may be
topped up by gas giant scooping or ocean refuelling. <P>

The <i>Cyclops</I> is designed to work alone. The normal method of operation for a scout service would be based around a carrier
ship, say a converted Jayhawk Far Trader. This ship could carry ten <i>Cyclops</I> units in cargo space, and drop one drone in
each of ten systems. By the time it had dropped off the tenth, the first has had ten weeks to complete a system survey,
and may be picked up. The mothership has performed ten ten-week surveys in twenty weeks.<P>

Alternatively, the drone may be dropped into a system and left for a period of years to perform detailed geological and
biological surveys of all bodies present. While still within the drone's abilities, this is more risky since a single
major malfunction stands to result in the loss of so much data.<P>

In order to operate alone away from maintenance for so long, the <i>Cyclops</I> is able to self repair. Each of the two main
computers contains the necessary information to maintain a drone, and in fact to manufacture spare parts if the correct
materials are available. This provides, in effect, a bank of skills including Ship's Engineering, Gravitics, Electronics,
Mechanics and so on. Memory limitations mean that only one such skill may be loaded into the brain at once, but the whole
range is available. Duplication of all vital systems mean that any one malfunction, short of the reactor or the brain
itself, can be repaired using alternate systems. It is this ability which allows the incredibly long lifetime away from
human operation.<P>
 
This robot was designed with the vehicle rules so it uses those for hit purposes and for movement rules.<P>

  The drone's data socket may be connected to its secondary computer, allowing a range of secondary skills to be placed in
  the sixth slot. This facility is often used for self repair.
