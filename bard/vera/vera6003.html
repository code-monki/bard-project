    <h3>Modular Guard Tower</h3>

  Comes in kit form, to be assembled as needed. Tower is a 3m-side triangular
  section made of 2.5 inch aluminium tubing fitted with universal clips at
  each end for rapid assembly. Tripod-mounted weapons may be mounted on the
  handrail if spigot-clamps are available.<P>
  
  Each tower requires a Top Section, which provides a platform and handrails.
  Below this may be added Tower Sections, each adding 2m of height. Each adds
  a horizontal triangle of tubes, a vertical 2m tube on each corner and a
  diagonal on each side made of two 2m tubes joined end to end. Each section
  includes a 2m section of lightweight aluminium ladder.<P>
  
  Finally, Buttresses are available for added bracing on rough ground. Two of
  the three tubes are joined to make a 4m bracing strut, while the third
  attaches close to the base of the tower and holds the buttress firmly in
  place. Up to two may be added at each corner.<P>
  
  <B>Top Section</B>: - 3m triangle, 1m high handrails;
  6 x 3m tubes, 3 x 1m tubes, 6 x 15m guy wires. Floor meshing. Mass 30 kg<p>
  
  <B>Tower Section</B>: - 2m high.
  3 x 3m tubes, 9 x 2m tubes, 2m ladder section - Mass 32 kg<p>
  
  <B>Buttress</B> for base (up to two on each corner)
  3 x 2m tubes - Mass 6kg<P>

<h3>Inflatable Camp Furniture</h3>
 
  Made of lightweight flexible plastic, these allow luxuries of home to be
  taken to campsights. May be inflated orally or by a small compressor.<P>
  
  <B>Washstand</B>: Cuboid block 1m wide and deep and 1.2m high, this contains a
  sink-shaped recess in the top surface. Bags on the base may be filled with
  water for stability.<P>
  
  <B>Chair</B>: Anice comfy armchair - perfect for relaxing after a long day's
  hunting or hiking. It does squeak a little when the sitter oves around
  though.<P>
  
  <B>Sofa</B>: Like the above, but allowing for the fact that sometimes two friends
  want to sit together.<P>
  
  <B>Bed</B>: Obvious and important item for the camper more used to home comforts.
  Ten centuries of development have produced an airbed that can seal small
  leaks by itself, and doesn't squeak when you shift in the night.<P>

<h3>Luxury Camp Furniture</h3>

  <B>The Gravbed</B>:  Utilising TL-12 contragravity technology, this barely portable
  unit generates a localised field allowing up to four people to sleep in free
  fall, eighteen inches above the ground. The unit requires a constant 10 kW
  supply while in use.  Mass 20kg, plus another 13kg for a portable fuel cell
  if no generator available, Cost 3,000 Cr (+2000 for the fuel cell.)<P>
  
  <B>The Gravchair</B>: A novel application of Grav Belt technology, this device is
  intended for safari and expeditions on scenic worlds. The chair contains a
  CG unit, drinks cabinet, and a small table suitable for reading or playing
  cards. As a safety feature, the unit is powered via a cable from the ground,
  which also serves as a tether cable. The Grav Sofa is similar but more
  expensive, and allows two friends to enjoy a drink and the scenery together.
  The manufacturers are researching ways of facilitiating airborne Bridge
  games. Mass 100kg, Cost 100,000 Cr.<P>
