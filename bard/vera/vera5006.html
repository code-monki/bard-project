  ABC Warriors (Atomic/Biological/Chemical) are an old type of Solomani 
  warbots designed to be used in situations which are too hazardous for 
  human troopres. While the first ABCs were build during the Rule of Man, 
  some of them just refuse to die of old age. These warbots come on 
  several configurations, but are generally shaped as a large human, and 
  can use the same equipment as humans.<P>
  

An ABC Warrior is about three times heavier than a human of same size.
The light tentacle which contain laser cutter and power interface is 
normally retracted within the robot's chest.<P>

The photovoltage cell will require 290 hours of 1 kW/m2 radiation 
to completely recharge the battery. In Terra this would take ~24 days. 
Because of this solar-charging, an abandoned ABC Warrior might be 
functional centuries after the war has ended. ABSs may carry folding 
photovoltage cells or generators for field recharging.<P>

Program interface allows robots to swap skill programs (40 memory units 
available). Since the tentacle allows fine manipulation, an ABC Warrior 
may also have various non-combat skill programs, including engineering, 
electronics, mechanics, intrusion, etc. With suitable skill, and ABC 
Warrior may repair itself or another robot.<P>

For 151,900 Cr additional price the brain can be replaced with advanced 
model with more synaptic processors (INT 5) and self-learning synaptic 
memory (EDU 4, can learn up to EDU 8). The advanced brain usually 
includes Emotion Simulation, and the self-learning memory allows the 
robot to develop personality.
("Lara succeeded. I finally felt a real emotion. It was 'hate'.")<P>

According to VF, the robot brain consumes 1 kW power, which is quite 
ridiculois amouont. More reasonable value for this 18-processor brain 
would be 180 W or less.<P>

All major joints are covered with ballistic cloth to keep them free of 
dirt. Some robots may wear additional replaceable protection over 
smaller joints to prevent dust wear and increase maintenance intervals. 
Because of this, a group of ABC Warriors may appear to be a mixed group 
of individually equipped robots vearing bits of human uniforms.<P>

This design was built with a mix of Book 8: <cite>Robots</cite> and <cite>Vampire Fleet</cite> rules.<BR>
