Grav Tanks are typically heavily armed, moderate
agile versions of normal tanks.  They typically have a main gun in a
turret.  They are some of the main attack units in TL12+ cavalry units.
They typically carry heavy armor.  All else being equal, these vehicles
can best any other Armored Fighting Vehicle they come up against.  These
are also typically expensive and hard to maintain, thus they are uncommon
outside of veteran cavalry units.</p>


The Brutus Heavy Grav Tank was created by the Ides of March
mercenary unit.  Its goal was to provide a low-tech grav tank that could go
toe-to-toe with Imperial vehicles like the Trepida.  The vehicle is fairly
expensive, and requires a lot of maintenance.  However, it does very well in its
primary capacity as a grav tank hunter/killer. Its armor is as thick as a
Trepida, and its main gun does more damage. It also has endurance for 28
hours of maneuver and 1 year worth of power.  Thus, it can usually go a couple
of days between refueling.  It can operate off of hydrocarbons or water, they
just increase the wear and tear on the engine.</p>
<p>
The vehicle is a turretted vehicle, with a ETC main gun and
a coaxial VRF gun in the turret, with a separate cupola containing another VRF
gun.  The coaxial VRF gun can't be used simultaneously with the main gun.  It
can attack both ground targets, or act as a point defense weapon when computer
controlled.  The crew layout is the traditional one for a turretted AFV--driver
in the body and the gunner in the turret and commander in the cupolla.</p>
