The AT-ST is an ancient design, dating back to the Rule of Man. The walker
designs were popular in the exploration of environments with broken terrain
and high winds � places where neither wheels nor aircraft were effective.
The design later became popular with some explorers due to its novelty and
romantic appeal. 
<P>
The design is a tough, no-nonsense one: the AT-ST is  an ugly box-like cabin
propped on a pair of massive legs. Most of the components are simple and
durable, with little in the way of innovation. The heavy armor was
considered overkill except by the people who ran them around on wild,
uncharted planets. The AT-ST was also a slow, ponderous mover with a
notoriously bumpy ride.  The one thing that could be said in favor of its
gait was that it was equally bumpy over any type of terrain.
Several units modified the vehicles for military use by adding machine guns
or light CPR guns to make scout walkers. Most of these were mediocre weapons
at best: slower than a scout car or helicopter and lacking the firepower of
a tank. Nevertheless, their crews showed great loyalty to the machines,
causing them to stay in service longer than their military record would
recommend.
<P>
The AT-ST�s fell out of favor with the widespread use of air-rafts and other
high-efficiency CG vehicles. 
The walker shown below is the basic model, without weapons or additional
sensors. The cargo bay was often modified to give the vehicle better
sensors, weapon packages longer range or converted into a bunk room so the
explorers could rest in safety.
