The night was quiet. The sky hologram showed dark sky with small, bright 
stars, which shed little light to the alley.<P>

He wiped the blade clean with a piece of torn shirt, folded the knife, 
and threw the bloody rag back at its previous owner. Stepping around the 
pool of blood, he briefly glanced at the girl's body, and began to trot 
towards the mouth of the alley. <P>

He pushed his hands deep into the pockets of his worn jacket, keeping 
the folded knife in right hand while the left hand fondled the freshly 
stolen wallet and wristor unit. The wristor would pay for his fix 
tonight, and the wallet would surely contain charge-cards, with enough 
money for another dose.<P>

"LIIKKUMATTA!"<P>

He turned towards the voice, and was momentarily blinded by the 
flashlight beam. His mind groped for words, and dimly he remembered that 
the command was translated as "freeze". His anti-glare contacts quickly 
adjusted to the light, he saw a lone cop aiming him with a flashlight. 
He shifted the knife in his hand, finding the thumb-sweep, and prepared 
to lunge with the knife. A cop armed only with a flashlight would not 
take him in... <p>

The Torch, manufactured by Airam in Vyborg, is a family of 
tool-weapons, designed for military/law-enforcement applications.<P>

The Airam Torch is a combination of searchlight, laser weapon and impact 
weapon. The Torch can work as normal variable-power flashlight, but a 
flick of the thumb switch turns it into a low-power rapid pulse laser. 
The basic weapon is a straight stick with sunken focal array on front 
end and control switch in front of the balance point. A rechargeable 
battery is inserted at the rear of the weapon.<P>

In the flashlight mode the battery consumption depends on the lamp  
power level, which is selected by sliding the selector switch 
backward and forward. For example, using Long Torch as a 5W lamp will 
consume one shot from the battery after 1340 seconds of continuous use 
(0:22:20 h), while 25 W lamp will consume one shot in 268 seconds 
(0:04:28 h). The remaining battery charge is shown as a LED bar at the 
rear at the weapon.<P>

Sliding the lamp switch sideways to either side activates the laser. At 
firing position, a small button pops up in the middle of the switch, 
informing the user that the laser is armed. Slight pressure on the 
switch activates the aiming beam, and the rate of fire is selected by 
pushing the selector switch forward. The laser is fired by pressing the 
switch into the weapon frame.<P>

When the switch is released (for example, the Torch is dropped), a 
spring returns the switch back to lamp position<P>

Ambulance hovered near the mouth of the alley, while paramedics collected
the remains of a man into black plastic bags. Two cops were standing near
their patrol speeder, discussing with the fire-department clean-up crew.<P>

<UL>"So, do you know who he was?"<P>

"Yes, we just got the DNA test results. Anyway, he was a nobody. A refugee
junkie who got here four months ago, and has been high since then."<P>

The fireman looked at the paramedics, who were finishing their work.<P>

"So, he attempted to resist the arrest?"<P>

"Yeah, but they try it only once."<P>
</UL>

<B>Design notes</b>: The Torch is built as a normal DEI laser. The length of
the laser is calculated by adding the volumes of all components and
battery together, and calculating the length of a cylinder which
diameter is equal to or greater than the diameter of the focal array.<P>
<HR><P>
<h3>The <I>Long Torch</I></h3>

The Long Torch, also called as "Baton Torch", is the most commonly seen 
Vyborgian police tool. The Torch is a 5x47.6 cm straight stick with 
sunken focal array on front end. A set of disc-shaped cooling fins 
surround the focal array. Because of the superdense frame and cooling 
fins, the Torch is sometimes called "Flanged Mace".<P>

At the maximum rate of fire, the Torch fires low-energy beams at 250Hz 
rate. As this rate is over ten times the human eye refresh rate (~24Hz), 
the beam will appear to be continuous as long as the laser is not waved 
around too fast.<P>

<h3>The <I>Mini Torch</I></h3>

The Mini Torch is compact and low-power version if the Long Torch, small 
enough to be carried comfortably in belt loop. Mini Torch can fire only 
one full-energy pulse in a second, but can also fire a burst of 10 low- 
energy beams.<P>

<h3>The <I>Pocket Torch</I></h3>

The Pocket Torch is a compromise between campact size and firepower. 
The palm-sized laser rod fits easily to pocket, but can still inflict 
as much damage as TL-8 9x19mm automatic pistol, and has much better 
range than the pistol.<P>

<h3>The <I>Micro Torch</I></h3>

Micro Torch is a finger-sized laser rod, small enough to be attached to 
a keychain. The damage and range performance is minimal, but the weapon 
is still quite nasty if fired at eyes or other sensitive organs.<P>
