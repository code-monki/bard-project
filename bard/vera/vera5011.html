   No one is entirely sure where the <I>Hunter</I> design came from but it is
one of a series of "fierce face" virally infected robots found through
out the rimward regions of the old Imperium.  Standing nearly two meters
tall with a purposely designed human frame constructed entirely of a
chrome Bonded SD alloy the <I>Hunter</I> is designed to instil fear in the
human populace on the worlds it is deployed on.  With bipedal locomotion
and an exceptionally small combat chassis the <I>Hunter</I> is more than
capable of rooting out resistance pockets in places most robots are
entirely unable of getting into.
<P>
   The <I>Hunter</I> possess an exceptionally sophisticate 13b robot brain
accounting for more than half of the robot production value but given
the small size of the machine in comparison to most combat robots the
larger 13a brain was simply out of the question.  With a sophisticated
sensor suite, powerful upper body for it's size and integral weapons
link the <I>Hunter</I> is a fearsome opponent on the battle field no matter
who's side it is fighting on.
<P>
   Due to the <I>Hunter</I>'s incredible Endurance, twenty-five years, most
Virally infected <I>Hunter</I>s have extremely well developed personalities
which
when combined with their unusual linguistic abilities and even more
unusual Trauma Aid have combined to develop a sentience which is
particularly
stable.<P>
                                             
     
Rumours persist regarding the existence of an elite unit of Hunters with
Looking Glass surface modification.  Rumours also persist about the existence of Hunter wrapped in a
biological skin allowing them to pass virtually undetected through human
populations.  This rumour can neither be confirmed nor denied.
<P>
It is suspected that the Hunter's can reprogram themselves virtually
instantaneously.  This would indicate that they have remote access to
some kind of larger database of knowledge which they simply tap into
when it becomes necessary.
<P>
Most Hunter's displace an incredible amount of contempt for their prey
whom they track relentlessly.  Oddly enough Hunters have been observed
tracking and destroying other robots on a number or worlds.
Hunters usually operate in teams of three to four and are particularly
familiar with old Imperial tactic's and doctrine.
