This is the RC's standard reconsat -- used to monitor nearby star systems
and collect data on worlds within the AO. The are close-range satellites,
designed to monitor a portion of a planet and the surrounding space.
Typically several of them are placed in system with overlapping fields of
view. The reconsats monitor continuously and store their reading in memory.
The information can be downloaded manually or via the radio with a special
code.
<P>
These satellites have no provision for movement or remote operations: they
are designed for long-term monitoring of the planetary surface and nearby
aerospace traffic. They have enough memory for 6 months of intermittent
observation or three weeks of continuous observation. When the satellite
runs out of space, it begins taping over its earliest observations, although
it is able to store priority observations permanently (such as starships in
orbit or nuclear detonations).
<P>
The computer is designed to operate the sensors and the radio: it has no
other function. Price, volume, mass and power consumption are all 1/10 of a
flight computer. The information must be processed through a flight computer
or better to render the data legible to people.
The reconsat has no inherent thrust or flight-correction ability.
<P>
The batteries supply about five hours of power to the sensors, computer and
EMM. That power is reduced to three hours if the radio is operating. To
counteract this power loss, captains frequently wash a ladar or similar
light source across the solar panels to provide extra power for the data
transfer. It takes 5.5 hours for the solar cells to recharge the batteries
(in addition to operating the the aforementioned systems).
<P>
The satellite�s EMM masking is not used to hide the satellite from view but
rather to disguise it�s appearance as useful equipment. Each satellite comes
with a special shell used to disuse its appearance as something else: a
broken weather satellite, starport wreckage or other piece of space-junk.
The solar panels are especially designed to appear shattered and useless,
although they operate normally. To represent this, the volume of the solar
panels has been doubled. The disguise sheath is not represented in the total
volume of the satellite and triples the satellite�s volume and weight (see
below). This disguise is only effective against sensors: visual inspection
will reveal that the equipment inside is new and operating.
