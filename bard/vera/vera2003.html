<P>
This vehicle was based on the design from DGP's <cite>101 Vehicles</cite><P>

With the advent of fusion power and crystaliron
construction, the construction of long-duration deep
submergence vehicles and vessels finally became
feasible. The <I>Tiamat</I> Mining Crawler, first marketed by
Sternmetal Horizons (now just Horizons) in the early
900s, was one of the most common PC designs intended
for ocean-floor mining. At 500 tons displacement, the
<I>Tiamat</I> is one of the largest free-standing vehicles
ever manufactured.  The vehicle is not very fast, but
it can swim forward on its treads and with the
assistance of small propellers, and its performance is
decent for mining operations. The vehicle has
staterooms for a crew of 40-80 people, an auxillary
vehicle bay for crawlers, DSRVs and hardsuits. Two
massive robotic arms, capable of lifting 1050 tons
each, do the actual mining.
<P>
On most TL-9 to 10 worlds, the <I>Tiamat</I> and its cousin
the <I>Gashedda</I> are the only means of reaching oceanic
resources. Most <I>Tiamat</I>s run year-round, recieving
relief crews every six months or so. Aside from
periodic maintenance, these vehicles almost never see
sunlight. The <I>Tiamat</I> is light enough to float,
requiring the use of ballast tanks to weigh down the
vehicle during mining operations. The vehicle's cargo
bay is seperated into two seperate holds: one for
normal stores, and the other a combination
cargo/ballast bay.  A set of water ports and pumps
fills the cargo/ballast bay to submerge the vehicle.
This water is displaced back out from the bay by ore
accumulated from mining operations. As the bay is not
large enough to still overcome the vehicles buoyancy,
jettisonable weights are carried as well, usually mine
tailings.  Because the vehicle will be operating under
extreme load conditions, the engine and transmission
are enormous even for one of this magnitude.  Even at
full weight, a <I>Tiamat</I> can reach highway speeds of 70
kph, though governors keep it from exceeding this
speed when operating at lower loading weights.
<P>
The <I>Tiamat</I> listed below is the generic model. Most
<I>Tiamat</I>s are custom built to customer desires, and
fittings include nodule dredges, sickbays and labs,
and additional launch and vehicle facilities. Other
models include vacuum and fluid atmosphere mining,
aquaculture and factory fishing, factory platforms,
starship towing and service, and wilderness
construction. The <I>Tiamat</I> is named after the sea
monster/dragon of ancient Babylonian myth.

Without the engine governor, the vehicle can
attain 220 kph road, 88 kph cross country, and 44 kph
water. Usually local laws and company regulations
strictly forbid either tampering with the
transmission, or in allowing a 500 dt vehicle from
moving at such a high velocity.
