<P>
 The <I>Moonbow</I> APC is based on the <I>Sunfire</I> Grav tank design.  In the Moonbow, the sloping of the rear and sides was removed to allow for passengers.  The main gun of the <I>Sunfire</I> was also removed.  Other than that, the two are identical.  The <I>Moonbow</I> can carry up to 20 troops in adequate seating.  The APC has two large cargo hatches which allow all 20 troops, even equipped with battledress, to exit in one combat round.  <P>

 The <I>Moonbow</I> has an automatic grenade launcher which can provide fire support to its troops.  The grenade launcher is capable of taking out lightly armored vehicles and enemy personnel.  <P>

 The vehicle is equipped with the <a href="vera7602.html"><I>Shooting Star</I> </a>defensive system.  A computer controlled rotary gun  equipped with a a state of the art point defense computer is capable of destroying incoming artillery rounds, missiles etc.  This along with 10 decoys gives the <I>Moonbow</I> increased survivability on the battlefield.
         <P>

 The vehicle has two full sized computers, which reduce the maintenance demands by a factor of four. Though expensive these computers drastically reduce the upkeep cost of the vehicles over their projected lifetime.  They also provide large amounts of computing power to aid the crew.   This aid includes enhanced image processing, threat analysis, and tactical surveys.  None of the recent Solee designs have command versions.  Modifying vehicles for command, makes it possible to identify those single out those vehicles, and if the command vehicle is taken out, then the second in command has fewer resources to command the unit with.  Instead Solee provides all of its vehicles with communication systems capable of interfacing with orbiting support craft.  The full sized computers also provide assistance the commander.
