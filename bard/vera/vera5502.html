The weapons are fully detatchable, and servicable separately.  The 
4.3cm PGMP has an additional chamber for firing lower power TL10 rounds,
thus making logistics easier.  In fact, all ammo can be replaced by
a TL10 world.  The TL10 PGMP is rather weak, but still more powerful
than most sniper rifles.  The best long range weapon is definitely the
six packs.  With a maximum effective range of 800m, these are extremely
fast, and capable of opening up even the heaviest Battledress.  They
are also capable of badly damaging the surface elements on spacecraft,
and lightly armored vehicles can be easily destroyed by them.  The PGMP
while packing more "oompfh" also carries a lot less ammo.  And since the
higher TL ammo cannot be replaced, it is used sparingly.  However, the
lower power TL10 ammo is used rather frequently, as a reload is only
Cr300.  The laser in thin atmospheres is a fairly capable anti-infantry
weapon, however the designator, and jammer must both be off to use the
laser.  The Needler is probably the weakest weapon, however due to its
nearly unlimited cheap ammo, it is the most used weapon.  Short ranged,
medium damage to unarmored targets, this gun is just vicious.  However,
the jammer, and designator must be off, and the HEPlaR operating at a
max of 310kph in order to fire the weapon.  <p>

The claws are for the more
"quiet disposal methods" that Special Forces agents prefer.  The siren
on the other hand is merely a fun trademark.  As the <i>Talons</i> swoop in,
the siren lets out a piercing screech. Cliched but oh well.  Lastly,
the suit can be refueled by any starship or vehicle carrying LHyd, and
it can carry an additional 12.728kg without incurring any weight penalty
to agility or initiative.  Also, since the weapons are modular, many 
times the <i>Black Talons</i> will drop the expensive Fusion Gun for more cargo
capacity.  In EVA the <i>Eagles</i>  are typically transported by the <i>Nighthawk</i> 
BattleTaxi (which I haven't designed yet), and are fitted with O2 tanks.
Also, the lighter HEPlaR pack is often replaced by a heavier version 
which is discarded once the ship has been boarded.<p>

<H4>Notes:</H4>
24kg left over for cargo and extra equipment.
The suit as listed only weighs 396 kg, which leaves 24 kg for 
extra equipment. Note the armor as a whole is TL-10, but the the fuel
cell, and 7mm ACR could be made
on TL 7 and TL9 (respectively) worlds.
