"Laser Blade" is a powered melee weapon consisting of a small range
finder and battery-powered 2 kW laser cutter. The weapon looks like a
contoured 2.5 x 17.1 cm metal rod with focal array at one end and a
power switch on the side near the array. When the rod is held in hand at
sabre-grip, the power switch can be pressed with thumb. Pressing the
switch activates the range finder.<P>

The laser cutter will be activated as long as the power switch is
pressed and there is a target within one meter in front of the range
finder. When the rod moves near a target, the laser cutter "blade" is
activated only when the "blade" touches the target within one meter.<P>

The laser cutter is focused at small area so that the fluency is high
enough to cause vaporization before heat conduction (like surgical
lasers). When that "blade" passes across a living target, it leaves a
series of ragged holes caused by small steam explosions.<P>

The maximum rate of fire can be selected by a ring selector situated
around the focal array. The selector has six positions marked with
numbers 0 - 5. At "0" the higher numbers mark higher pulse rates. If the
laser blade is used as weapon, the selector is usually set at position
"1" or "2". Higher settings are preferred only when the blade is used as
cutting tool.<P>

<B>Notes</B>: This is very unusual weapon, since it has some features of both
ranged and melee weapon. The strength of user has nothing to do with the
damage, and the weapon has immaterial energy "blade". The rate of fire
is also quite high, so the weapon is likely to "fire" several shots at
each successful melee hit.<P>

Instead of using the huge range finders from FF&S fire control section,
I used small rage finder, similar as one used in currently avaialable
commercial optical devices (camears, etc). The range finder is 1 cm3, 2
gram, 5 Cr, and is accuarate within ~50 m range.<P>

If "d10" is used as damage dice, the damage and number of hits at
various setting would be:<P>

<table border>

<TR><Th># <Th> Rate <Th>Damage <Th>Hits</tr>
<TR><TD>0 <TD> 0    <TD>0    <TD>  0</tr>
<TR><TD>1 <TD> 50   <TD>1d10 <TD>  2d6</tr>
<TR><TD>2 <TD> 150  <TD>1d6  <TD>  6d6</tr>

<TR><TD>5 <TD> 2500 <TD>1    <TD>  6d100</tr>
</table><P>

The number of hits was obtained by calculating how many times the weapon
fires in 1.2 seconds and selecting suitable amount to dice. Note that
only the settings "1" and "2" are used in combat. The hits should be
divided evenly to 1d6 hit locations.
<P>

<B>Example</B>: A human is hit with a laser blade. The blade was set at rate
#1, which produces 2d6 hits with 1d10 damage at 1d6 locations. Player
rolls for 8 hits at 3 locations. This means 3 hits at first and second
locations and 2 hits at the final location.
<P>
The rolled hit locations were: chest, right arm, left leg. The GM
decides that the last location is too unlikely target for a single swipe
and that the laser blade passed from chest (3 hits) to right arm (3
hits), and did not reach the leg. The final result is DV 3 to chest and
DV 3 to right arm, and only 6 shots were used from the 1000-shot
battery.
