<Font size=4>20Mw Portable Fusion Generator</font><BR>

Calling this system ³portable² belies the fact that it is an enormously
bulky and massive piece of equipment. Perhaps, independent is a better
description. The power plant measures 2m x 2m x 3.5m and will sink into the
earth if not properly supported. This model found frequent use as a
semi-permanent power supply for bases, emergency teams, colonists and the
like -- people  who need a lot of power for months or years but don¹t plan
on needing a permanent structure. These devices are common all through the
fronteir provinces due to their long life and simple, rugged design. 
The entire assembly is extremely durable, featuring a weather-tight armored
shell (AV=3) that can withstand 10 atmospheres of pressure for extended
periods of time. The power plant has an integral tank for 1000 liters of
fuel, enough for 1.5 years of use at maximum power. The unit also has
integral contra-grav lifters to make the device easier to transport and
allows the machine to be placed on soft earth without settling into it. The
contragrav units, while active, use .1 Mw while in use. <P>
There is also a small cargo space (572 liters) that is used to hold tools,
spare parts, power cables and the like. One common addition is a large,
foldable mylar balloon. This can be filled with hydrogen bled from the tanks
to provide neutral buoyancy for the generator, allowing the fusion plant to
be moved with muscle power alone -- a slow, tedious process. Owners are
warned not to overfill the balloon, as this can cause your fusion plant to
float away and not come down until the hydrogen has leaked out of the
balloon-- months later.

Advances in fusion technology make this the first of the truly portable
fusion units. Although still massing over 3 tons, it is compact enough to be
placed in the back of an explorer vehicle or used to power a supply camp or
wilderness retreat. It resembles a cube 115 cm on a side. This unit also
sports an integral CG system, allowing it to be moved more easily. 
This unit shares the rugged nature of portable units, having a water-tight
armored shell (AV=2) safe to 10 atmospheres. There have been several
examples of this unit found operating after being submerged in water or mud
for years and still operating at low power. The plant has a 300 liter tank,
enough to provide peak power for 1 year. A 147 liter cargo box is placed on
the side for tools and power cables (or cookware). <P>
Several models sport a heat sink on the top of the device, allowing the
surface of the reactor to be used as a makeshift stove. This unit was
especially popular with wilderness guides who would cook their guest¹s
dinner on top of the reactor unit.<P>
Unlike earlier fusion plants, this unit is small enough to not require
annual maintenance. Instead, it needs to be serviced no more than once every
three years.

<Font size=4>0.75 Mw Portable Fusion Generator</font><BR>

This design proved to be one of the most popular as it could actually be
thrown in the back of a truck or air raft and taken to a destination without
difficulty. It has the same CG lifters that the earlier units have. It¹s
tough, weather-sealed skin has an AV=2. Units of this size and smaller no
longer require scheduled maintenance other than to clean the filters and
occasionally adjust the flow controls. <P>
The reactor has a 19.8 liter tank that supplies the unit with fuel for over
26 years and quite a few have actually run out of fuel before they broke
down. This unit has no space for tools or supplies, although it does come
with handles and tie-down loops.

These units were a common sight in the Imperium. Such devices were used to
augment power for businesses that didn¹t want or were unable to draw their
full requirements from the local power grid. Because of the unit¹s small
size, it is not fitted with a CG lifter. <P>
These units came with an armored shell (AV=1) but they could be equipped to
run in hazardous areas by placing it in a heavier shell (AV=3) and coating
that with a protective layer that allowed it to operate in corrosive
environments. The numbers in parentheses above represent the upgraded
version of the power plant.<P>
The plant has 9 liters of fuel, enough for 17 years of service at maximum
power.

About the size of a large ice-chest (35cm x 30cm x 76cm), this is the most
compact fusion plant that the Imperium could easily develop. It was
extremely rare but such designs are becoming more common in Regency space,
especially with the need for portable power supplies to aid in rebuilding
and exploring. The cases are amazingly durable, having a coherent superdense
body with an AV=8 and the ability to withstand nearly 40 atmospheres of
pressure. It is also coated with an inert material that resists corrosive
atmospheres <P>
The power plant has 4.8 liters of fuel; enough to support it for 9.2 years.
