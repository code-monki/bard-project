The <I>Thresher</I>-II  is product of Moorsyth Integrated Designs (the post-collapse
group consolidated from various departments of the Moorsyth Design
Corporation, including Moorsyth Extravagent Guns Division), comprising a
redesign of the popular pre-collapse Thresher weapon to meet new design
goals.
<P>
It was marketted to government and private salvage teams as a handy,
relatively discreet close-quarters weapon with considerable firepower. Some
compromises are made in the name of compactness, especially the use of small
magazines. Longer magazines are available as optional extras although the
long SMG magazine protrudes a fair way from the bottom  of the pistol grip,
and the extended GL magazine hangs down too far to allow firing in the
stock-retracted configuration.
<P>
The weapon comprises a light 9x12mm selective-fire machine-pistol with a
grip magazine with a 25x37mm LV automatic grenade launcher attached above
it. The launcher hangs over the back of the pistol, with the grenade
magazine butting up to the back of the pistol's mechanism. The weapon may be
fired from a normal carbine stance, with the stock extended, right arm bent
outward and left hand cupping right hand, or may be fired with the stock
retracted. In the more compact configuration the weapon lies snug above the
right forearm and has a grip for the left hand on top. Open sights are
fitted, but most users prefer the integral laser sight for close-quarters
work. All components are hard steel, except for a Light Alloy
receiver.
<P>
It is possible to remove the grenade launcher assembly from the
machine-pistol entirely, although the grenade launcher cannot then be fired
and
the pistol is no longer weatherproofed. The pistol alone has a mass of 0.85
grams loaded, and has a recoil of 4 for a single shot and 10 for a burst. It
is recommended that the user brace with both hands. The pistol retains the
laser sight.
<P>
Please note that the <I>Thresher</I>-II does not fire the pre-collapse 9x12mm
caseless ammo and attempts to use such may have dangerous consequences. MID
can take no responsibility for any users who attempt to use caseless
ammunition.
