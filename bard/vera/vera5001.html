 I imagine cybernetic soldier/slaves are a big part of what's happening in
 Core, and I intend to use them for my campaign. Such cyber-enemies could
be  a great foil for player characters who insist on swapping out their own 
 body-parts for that extra edge. Most humans in the Wilds (a little less
so  in the RC, and less-so to a greater extent in the still-hi-tech Regency) 
 probably have an aversion to cybernetic enhancements, since it reminds
them  of the horrors visited upon civilization by Virus. Imagine how people,
who  are already uncomfortable with cybernetics, would react to cybered 
 characters once Virus-cyber-soldiers are encountered.<P>
