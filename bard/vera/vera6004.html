This is a writeup  of an item that was discussed last year. I was asked fo
some more information on it and decided to flesh it out a bit. Please feel
free to comment.
I must give at least partial credit for this design to the Imperial
Equipment Catalog for T4. After I started this writeup, I found the exact
same thing in their book. I can only assume that this was where I got the
idea. After I read it I also decided to incorporate some of their ideas.
<P>


SmartPaint is a generic label far a wide variety of products used to cover
surfaces. It was one of the ever present features of the Imperium; used for
advertising, entertainment, information display, and vehicular/home
decoration. 
The basic premise of SmartPaint is an applied surface that can be programmed
to different colors and patterns. SmartPaint operates through a series of
transparent layers, each of which can be electrically polarized to a
different hue.  SmartPaint is designed to align itself as it is painted,
forming these layers automatically. The holographic version actually uses
several hundred layers of semi-refracting crystals to generate the illusion
of depth. SmartPaint requires a small computer to control the polarization
and a power source. Programs for SmartPaint are easily available in a wide
variety of patterns and can be custom tailored as well.
<P>
SmartPaint first becomes available at TL-10. It can only form solid colors
and simple geometric patterns(stripes, dots, blotches) and is limited to a
narrow spectrum. This version of SmartPaint usually needs a basecoat of
white to display colors accurately. Later versions do not have this
disadvantage.
At TL-11 Smartpaint can form complex patterns such as text and pictures. It
is able to operate in a broad spectrum (from near IR through UV). 
At TL-12 Smartpaint can display moving pictures; allowing animated sequences
to be played. A special mixture is flexible and safe enough to be worn on
the body, although it rubs off after a day or two of activity.
At TL-13 SmartPaint can form holographic images on itï¿½s surface. Note that
the paint cannot project images: it generates a sense of depth upon the
surface.
At TL-14 the images can be animated, allowing Tri-V animation to be played
on the SmartPaint surface.

All cans of SmartPaint weigh 2 kg and can cover 10 sq meters of surface.
SmartPaint dries to .5 kg per 10sq meters. It is applied with an integral
sprayer or roll-on device. The control devices are all about the size of an
engineering calculator and weigh .5 kg. This does not include the power
source. A control device can control up to 100 square meters of SmartPaint
and they can be hooked together for larger surfaces.
The SmartPaint can be internally illuminated for display at night by
doubling the cost and power consumption for the paint (not the control
unit). <P>

Damage to a SmartPaint surface affects only the damaged area: the rest of
the painted surface operates normally. Damage to the computer or loss of
power causes the paint to immediately revert to its transparent nature. It
is not possible to repair damaged SmartPaint, but a damaged layer can simply
be painted over and connected to the control unit.
