Originally presented in <cite>High Passage #4</cite><P>

The DDD&S Type 37 unmanned station was used by the Old Expanses sector government to protect worlds which it deemed necessary to interdict. The navy and scout service both used manned ships or satellites of their own design. Only a few examples of the Type 37 were produced, and several have been removed from service.
In addition to performing most interdiction satellite functions under the supervision of its on-board robot brains, the type 37 can also be used as a manned observation station. Facilities on board can support three officiers and nine ratings.
To provide refueling facilities a 10tn launch is stored onboard (with its own robot brain controllers). In the event that the satellite is used as a manned station, the launch is replaced with a 50th modular cutter.
The Type 37's armament consists of nuclear missiles. Since most commercial ships do  not carry nuclear dampers or significant armour, the missiles are usually effective. The satellite's high armour rating gives it sufficient protection againts the light armament of most commercial ships, even at point blank range.
<P>


The Type 37 responds to unauthorised intruders as follows:<BR>
<LI>1. A warning is broadcast on mast radio frequenceis stating the system is inderdicted and off limits. Craft are ordered to refuel at available gas giants and leave the system at once. A recording of transponder codes is made for latter investigation.
<LI>2. If the first warning is ignored, a second warning is broadcast stating the satellite is armed and will fire upon approaching vessels.
<LI>3. If this is also ignored, the satellite will fire warning shots at the incoming ship and repeat the 2nd warning.
<LI>4. If previous warning broadcasts and warning shots are ignored, the satellite will open fire to destroy the encroaching ship.
<P>
Authorised vessesls can issue override codes to prevent the armed response from the satellite. Such vessels will have their transponder codes recorded, but otherwise will be ignored. A reset code also exists that will delete the transponder record, as well as to cause the satellite to generate a damage and resupply report.
<P>
The Type 37 is depolyed within the Old Expanses sector, at the following locations
<li>134-635 - Ahri:   3 + 2 satellites (reinforced 1108 after a voliation of the inderdiction)
<li>Arcolund - Rusco: 0 (5 satellites redepolyed at 134-635 & the edge with 1 satellite decommissioned, following replacement of interdiction satellites with a manned interdiction squadron in reponse to repeated attempts to violate the interdiction)
<li>Cold Rock - Ventup: 3 satellites
<li><A href="../opal/opal3048.html">the Edge</A>- Ile: 2 satellites
