Before the invention of contra-grav, the
sole means of lifting a ground vehicle into the air
was to create an air bubble, within a contained
chamber, beneath it.  Air cusion vehicles, also known
as hovercraft, never attained much popularity, as
their power plants were bulky and temperamental.
Fusion power removed those penalties, but its
invention was accompanied by contra-grav, and the ACV
was still left an orphan technology. Many TL 9 and 10
worlds, however, never acquired, or attained the need
for, the expensive new technology. And where these
worlds were covered with extensive oceans, rolling
deserts or ice sheets, the ACV has made a renaissance.

<P>
The <I>Tavee-Gho</I> is one of several Low Stellar designs
that were found throughout Charted Space. Still
marketed in the Post-Collapse period by General
Products, it is ubiquitous to many client states and
neighbors of the Regency as well. The TG is perhaps
one of the fastest civilain ACVs available, with a top
speed on nearly 300 kph, faster than most equivalent
small civilian aircraft and helicopters. It relies
upon fusion driven ducted fans for its propulsion;
with little fuel requirements it can travel almost
indefinitely regardless of its speed. There is no
seperate provision for outside fuel injection, so the
TG's fans are not capable of afterburning.
<P>
The basic passenger model is described below, but
cargo and recreational models are generally available
as well. Armed military and paramilitary versions are
available to government and bonded mercenary buyers.
The former model is especially formidable, adding
additional armor plus a heavy autocannon and SSM
mounts.
