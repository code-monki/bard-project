AMDADS (Autonomous Mine Delivery And Dispersal System)
The AMDADS is a booster package that allows any ship capable of firing
standard space-combat missiles to lay a minefield. Each booster holds three
MkIII mines or a suitable replica. The AMDADS is loaded and fired in all
respects as a normal missile. It is controlled and powered by the mines
carried inside. Before the minefield is laid, the mines must be programmed
with their course and final positions. This can be done while they are
inside the AMDADS (where they are normally stored). A MFD can automatically
program and fire the boosters with minimal human oversight.
Once the booster has delivered the mines, it can be retrieved for re-use or
self-destruct into chaff, scattering debris for the mines to hide in.

<P>
Due to the mass of the mines, the thrusters only provide 2-G actual thrust.
The AMDADS has 140 kg of high explosive set throughout the device that is
used to break it into pieces. The explosives are set to break up the booster
with as little scattering of the pieces as possible.
