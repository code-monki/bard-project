I was disappointed with the stats in FFS for the recoil compensation
harness. It is listed as a TL-14 device and gives a ridiculously low weight
for it�s function. I wanted the same harness to be available much earlier
and become more efficient as the TL progressed. I used the basic weight of a
suit of AV=1 armored chest and arm for the frame and added a
recoil-dampening package to determine weight.<P>

<B>Weight:</B> The weight of the harness in kg.<BR>
<B>RcM:</B> The modifier to the mounted weapon�s recoil.<BR>
<B>Min RC:</B> The harness will totally absorb the recoil of any weapon with a 
            recoil number equal to or less than the Minimum recoil. <P>

The recoil compensation harness is a support that holds a mechanical arm
mounted at the wearer�s hip. The arm mounts a heavy weapon and the harness
is designed to absorb the recoil from heavy weapons giving a heavy weapon
both stability and mobility. The harness provides no protection to the
wearer but has an AV=1 for purposes of damage to the device. Any damage
penetrating the armor renders the harness useless. The weapon may still be
detached and used normally.
<P>
The harness cannot be used in conjunction with a bipod or tripod and negates
any advantages gained with a SA stock, or gyroscopic compensation.
<P>
The harness has a universal mount allowing any weapon over 50 cm to be
mounted. The weapon must have a harness socket to be mounted effectively.
Suck a socket can be built into a weapon for a cost of 100 cr. An existing
weapon can be modified to fit the harness at a cost of 500 cr and a .5 kg
bracket.
<P>
A weapon mounted into the harness cannot be aimed normally and fires all its
shots as quick shots. This can be countered with the use of an electronic
sight linked to a helmet sensor suite.
