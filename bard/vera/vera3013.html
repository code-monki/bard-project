The <I>Raptor</I> is the primary heavy combat vehicle in the service of the
<a href="../bardperi.html#Korinall">Cyrinic Ground Forces</A>.
Built at TL-13, the <I>Raptor</I> utilises Contra-Grav
Lifters and electrically tip-spun ducted fans to allow near-silent
operation and extemely long operating durations. While in normal use the
fuel tanks will be retopped at least fortnightly as part of maintenance
inspections, the  fusion plant will allow the tank to operate for a year
without refuelling.
<P>
The vehicle's configuration is fairly standard for heavy combat vehicles
- a flat boxy body underneath a large square three-man turret mounting a
single long-barreled mass driver. Atop the turret sits a
rapid-traversing cupola with a smaller mass driver and vision devices
mounted in it. The slightly drooped side decks are perforated with the
air ducts for the lift and thrust fans - six ducts to each side.
<P>
The priorities for the design were: 
<LI> High lethality against enemy armour and battledress
<LI> Good survivability in a battlefield situation
<LI> Very long operational endurance
<LI> Point-defence antiaircraft capabilities
<P>
The choice of high-velocity mass-drivers as armament allows a great deal
of ammunition to be carried, since the rounds are very small. Each
weapon has an autoloader connected to a large ammunition bin. Since the
solid rounds are totally inert there is no risk of magazine explosion.
The weapons are powered directly from the vehicle's fusion power plant,
via HPGs mounted down in the hull to conserve space in the turret. The
main coaxial machinegun carries 10,000 rounds in a single-feed
ammunition bin, but the small size of the cupola requires that the
rounds for the cupola machinegun be split into 1,000 round cartriges
which must be exchanged by hand once expended. Nine spare cartridges are
carried in the turret.
<P>
Inside the turret, the commander sits high, at the back right.The
commander normally controls the cupola, with its weapons and vision
devices. Below and in front of him sits the gunner, who traverses the
turret and fires the main and coaxial weapons. Across the breech and
slightly back from the gunner sits the sensor operator with readouts
from the main active and passive arrays, as well as the navigation
plotbox, comms gear and access to the cupola behind him to reload the
machinegun. The driver has his own compartment to front and left.
<P>
The driver has his own hatch, as does the sensor operator. The gunner
exits through the commander's hatch.
<P>
While the <I>Raptor</I> is a grav-assisted vehicle, it operates best within
four metres of the ground, where its ducted fans are enhanced by the
ground effect. Operationally, <I>Raptor</I>s only rise to altitude for
operational movement, sticking firmly to NOE for combat and using cover.
<P>
Within an Armoured Regiment, <I>Raptor</I>s are organised into Troops of four,
four Troops and two command tanks making up each Armoured Squadron.
<P>
The greatest vulnerabilities of this design are to neutrino-seeking
ordnance, fuel tank hits and if unsupported, to infantry teams with
antiarmour rockets.
