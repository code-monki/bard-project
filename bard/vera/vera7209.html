"Whispering Death"  That's what we called it.  Any time you can "reach out
and touch someone" at over a klick means God's on your side.  Karl and I
went through 74 missions together before we were accepted for Advanced
Sniper School.  Six months of additional sniper training in the worst
possible conditions.  We had well over 100 kills already and had to waste
our time learning how to shoot?  Three implants later, including a synthetic
aperature eye implant, a neural jack and a mini-ballistic computer,  we were
ready for action.  One week into deployment we thought it was time well
spent.<P>

We were on a deep infiltration assignment on Navarre.  Our target was
Maximillian Trakes, the head of the human forces "aligned" with Virus. Four
previous missions had failed.  Of course, they weren't packing a GS-1 and
they didn't have a sniper as skilled as Karl Horvath.  After 5 days of
waiting we got our first break.  Maximillian was above ground checking on
the status of a newly "infected" grav tank.  This was our chance!!  Only
trouble was that he was wearing full Battledress and was 2 klicks away.  <P>

Hell!!  It was now or never.  Karl fired off a three round burst.....<P>

Maximillian never had a chance.  Half a second later two rounds tore Max in
half!!!   Talk about first impressions!!  The GS-1 is the only weapon that
could handle such a task.  I would take one GS-1 equipped sniper team over
an entire platoon of Shock infantry!!! <P>
