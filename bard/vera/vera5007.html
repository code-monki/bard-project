     Subedei was one of the most famous generals of the Mongolian army
	 from Terra's Middle Ages.  Known for his ferocity, and his rapid
	 assaults, his name remains in our records to this day.  The Subedei
	 class defense robot is well suited to the needs of the Council.
	 <P>
	 Though its manufacture level is TL-14, all of its consumables are
	 produced at the local tech level of TL-9.  Also, this robot is very
	 cheap, costing only Cr 366,230 when fully loaded.  It carries a
	 mix of weapons meant mostly to deal powered armor troops, light
	 vehicles, and other lightly armored targets.  However, its weaponry
	 is quite versatile.
	 	 <P>
	 Starting off the mix are two Arrow-20 missle pods.  Each holds
	 a rack of twenty 2cm HEAP missles, and there are 4 reloads for
	 each tube.  The total number of missles is 200.  These missles
	 are light, massing only 90 grams, and only cost Cr1.22 each.
	 These features allow for them to be produced cheaply by the
	 hundreds of thousands.  And their lack of complex guidance
	 systems, or high tech materials means that they can be produced
	 by the locals.  They have a short range of 200m, with a maximum
	 effective range of 800m.  These can be fired one at a time,
	 as a salvo, or in rapid succesion.  They pack enough punch to
	 defeat most powered armor, and can even damage light vehicles,
	 aircraft, and civilian spacecraft.  When fired in salvo mode,
	 these are also very good for damaging buildings and firing 
	 postions.
	 	 <P>
	 The other set of weapons rounding out this robot's arsenal are
	 two 11.25mm Thompson Automatic Shotguns.  The domesticated 
	 badlife have taken to calling them "45's", but the allusion is
	 lost on us.  Anyhow, these are very effective anti-personel
	 weapons.  Both have 200 round magazines, and are capable of
	 sustained firing for over a minute at their maximum fire rate.
	 Depending on the mission, these smoothbore rifles can fire
	 either slug munitions, shotgun munitions, discarding sabot
	 munitions, or high explosive munitions.  The discarding sabot
	 rounds are mostly used for long range firing.  The HE rounds
	 pack a good punch, as does the buckshot.  Slug munitions are
	 almost never used.  These weapons come standard with flash
	 suppressor, and a full silencer.  
	 	 <P>
	 The robot also comes with an ElectroMagnetic Masking suite,
	 and WSV goggles.  The WSV goggles allow for night operations,
	 while the EMM allows the vehicle to stealthily attack the
	 badlife.  This works especially well with the silenced guns,
	 but having 40 rockets flying at you wouldn't be that great
	 either....Not to mention its top speed of 50kph, which is
	 very fast for a legged vehicle.
	 	 <P>
	 The one major drawback of this design is its power source.
	 The main design calls for a fuel cell, however the fuel
	 cell and fuel can be replaced with a battery, of equal 
	 performance, however this would slow the vehicle down. The
	 solution to this is quite simple.  The robot will mostly
	 be travelling at only 10kph.  That will allow for almost
	 10 hours of use.  Communication with breeds and other goodlife
	 is done via radio.
<P>
The robots appear as 2 meters tall, stocky build humanoids<P>
