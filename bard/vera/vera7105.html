This is a conversion of the German G11 assault rifle. My source for both was _Jane's Infantry Weapons_ (1994-95 for the G11, and
1998-99 for the AN-94). Funnily enough the calculated energy for the
5.45x39 is exactly the same as the ME listed in _Jane's_. As I chose a
barrel length that would give the correct overall length I find this
amusing, considering the difficulty one usually has getting real world
weapons looking anything like how they should. The only thing I'm not
particularly happy with is the low DV both rifles ended up with.<P>


The most advanced infantry rifle made to date, the G11 fires a caseless
round using a unique revolving action. I've rated the G11 as a TL9 design,
as it uses caseless ammunition which indicates late TL8 or early TL9, and
FF&S gives quite a big efficiency jump in muzzle energy that is IMO
consistent with the use of caseless ammo. Like the AN-94 the G11 has a very
high rate of fire in three round burst mode and thus when firing three
round bursts the first burst is not effected by recoil modifiers, although
its recoil is still counted when determining the recoil penalty for any
other bursts fired during the round.<P>
