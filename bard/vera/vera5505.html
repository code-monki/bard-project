<FONT SIZE=6>Oriflamme Light Assault Armor</FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=2>design by <A HREF="../../credits.html#Platte"> Kyle Platte </A></FONT><P>

</CENTER>  
<HR> 
Because of my love for the movie and its flavor, I have decided to model the
RC marines after the Colonial Marines in "Aliens". In this spirit, I have
designed a set of armor to be worn over the RC bodysuit similar to the
Colonial Marine body armor. I am indebted to the <cite>Aliens Colonial Marines
Technical Manual</cite> by Leo Brimmcombe-Wood for technical assistance. A really
well done book. 
I will attempt to convert other items from this source to Traveler equipment
as I get the time and initiative.
Please note that some of these figures are fudged: I could find no useful
stats for a small IR flashlight or the camera. The 3km communicator in FFS
was also unacceptable as it used 500 watts of power to operate!
Please feel free to comment on the design or the math: Iï¿½m happy with the
former but a little wobbly with the latter.<P>


The entire suit is capable of being constructed at TL-9. Since the adoption
of the RC bodysleeve, it has become the standard light armor for Oriflamme
marines and elite army troops. It is also becoming popular as a cheaper
alternative to powered armor for RCES and RCN forces.
When fully sealed and provided with an air supply, the armor is impervious
to biological and most chemical attacks. It is waterproof and airtight.
The armor is made in five different sizes and is tailored to an individual
through adjustable straps, overlapping plates and a bit of duct tape. As the
plates are not flexible, a hammer is not recommended. Very small people and
the obese cannot wear this armor. Only human versions are made at this time.
<P>
<B>Carapace:</B>
The armor consists of articulated plates in separate sections for torso,
arms and legs. The carapace has no internal harness and requires an RC
bodysleeve to be worn underneath. Pieces may be worn as needed: the chest
piece, arms and legs all detach and can be worn individually.  The plates
are made of TL-8 composite laminates: predominately titanium and boron with a
fabric lining to catch spalling.
The carapace will automatically transfer waste heat from the bodysleeve,
radiating from the backs of the legs and shoulders, the buttocks,  and
through the tail of the helmet.
The arms of the suit come with armored gauntlets that will seal the hands
against the elements (and even vacuum) but are too clumsy to allow delicate
hand movements. The gloves can be removed to perform any complex tasks.
There are attachments on the armor for a backpack/web gear as well as the
ML-2 lantern (see below). 
<P>
<B>Helmet:</B>
In addition, the armor has a full-face helmet made of 0.5cm composite
laminate with an articulated lobster-tail protecting the back of the neck.
It has an integral respirator/filter mask and attachments for connecting to
an air supply. A flexible collar can attach to the bodysuit to make the
helmet airtight.
The soldier can communicate with an integral 3-km encrypted communicator.
The radios are intended for short range tactical communications but can be
relayed through more powerful transceivers or directly connected to them.
The radio has a small attached camera capable of seeing into the visible and
IR spectrum. The image from this camera is relayed directly to a command
center through the radio network: the wearer has no access to the picture
being played. The radio and camera can be removed from the helmet liner and
worn as a headset if needed. The unit runs off batteries that are clipped to
the web gear of the soldier.
In addition, the helmet holds flip-down IR goggles (100m short rng). A small
IR penlight in the helmet can be used to read maps and documents.
All of the electronics are rugged and simple; capable of withstanding dirt,
water and pressures up to 4 atmospheres.
<P>
<B>ML-2 lantern:</B>
The lantern is a rugged lantern that operates in either the visible or IR
spectrum. The batteries have a 3 day lifespan in either mode and the light
can be turned off when not needed. 
The lamp can be worn on the armored carapace, shining over the soldiers left
shoulder or removed as an independent unit. The lamp has a small folding
tripod built in so it may be used as a remote light.
