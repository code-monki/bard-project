The Proton motorcycle is powered by a 1.0MW fusion+ power plant. 
This immense power plant gives the Proton a top speed surpassed 
only by gravitic vehicles.  The Proton carries no cargo and is 
intended purely for pleasure driving.<P>

The Proton is a very smooth and aerodynamically shaped vehicle.  
Unlike most motorcycles the Proton is totally enclosed, with the
rider on the inside of the vehicle. A transparent canopy encloses 
the rider. Without this, wind drag would make the Proton 
impossible to control.  (The vehicle in large part resembles the 
motorcycles in the Solomani 2D movie TRON.) The Proton is 
equipped with a multi-channel radio capable of communicating with 
up to 11 other vehicles. This allows several Protons riders to 
talk while whizzing down the road. The Proton features a 10km 
sensor suite capable of full night vision. This system is 
essential to the Proton, at speeds of 700kph, you have to know 
what's coming otherwise, you'll find out by crashing into it. In 
case of a catastrophic accident, an optional ejection seat is 
available.<P>

All Protons are available with Verotech's patented Smart Paint 
system. This allows the owner to specify any sort of decorative 
pattern or actual picture.  Many owners have several designs 
programed and actually switch between designs while driving, as 
a means of communicating with other vehicles.<P>

The Proton was designed with the Vehicle Design System as 
presented in the Central Supply Catalog. It is usable in any 
Traveller era set after the birth of the Third Imperium. Previous 
to this time, fusion+ had not been invented. <P>
