An experimental weapon developed by Tarantino Limited several years ago,
only twelve of these guns were ever manufactured.  These were stored in
a warehouse for a short time until they mysteriously disappeared.  None
of the guns has ever been recovered.  A unique feature of this weapon is
the special discarding sabot ammunition developed for it.  DS rounds are
generally not produced for gauss weapons because they are rather
difficult to manufacture.  The weapon was also designed to be used with
an optional cybernetic eye implant which dramatically increases the
short range of the weapon.<p>

* : Recoil is reduced by one if used with bipod<br>
** : Short range without electronic sight<br>


<B>Notes</B>:
 Maximum range with laser sight is 240 meters<br>
Short range with bipod and cybernetic eye implant is 600 (520) meters.<p>

<B>Designer's Notes</B>: This is kinda what I pictured the rail guns in the
movie "Eraser" being like.  More than likely, the firer would set up
this weapon in a discrete location and then ambush the target from long
range.
