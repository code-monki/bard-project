        After studying the current photovoltage cell technology I
        considered the FF&S solar array values to be unrealistic.
        Currently I use completely different values in my own designs.
<P>
        Since photovoltage cells transform a fraction of the incoming
        energy into electricity, I prefer to vary the energy output
        according to current conditions.
<P>

<B>        Notes:</B>

        Cells are not very durable and must be attached to a suitable
        surface.<P>

        Cells are often armored with transparent cover to keep dust,
        sand, etc, from damaging the cells.<P>

        Since the photovoltage cells are quite expensive per unit
        surface, a solar cell array may consist of large solar
        collectors (lenses or mirrors) which concentrate the light to
        the cells. Some modern satellites have large lenses directly
        over the photovoltage cells so that the hardened lens is both
        armor and collector.<P>

        <B>Example</B>: TL-14+ photovoltage cell, 0.1 m2 area (20 x 50 cm)<P>

</table><P>
        In Terra the available solar radiation is ~1386 W/m2. However,
        due to atmospheric conditions a solar array can usually receive
        only ~1 kW/m2. The average output of the above photovoltage cell
        would be 50 W.<P>

<h3>Solar-charged laser gun</h3>

This weapon is extremely simple and rugged longarm, apparently designed
for ease of use and long storage life. However, the interesting feature
is that the organically-contoured bullpup stock is covered with
photovoltage cells.<P>

The weapon contains only three moving parts: trigger, safety and battery
cover. The squeeze safety is placed on the backstrap on the pistol grip
and is automatically disengaged by the firing hand. Instead of a trigger
guard, the weapon has large knuckle-bow which allows shooting while
wearing mittens.
<P>
Inside the battery cover is a power connector which can be used to
re-charge the battery with external power or fire the gun directly using
any suitable power source.

<B>Notes:</B> The weapon is covered with scratch-proof [1] photovoltage cells,
which are used re-charge the magazine battery. When left on sun [2], the
cells produce 50 W power[3]. One shot is re-loaded in 7 min 25 sec [4].<P>
<ul>
[1] Cells are covered with additional .5 mm transparent surface, and
weapon is bought with "melee weapon" -class frame.<P>

[2] A 0.1 m2 solar array is fixed on both sides of the weapon. When the
weapon is placed on ground, either of the arrays is facing up. The cells
produce 50 W for each kW of solar radiation.<P>

[3] I estimated how large array fits by placing 10 x 10 cm paper squares
on Valmet M-82 bullpup assault rifle.<P>

[4] The loading time is for 1 kW radation. I assume that the battery has
~90% efficiency. When the array puts 50 joules in the battery every
second, 10% of this energy is turned into heat and only 45 joules are
later available from the battery.<P>
