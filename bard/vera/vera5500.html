<HR> 
The Scout walkabout armored suit is designed to provide a mobile 
environment for IISS personal exploring new and possibly 
dangerous worlds.  The same strength enhancing powered 
exoskeleton used in Imperial BattleDress allows the user to carry 
a great deal of equipment.<P>

The armor features looking glass capabilites to allow the user to
observe native life forms without disturbing them.  The armor has 
many power outlets to feed power to different carried devices. It 
also has hooks so the Scout can attach and carry the devices.<P>

The suit was based on a design in Megatraveller Journal #1 and 
was designed with Fire Fusion & Steel.<P>
