<FONT SIZE=6>MkIII Space Mine </FONT><P>

  	The MkIII is the standard Imperial space mine. Typically, three mines are
	loaded into a booster (see <A href=vera6502.html">AMDADS</A>) and fired as a normal
	space-missile. However, they can also be pushed out an airlock and
	activated.
	<P>
	The mine is a small cylinder holding a 500kt nuclear pumped x-ray laser
	surrounded by a compact PEMS system. A 0.5G HEPlaR thruster system is added
	to allow for station-keeping and the possibility of later adjustments to the
	minefield.	<P>
	The mines are very durable, capable of lying in wait for years or even
	decades. There are many documented cases of mines surviving over 75 years,
	although the majority suffer some kind of system failure after 15-20 years.
	Standard Imperial strategy is to service a minefield every 10 years to
	insure effectiveness.	<P>
	The mine is controlled by a model 13a high-autonomous robotic brain. In
	addition to its sensor and attack programming, each mine has an intuitive
	stealth system. After scanning the local area, the mine will attempt to
	cloak itself among nearby debris, satellites or asteroids. This, in
	combination with the mine's EMMS package, makes it exceedingly hard to
	detect.	<P>
	The mines will fire on any ship in range that does not transmit the proper
	code. Codes are time-based so the same code will not work twice (preventing
	it from being copied and reused). The mines can be set to ignore or
	prioritize targets based on sensor data. A minefield may also be deactivated
	by radio/maser code and picked up for maintenance or later use.
	<P>
The mine's systems operate off the battery, which is recharged from the
fusion reactor. While not recharging, the reactor lies dormant or at minimal
operating power to lower its EM signature. The HEPlaR thruster operates
directly from the reactor. The thruster and rector fuel are in the same
tank. Excessive thruster use will shorten the active life of the mine. There
is enough fuel to provide 5 hours of continuous thrust in addition to
powering the reactor for 24 years. Because of the start/stop nature of the
reactor, fuel consumption (while active) has been doubled.
Mines respond to a deactivation signal by opening access ports that negate
their stealth ability. This allows them to be more easily spotted and
retrieved, as well as informing the transmitting ship that the minefield is
safe to enter. The mines cannot be reprogrammed by remote: they must be
manually reconfigured. The exception to this is that they can be maneuvered
remotely to different locations.
	<P>
The mine's frame and systems are stressed to 2-G's to allow for the booster
to put it into position. The thruster provides .5 G of thrust but the weight
of the mine only allows for only .22 G.
