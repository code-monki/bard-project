<FONT SIZE=6> Solomani Light Missiles </FONT><P>

For short range work such as Point Defense, anti fighter duty and orbital
defense the Solomani the 4m<sup>3</sup> missile as a standard size. These missiles
mounted the smallest det laser warheads available in order to maximise
acceleration.<P>

The small size was chosen to minimise cost and to maximse the number that
could be fitted into a 3-ton turret (a holdover from the days when the
Confederation was part of the 3I). While perhaps not optimal in a manned,
civilian turret 5 fit nicely into a remote controlled turret, such as many
military ships carry.<P>

Here is the 4m<sup>3</sup> missile, from a variety of TLs. The Confederation seldom
used anything but the TL14 version, though late in the Final War the Tl13
models became more common away from high piority areas. However member
worlds often used lower TL missiles in their own ships, because they could
be made locally.<P>

All models use the Laser Receiver that one that a det laser has for 'free'
for communications, and have a Bl sig of +2/+2/+2/+2+/1.<P>

<P>
In both cases the mass is for an empty turret.<P>

Both turrets use autoloaders, because they work out cheaper than seperate
launchers for each missile. As the reload cycle is about 3 minutes this has
no  noticeable effect on the turrets ability to put missiles in the sky
over the course of a combat turn. The military model has no crew, MFD or
comms and must be operated totally remotely. The Civilian turret, like
Imperial types, has a Laser Transceiver and a Workstation as part of the
system.<P>
