   A  lower tech parallel to the Needler pistol, the Gauss Carbine was
intended for use by weapons and vehicle crews and by other troops who might
find themselves in the front line but who did not need a fully featured
combat rifle. Inferior in performance to the Imperial 4mm Gauss Weapon or
it's RC descendant, the Gauss Carbine at first appears a poor relation.
However such comparisons are invalid, the weapon should instead be compared
with the sub-machine guns, shotguns and large calibre pistols that such
troopers might otherwise find themselves armed with. Against such weapons
the gauss carbine offers equivalent damage, equivalent or superior
penetration and a greatly extended range. Its ten round burst compares
favourably with the spread from a combat shotgun and its magazine capacity
is legendary, a full two hundred rounds allowing for a truly awesome
suppressive fire capability. It should be noted that the weapon was in fact
a fully featured military rifle, the 'carbine' nomeclature being adopted
solely to distinguish it from the first line Gauss Assault Weapon.<P>

    <B>Author's Note:</B> One thing that's pretty much overlooked in RC background is that
the Solomani occupation must have left significant chunks of Solomani
ordnance lying around. I designed a few Solomani small arms a while ago and
might as well throw them out to the list for savaging <g>. One thing I was
looking at was the actual mission requirements of the Solomani in an
invasion of the Imperial worlds in the Solomani Rim, and that means lots of
fighting in high population worlds where vehicles are going to be less
useful and internal security a major problem. Watching the civs is a good
job for the lower tech Solomani outfits, especially if you seed them with
some high tech goodies -- such as Needle pistols and Carbines:<P>
