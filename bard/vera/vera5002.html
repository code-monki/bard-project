 There should be a picture at the top of the advertisement, but since this is ASCII; the
 <I>Hummingbird</I> is a flattened sphere, with a series of ducted fans around the base, sensor
 ports around the waist and a cluster of ports at the front holding weapons, sensors and
 designation equipment. A recess in the top surface, slightly offset to left of centreline,
 contains a folded manipulator arm with a sensor cluster in the wrist. Another, smaller
 manipulator lies in a second recess to its right.<P> 
 
 Vesper Technologies present the <I>Hummingbird</I>; the smart choice in automated defensive
 systems. The Hummer is a small hunter-killer bot with a great deal of versatility in
 combat, and an emphasis on smart fighting. If you're willing to pay for the best, you
 don't want it to wade in with guns blazing and get itself killed. The Hummer fights from
 cover - locating, stalking and then swooping in for a rapid one-shot kill with minimal
 risk to self. (It can also serve as an eye-in-the-sky sensor platform, searching out
 targets with its EMS array, and lasing them for remote missile or LGB attacks.)<P>
 
 
 Accordingly we've built the Hummer around the acclaimed Hebron Thought Systems 13b Brain,
 with the Release Three overdrive processor, giving outstanding processing ability in
 operation. 16% of the dynamic memory comes on easy-to-upgrade socket modules, allowing
 rapid optimisation of skillset with changing mission parameters - essential in todays
 fluid battlefield. <P>
 
 The range of sensors feeding this brain is phenomenal, allowing the Hummer to know exactly
 what's going on before it engages a target. Full surround vision is provided by a
 quintuplet of visual-spectrum eyes located around the bot's waist, with a sensor cluster
 on the front containing a Cyberline InTek Wide Spectrum Visual Eye, actually a
 military-grade bionic implant  custom altered to fit the Hummer. The cluster also holds an
 audio sensor system, radiation and magnetic sensors, and an infra-red motion tracking
 system. Backing up this whole suite is a space-quality Passive EMS Array, with a 0.5m
 antenna giving pinhead resolution out to 30km. <P>
 
 For covert observation, the Sensory/Manipulator Arm may be unfolded from the bot's roof,
 allowing observation over cover with a comprehensive multi-sensing suite, containing IR
 and ultrasonic motion trackers, an imaging-enhancing eye and an amplifying audio circuit.
 The Manipulatory Assistant Arm also contains a tactile sensor, laser cutter and chemical
 projector. In concert with plug-in memory modules or RCV control these allow the robot to
 pick locks, pick up and fire small arms, access and retrieve valuable items such as
 computer chips, perform repair work, and a whole host of other specialised tasks.<P>
 
 When the time comes to fight, the <I>Hummer</I> is no weakling. Armed for a graduated series of
 targets, a number of options are available. Against soft targets, like unarmoured
 personnel or light vehicles, the robot has a centrally mounted rapid-fire laser rifle.
 Powered directly from the robot's reactor, this fires one hundred and eight pulses per
 minute with an effective range of a kilometre.<P>
 
 For tougher targets; battledress, or light armoured vehicles, a 20-shot fusion gun is
 carried. Slightly shorter ranged than the laser, this will punch a hole through 12mm of
 Bonded Superdense armour at two hundred metres. The ammunition bin is easily accessible
 for third-party- or self-reloading, and the bot can carry five more full ammo loads in one
 of its two cargo bays.<P>
 
 For the most heavily armoured targets, tanks, spacecraft or heavy armoured vehicles, the
 Hummer engages in the safest possible way. Using an integral laser designator, the bot
 paints the target for engagement by a missile-armed third party. We recommend the Vesper
 Technologies <A HREF="../vera5002.html"><I>Firedrake</I></A>, carrying Tacoma Flying Fish antiarmour missiles, for best results.
 <P>
 Which brings me on to the final, and most novel feature of the <I>Hummingbird</I> design. The
 command system features a Slave Control Receiver, allowing external command of the unit.
 This allows the bot to serve as remote eyes, hands and guns for a human operator, or
 another bot. In tests a <I>Hummingbird</I> has even performed first aid and CPR on a dummy human,
 controlled by a field medic from eight kilometres away.<P>
