Last weekend I was toying around with a FF&S1 weapon design
        spreadsheet, and I wrote a design sequence for direct energy
        input versions of plasma and fusion weapons. I used the design
        rules from FF&S1 and "Striker II", and combined them with the
        DEI rules form FF&S2. Instead of using EPG plasma cartridges,
        the design DEI rules state the amount of energy and hydrogen
        used for each shot.
 <P>
        When I examined the resulting weapons I was surprised to see the
        excessive recoil values. To see if the recoil value was
        reasonable, I checked the recoil impulse, recoil velocity and
        recoil energy with the following assumptions:
 <P>
        1) The weapon is considered as kinetic energy weapon, so that
        all energy and mass is used to cause kinetic damage. (Plasma
        might have thermal effects, but assuming that the effect is
        purely kinetic will result to higher recoil.)
 <P>
        2) All the hydrogen fuel used in one shot is fired at target as
        a kinetic projectile. (Some of the fuel might be used as
        coolant, but assuming that all is used as projectile will result
        to higher recoil.)
 <P>
        I made a few sample weapon designs and checked the resulting
        recoil values against several existing weapons.

  The RFP-10 is a compact rapid-pulse fusion pistol, capable of
        firing two shots in a second. The weapon uses single-chamber
        plasma focus device to launch a high-velocity plasma sheath
        towards target. The firing unit is only 1.5 cm long, and the
        launched plasma sheath begins to spread so rapidly that the
        weapon is ineffective against bodyarmor beyond 30 m range. The
        visual effect of firing the gun resembles a directed explosion.

<p>        According to FF&S1 this fusion pistol has recoil value "14".

        One real-life weapon which has the same recoil values is the
        M2HB machine gun (12.7 mm BMG). The M2HB has recoil 14 when the
        weapon is fired at full-auto from hand rest (without tripod).
<p>
        The calculated recoil values for the fusion pistol (with above
        assumptions) are:
        Recoil impulse:  2.2 Ns
        Recoil velocity: 2.1 m/s
        Recoil energy:   2.3 J
<p>
        For comparision, the same values for a few sample pistols are:

        <tr><TD> .25  <TD>    0.8 Ns <TD> 3.6 m/s, <TD> 1.5 J

        <tr><TD> .380 <TD>    2.0 Ns <TD> 3.0 m/s, <TD> 3.0 J

        <tr><TD> .45  <TD>    4.1 Ns <TD> 3.8 m/s, <TD> 7.9 J

        <tr><TD> .44  <TD>    7.4 Ns <TD> 5.4 m/s, <TD> 20.0 J
        </table>
 <P>

        According to this, the fusion pistol should have roughly as much
        recoil as a .380 ACP pistol. In FF&S1 terms this should be about
        recoil "2". The final values for the fusion pistol are:
