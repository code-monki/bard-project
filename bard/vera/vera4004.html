The <I>Avenger</I> Battle Walker are fielded by the Auroran Special Forces.  The current <I>Avenger</I>'s design was based on battle walkers that were used by the Parity of Brothers.  The Parity of Brothers was a small Pocket Empire located in Malorn sector (rimward of Aldebaran).  It honored its mutual defense treaty with the Solomani Confederation by sending 10,000 troops to assist the Solomani in the defense of the newly conquored Old Expanses.  The troops were stationed on Aurora in 1125 and they were stranded on the planet when the Virus struck.  Since then the troops have merged with the planetary society.
<P>
The Auroran military used the battle walkers as defensive troops that could protect key military installations and the capital against raiders and Vampire incursions.  As the orignal walkers wore out, they were replaced by modern reproductions.  Since the founding of the Coalition, Aurora has replaced the <I>Avenger</I>'s original 5mm rotary autocannon with the RC standard HMG and upgraded the ballistic computers.
<P>
Aurora has approximetly 200 <I>Avenger</I>s Walkers, divided into three companies.  Their primary mission is still defensive, though Aurora has offered to second them to RC forces if requested.  As Aurora does not have any assualt ships capable of carrying the <I>Avenger</I>'s into battle, the offer has not been taken up yet.  A recent proposal suggested that small smash and grab missions could be assisted by a few <I>Avenger</I>'s.  The <I>Avenger</I>'s are fairly compact and would allow ships that do not have sufficient hangar capcity to carry grav tanks to at least have some armored support.  Of course the <I>Avenger</I>'s slow land speed would require the ship to land close to target.
<P>
The <I>Avenger</I>'s are man shapped walkers with twin 4-pack missile launchers mounted behind each shoulder.  The HMG is mounted in the belly of the <I>Avenger</I>.  The <I>Avenger</I>'s have a very smooth organic look to them and are very sleek in apperance.  (Think armor suits from Japanesse Anime, rather than Battletech.)  The <I>Avenger</I>s arms end in fully articulated hands.  The <I>Avenger</I>s are painted with smart paint which is usually configured in a camoflauge pattern.  The operator is situated in the main body of the vehicle, above the HMG.  The <I>Avenger</I>s are roughly 14 feet tall, 8 feet across and 5 feet deep.  (Because the standard vehicle configuration is a rectangular box, with the sides being the longest facing, I rotated the box upright so that the calculations to add armor to each facing would be correct.)
