  <HR><P><BR>

The goodlife of the Promise Defence Concert Grouping have prepared the PDC <I>Bulwark</I>
robotic vehicle for the Council's recent specification.<P>

We have taken the basic chassis of the Naasirka M4 <i>Slipper</I> Starport
Multibot and modified it to fulfil an area defence mission.<P>

Before we discuss the <I>Bulwark</I> further - we must consider the likely mode
of attack by the badlife infesting our orbital space. Scans have shown
ships with tubes for the use of drop troops - these will undoubtedly begin
the assault on our world. Freighters are also in the orbital fleet - these
will undoubtedly land heavy vehicles for an assault on Star City. We have
scanned for many microseconds though our historical databases and have
found that purely armoured assaults fail disastrously in the absence of
infantry troops. The destruction of troops in armour and in light vehicles
is the goal of the <I>Bulwark</I>.<P>

The <I>Bulwark</I> displaces 10 Kiloliters, is adequately armoured for it's role,
and has sufficient weaponry to destroy vehicles up to light g-tanks. It
has a top airspeed of 576 km/h when it's ducted fans and heplar are
engaged, and 201 km/h on just the fans. It can fly NOE at 144 km/h on both
propulsion systems, and 50.4 km/h on the fans. The Fans have an unlimited
use, as they are powered from the units fusion reactor, which has a half a
year's supply of fuel. The thrusters have just under three hours of fuel -
but it is intended to only be used in burst mode. It has a high-efficiency
contragrav system. Coupled the fans with it's EMM system results in a hard
to detect combat machine. <P>

It's main armament consists of the 12Mj Plasma Gun, which is mainly found
in the <I>Pyrrhus</I> Grav Tank, a vehicle on which we have much data. Equipped
with a point defence computer it can wreak devastation on descending drop
troop concentrations. Space limitations mean it can only carry 80 PPC
shells. Parallel with this is an extremely powerful laser gun, capable of
cutting through 2.5 cm of superdense out to 560 metres. This is fed from a
battery capable of powering 400 full-power shots - which is continuously
topped up from the vehicle's 3.3MW fusion plant - also adapted from the
<I>Pyrrhus</I>.<P>

The secondary armament utilises the manipulator  arms from the M4. The
bays that contain the two light and two heavy arms have been extended to
allow space for two 5cm TL9 laser pistols and two TL9 laser rifles
respectively, including their power packs. <P>

The robot also has a 30km area jammer for hit-and-run attacks on the
enemy.
<P>
The robot brain is the larger and cheaper TL13 high autonomous robot
brain. The higher performance variety was considered, but given the
focused role of the machine was deemed uneconomical.<P>

The operations envisaged are many. In addition to the aforementioned drop
troop screening, it can act as a quick response striker on troops and
light vehicles, engage craft in the atmosphere, and with suitable bases -
engage in guerrilla warfare against an entrenched enemy. In this last mode
it can be very effective, as all it would need to perform maintenance on
itself would be M9 memory modules, which it can insert itself. It has more
than enough excess power to recharge any robotic forces with it - and can
even carry a robot of less than 1300 kg using it's arms.<P>

We feel that this goodlife will excel in both fighting the enemy's forces
and providing support to our own forces. Working within the 50MCr budget
we can field 27 <I>Bulwark</I>s and buy an additional 6747 rounds of Plasma gun
ammunition. We must stress that this design utilises commonly known TL13
technology, and can be produced completely here on Promise. Technical data
follows.<P>
