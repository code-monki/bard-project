The GrPz-IV (Gegengravitatpanzerkampfvagen Mark IV) is a modular armored fighting vehicle, which can be fitted 
with large variety of weapons and equipment. The tank is a scaled down 
high-tech version of older Solomani GrPz-III, designed for lower cost 
and easier maintenance.<P>

The GrPz-IV consists of a 2.5 DT main hull which includes 1 DT modular 
socket. Any weapon system up to 1 DT (14 m<sup>3</sup>) can be carried internally, 
but larger systems may be placed in external turret.<P>

Before collapse the GrPz-IV was manufactured by Rheinmetall in Sachen 
(Saxe 1437 Solomani Rim) and by Aurora Boriolis in Viipuri (Vyborg 1540 
Solomani Rim). Modular weapon systems were available from several 
manufacturers.<P>

Variants: GrPz-IV was designed to be easily modified, and there was 
large number of standard and non-standard variations, ranging from MRL 
carrier to command vehicle.<P>


GrPz-IV Ls (Ls = "Laserstrahl") was one of the most common variants 
encountered during the Solomani Rim war. The main weapon is rapid-pulse 
X-ray laser, which is used mainly as anti-armor and orbital point 
defense applications. While X-ray lasers have poor atmospheric 
performance, GrPz-IV Ls can still penetrate the front armor of Imperial 
"Trepida" at 3000 km range<P>

While a single tank can be quite deadly, a command tank can turn a tank 
group into orbital point defense battery. The command tank has long- 
range sensors and can feed fire-control data to ther tanks using its 
master fire director.<P>

The Solomani troopers have sometimes build hedgehog stations around 
their bases by hooking up several tanks into external power sources and 
feeding them sensor and fire-control data form a MFD.<P>
