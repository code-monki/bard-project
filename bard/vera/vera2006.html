The MARTI (Multipurpose Amphibious Recon Tracked Infantry ) vehicle
<P>
The tracked vehicle is designed for use as an all terrain transport vehicles. The vehicle has two
track-driven cars. Both cars are made of reinforced fiberglass plastic. They are coupled by an
articulated steering assembly. The cars are steered by hydraulic cylinders in the steering
assembly. The front car contains the power pack (engine and transmission) 1 transfer, braking,
and steering systems.  The power is put in motion by a 4 speed automatic through a 2 speed
transfer case.
<P>
Both cars have their own differentials. The differentials transmit power to the track drive
sprockets.  The vehicle has a fording and swimming capability. When swimming, the vehicle is
propelled by the tracks. The cargo carrier provides standard tactical mobility over all types of
terrain and can carry cargo or passengers.

      <P>

The Multipurpose Amphibious Recon Tracked Infantry (MARTI) vehicle is a full tracked,
articulated vehicle designed to support infantry platoons and similar sized units during the
conduct of operations in arctic and alpine conditions. The MARTI can be used in all types of
terrain, such as trackless terrain, rock, boulders, bog, marsh and water and from arctic cold to
tropical heat. The system is a non-developmental item and produced in 4 variants; Cargo
Carrier; Command, Control, and Communications; Ambulance; and Flatbed versions. They are
for use in heavy snow and slush.
<P>
 MARTI, a Small Unit Support Vehicle, is actually two small, tracked vehicles coupled together. The front is
the driving compartment that carries the driver and three passengers. The rear is designed to hold 10
more people for a total of 14 soldiers with gear. It rides like a tank, but drives like a truck. MARTIs are
made with rubber tracks just for snow.
<P>
<I>"It's a pretty impressive vehicle with its 4x4 track drive capable of
taking 60 degree inclines,  floating  in the snow, and did I mention
it's amphibious (with a bilge pump & everything!)"</I> -  SGT "Breezy" Sondowitz

<B>Notes</B><P>
I fudged a couple of things here to make them come out right.  First off, the value given in FFS seems to indicate metal
tracks.  While still weighing in at a respectable mass, I figured that the rubber just couldn't weigh as much.  I figured that the
new tracks would weigh only about 35%of the weight of metal tracks (multiplier of 1.5 per Displacement ton) and, while not
based on any specific research, this seems fairly sound as my final weight figures balanced out about right.
The second thing I fudged was the fuel consumption.  While tracked vehicles are notoriouly bad on fuel consumption, I just
could not justify 4.8 miles to the gallon with this lightweight configuration.  So I halved the rate of consumption and again, the
figures lined out a little more realistically, as modern diesel engines in tracked vehicles get closer to this mark.
I forsee the MARTI as a fairly inexpensive vehicle that can be made almost anywhere and which can go almost anywhere.
IMTU, the RC makes these on almost every world and the RCES uses them a lot on bootstrap worlds, as well as remote
operations on others.
