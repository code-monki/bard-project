<hr>
   
   I have made some stats for a misted-gel flamethrower. As there are few
   relevant section in FFS for such weapon, I have ballparked and hand-waved my
   way through this. Again, my thanks to <cite>The Colonial Marines Technical Guide</cite>
   for tech support and inspiration.<P>
    TheM240 is a flamethrower designed to spray misted incendiary gel. It is
      based on a pre-Collapse agricultural chemical sprayer common on Oriflamme.
      It is rugged enough for military use but remains lightweight due to the lack
      of a heavy barrel or receiver mechanism. Fuel is carried in screw-in tanks
      that hold the fuel and propellant gas. It takes three actions to replace a
      fuel tank on the incinerator.
      The M240 has been undergoing advanced field trials with the Oriflamme troops
      on Spencer and they have ordered an additional 500 units for additional
      tactical evaluation with teams attached to the RC navy. Some people have
      protested the use of incinerators on the battlefield but the weapons are
      proving a valuable resource for the typically outnumbered marine forces.
      <P>
      The weapon is fired in 1 second bursts. The spray  affects the first target
      in the line of fire and then splatters, affecting all unprotected items in
      the original target¹s square. A person struck in this manner will be
      affected on all exposed areas.  Users are cautioned when using the
      incinerator in close quarters due to the splattering effects of the stream.
      Additional hits on a target do cause additional damage but do reset the
      duration of the fire. The liquid can be sprayed with the igniter turned off,
      allowing the fuel to saturate the target first.
      
        <P>
      The fuel tanks are armored (AV=1) but if punctured will explode with a burst
      radius of 15 meters. Due to the danger of explosion, all new tanks have
      thicker armor sleeves (AV=2, +.4kg) to protect against fragmentation and
      stray rounds.
         <P>
      In a 1G gravity field, the incinerator has a short and medium range only.
      The fuel cannot reach beyond that. The incinerator can achieve it¹s full
      range only in a microgravity or null-gee environment.
      The M240 is capable of spraying a wide variety of chemical agents and
      flammable substances. The most common is a high-energy hydrocarbon gel. It
      is referred to as napalm, regardless of its actual chemical composition.
      Oriflamme has recently begun production of a new chemical called Xamalax
      (see below) for increased effectiveness. In a pinch, the M240 can spray LP
      gas or liquid hydrogen. These are not effective as military agents but have
      proven useful for engineers, burial details or demolition teams who wish to
      set fires quickly from a distance. 
         <P>
      Xamalax is an incendiary chemical that burns at high temperature (1800C)
      and generates it¹s own oxygen supply while buring. It is shipped as a
      micro-fine powder and mixed on location with the oxgenated binder to the
      consistency of caulking.
      Xamalax will burn in thin, very, thin, tainted and corrosive atmospheres or
      underwater. It will even burn at half effectiveness in vacuum and
      near-vacuum conditions. Incendiary teams are cautioned when using Xamalax
      due to the great difficulty of putting out the fires generated by the
      chemical.
      Xamalax is both caustic and toxic: care should be exercised when shipping
      and handling Xamalax compounds.
         <P>
       
   	<h3>Napalm</h3>
   	Napalm does 1d6 damage per second and burns for 12 seconds. <BR>
   	It has a short range of 15 meters<BR>
   	Napalm costs 1 Cr/liter and weighs 1 kg/liter. It is slightly lighter than
   	water.
   	<P>
   	<h3>Xamalax</h3>
   	Xamalax does 2d6 damage per second and burns for 8 seconds.<BR>
   	It has a short range of 15 meters.<BR>
   	Xamalax costs 75 Cr/liter and weighs 1 kg/liter. It is slightly heavier than
   	water.
   	
   	<h3>Liquid Hydrogen</h3>
   	LHyd does 1d6 damage per second and burns only for the second it is ejected
   	from the incinerator.<BR>
   	It has a short range of 10 meters<BR>
   	LHyd costs 1 credit for 29 liters of the stuff and weighs 70 grams per
   	liter.
   		<P>
   	<h3>LP gas (or propane tanks)</h3>
   	LP gas acts in all ways as liquid hydrogen except that it costs and weighs
   	more.<BR>
   	It costs 1 credit for four liters and weighs one kg per liter (i'm guesing
   	here).
