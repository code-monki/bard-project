The <I>Knifejack</I> family of missiles are complex smart weapons, capable of being
fired and finding their targets without additional supervision. The family
of missiles all use the same warhead and similar seeker packages, with
different boosters added.
Note that the seeker head uses predominately the imaging radar to find
targets. However, if this is jammed or ineffective, the missile will
automatically switch to the backup visual sensor and attempt to acquire the
target.
<P>
The primary warhead type is the top-attack HEAP warhead. The missile can
also carry a .1 kiloton nuclear warhead but few of these warhead were made.
The <I>Knifejack</I> is used as a quick response missile. It has a short range but
high speed (3600kph), allowing it to engage targets before defenses can be
brought to bear.
<P>
The <I>Skipjack</I> acts as a long range missile, but maintains enough speed
(1000kph) to catch grav vehicles and slow aircraft.
The <I>Lazyjack</I> uses a two stage system designed to loiter over the 
battlefield searching for targets. The missiles have a cruising speed of
215kph and will engage in preset search patterns, looking for identifiable
targets. The sustainer motor has a duration of just over 30 minutes (367
combat rounds).
<P>
Once a target is identified the terminal booster accelerates the warhead
into the target at 3600 kph. <I>Lazyjacks</I> have had their secondary video
scanner replaced with a home-on-jammer package, allowing them to immediately
attack any jamming source that presents itself.

<H3>Notes:</h3>
Like all seeker weapons, the <I>Knifejack</I> series must be programmed before the
battle with data (enemy vehicle types, IFF transponders, priority targets,
zones of control, etc.). Without this programming, the weapon will not know
the difference between enemy tanks and friendlies in their search pattern!
The weapon comes with factory preset patterns, but these are not reliable
in specific field situations.
<P>
If the <I>Lazyjack</I> detects a ground target outside of its boosters range, it
will attempt to use any existing obstacles, such as hills or buildings to
cover its approach (without seriously deviating from its course). When it is
within its 5km attack range it will climb and attempt to engage to target
with its sensors. If the target has disappeared, it will return to its
search mode.
<P>
The <I>Lazyjack</I> will attempt to attack any viable target within range when its
sustainer motor has burned out. If there are no viable targets available the
weapon will self-destruct.
