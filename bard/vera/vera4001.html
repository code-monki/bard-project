 The <I>Masai</I> is the most popular model from a revival of walker technology in
 the Alpha Crucis and Spica sectors. Designed in 1086 as a multi-purpose
 military and exploration vehicle, the <I>Masai</I> became well known through
 several large mercenary purchases and a popular tri-V show featuring the
 walkers prominently. Almost 12,000 units were made, spread throughout three
 sectors.
 <P>
 The <I>Masai</I> sports an unusual spherical frame and it quickly earned such 
 clever nicknames as �Egg-On-Legs� or �Turb-Chicken�. Despite it's long
 limbs, grav compensation gives the <I>Masai</I> a smooth, comfortable ride at any
 speed.
 <P>
 The <I>Masai</I> can also be adopted for limited flight abilities with the addition
 of a flight conversion kit available. This addition proved to be very
 popular and became standard issue on later models. The stats below are
 listed with the kit. The following version has no additional features beyond
 the flight kit.

<h3>Notes</h3> 


 The <I>Masai</I>'s hull is a spherical design. As such, all armor facings require
 17% of the MVM for each cm of armor added. 
 The <I>Masai</I> has a power surplus of 2.043 Mw which can be used to power
 additional equipment.
 The flight kit includes high efficiency contra grav lifters, a TL13 St
 flight computer, flight avionics, terrain following sensors, HEPlaR thruster
 (providing 16.8 tonnes thrust), a reaction mass tank and fuel scoops along
 5% of it's body. The entire package uses 1.505 Mw of power and costs MCr
 .42. It weighs 1.432 tonnes and uses 6.785 cubic meters of space.
 The <I>Masai</I> has fuel scoops for refueling its flight tanks. As it has limited
 uses in a gas giant, the <I>Masai</I> typically refuels by dipping it's belly
 intakes into a nearby water source. The <I>Masai</I> has no capacity for refining
 the fuel.<P>
 
<B>Optional Rule:</B The legs of the walker are not encompassed by the CG field
 until they are folded against the body. If the lifters are turned on with
 the legs extended, this reduces the weight of a fully loaded <I>Masai</I> to 23
 tonnes. At this weight, the walker can theoretically reach speeds up to 490
 kph. In actuality, the transmission cannot go much over half that. While
 running at this rate cross-country, the pilot must make a difficult piloting
 check every combat turn or the walker will trip and spin out of control.
 Running the walker at this rate will add five maintenance points for that
 week due to the stress placed on the suspension and transmission.
 GM Note: This grav-sprinting can develop into walker racing: a fast and very
 dangerous sport. Skilled pilots can push their modified machines over 300kph
 but more than few lose control and �do the Humpty-Dumpty.� As such, walker
 racing commands a large following of sports fans across several systems.<P>
