The <I>Eternal Guardian</I>-Class is a massive aircraft. Its 
immense size is dicated by its power supply, a nuclear reactor. 
It can stay airborne for over 1 month at a time. It was originally 
designed as part of a nuclear deterent. It would be constantly 
flying, this way it would avoid being caught on the ground by a 
suprise attack. Upon recieving orders it could enter enemy 
airspace and deliver its nuclear payload. It would deal with 
enemy air defenses, with tactical nuclear weapons that would take 
out entire enemy air fields, and SAM sites.<P>

Many 
<!A HREF="../gail/gail####.htm">TEDs</A> in the Wilds have found 
other uses for such a massive weapon. It can be used as a 
propaganda weapon, constantly flying over rebellous provences and 
broadcasting propaganda, or jamming alternative viewpoints. Some 
<I>Eternal Guardians</I> have been equipped with video 
broadcasting suites, to increase the effectivness of the 
propaganda.  It can also be used for its original purpose, to 
bomb something into the stone age.<p>

 The plane was designed with
