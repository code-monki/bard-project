   "There isn't much I can say about this gun. It come to our posession
through a free-trader, who got it from who-knows-where."

"The gun is a 10mm ACR with build-in 30mm underbarrel grenade launcher.
It fires similar caseless ammunition as used in old Solomani M41 pulse
rifle."

"The action is a recoil-operated floating system, and has roughly similar
shock absorber as found in antique HKG11 assault rifles. The action can
be set to fire semi-automatic, fully automatic, or 3-round autobursts,
but the autofire recoil is quite strong."

"The launcher has tubular magazine and very simple semi-automatic feed
system. Individual grenades are pushed into the magazine through this
feed port, and a chambered grenade may be launched by pressing a
secondary trigger, located here, just under the main trigger in the
pistol grip. When the ACR is held in normal firing position, the user
may fire bullets with index finger and grenades with middle finger."

"The optic sight located on top of the carrying handle has two sets of
reticles. The ring reticle is used when firing bullets, and crosshairs
are used with grenade launcher. A folding ladder-sight can be used when
firing grenades on long ranges."

"The origin and manufacturer of the gun is unknown since there is no
markings except a six-figure serial number and figures '10Rk28' stamped
on the receiver housing."
