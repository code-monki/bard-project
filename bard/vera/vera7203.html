  The 2mm Needle design lacks the penetration and damage of
the Imperial standard 4mm round (and was only ever manufactured in dart
format), but its small size results in weapons with an awesome magazine
capacity and a round that still outperforms the standard 9mm pistol round
at most muzzle velocities.
<p>

Widely known as the Needler after the ammunition it fired, the 2mm
Gauss Pistol was in widespread Solomani service by 1100 Imperial.
Manufactured at a higher tech level than its carbine counterpart, the
Needler was a favoured sidearm for security forces and line troops facing
opponents with only light or no body armour. Intended for close quarters
battle, the Needler came complete with a 70 round grip magazine, a rate of
fire that no conventional pistol could hope to equal, and a recoil to
match. Optional extras for the design included a laser sight and a folding
stock that allowed its use in a machine-pistol role. Both were issued
widely and many users adopted one or the other simply for the reduction in
recoil that went with them, the increased accuracy was an additional bonus.<P>


    <B>Author's Note:</B> One thing that's pretty much overlooked in RC background is that
the Solomani occupation must have left significant chunks of Solomani
ordnance lying around. I designed a few Solomani small arms a while ago and
might as well throw them out to the list for savaging <g>. One thing I was
looking at was the actual mission requirements of the Solomani in an
invasion of the Imperial worlds in the Solomani Rim, and that means lots of
fighting in high population worlds where vehicles are going to be less
useful and internal security a major problem. Watching the civs is a good
job for the lower tech Solomani outfits, especially if you seed them with
some high tech goodies -- such as Needle pistols and Carbines:<P>
