<P>

Maybe this is not too much in topic for
this nebula contest, i completely failed
in creating anything that could be
standard imperial marine battledress.
<P>
Instead, I went with the recent
discussion of the style of imperial
marines operations. I picked the
"small numbers hold down the mob"
setting combined with high mobility
for boarding operations. Well - high
MOBility (4G), not high AGility (-4 AG).
The suit masses 480 kg...
<P>
Technically, this design exploits the
nasty-mini-meson-gun whole, build around
one of those nice little 200 kg reactors
you can contruct at TL 15, spiced up with
a big-show user interface. I don't think
reactor-battledress and minimesons are
good style, but the results are amazing.
Salvage one of these and build up a TED.

TL 15 projector suit

The name is derived from its main weapon,
the so-called meson projector: An array
of unreasonable high number of submicro
meson guns is set up to fire one after
another so that you get very high overall
firing frequency (200Hz). The meson pipes
are fixed on a flexible carriage so that
their relative directions can be adjusted.
The result is that all mesons explosions
can be concentrated in one point as well
as defocused to form a screen or a line
or whatever anywhere the operator wants
one. The exact form is controlled per
gestures. Note: a battledress is quite
good motion capturing equipment. If the
user does not only want to fire at this
or that target (then a virtual gunner
workstation is shown in the visors
holodisplay) he first forms a virtual
preview of the meson-wall with his
hands and then sets the distance by
targeting a reference point or by waving
the virtual wall in his display closer
or farther away. When he likes what he
sees he just has to make the trigger
command (configurable: clap, nod, make
a most offensive gesture..). In addition
to that the system controlling the
meson projector can be linked by radio
to other projector suits so that the
projectors are switched together as one
battery that can build a larger or
faster wall to control larger areas,
systematically drive persons out of a
building with a meson wall moving slowly
from back to front an the like.

<P>

Trained persons can do the targeting -
gesticulation quite fast, therefore the
nickname dancers, despite the fact that
the hughe reactor/projector backpack
makes them move very much like a drunken
cow. The grav compensator that is always
partially activated to reduce the
enormous wheight of the reactor
(carrying is not the problem - the
exosceleton does. But who wants to walk
20 degrees layed to the front?) makes it
even worse due to traction problems.

In low G environments the HePlaR manouver
drives of the suit are used to press the
marine to the "floor", if he likes he can
set artificial G in the suit to match the
amount the suit is pressed down. Skilled
marines even use the thrusters to run
around courners. Don't try this at home -
not at anyones home, except the enemy's.

History:

When Durch Ich., a sector wide supplier
of high tech meson communicators from
[insert favourite system here] decided
to broaden their product spectrum in
1110, they adopted experimental new
meson technology for weapon use. The
first product was a the Projector suit,
a ultraheavy battlesuit which was, as
rumours say first a given up prototype
design from LSP for a not less
experimental pioneer suit that Durch
bought cheaply.
<P>
From 1112 to 1114 Durch produced about
500 exemplars of the suit until it
became clear that the Projector was way
too heavy while beeing one of the worst
armored battledress on the market, had
only very short range weapons and was
of course wildly overpriced.
<P>
While now no one at Durch wondered why
LSP had sold the design so cheaply they
still weren't able to do better, so
Durch decided to retreat from the
battledress business. But then only a
few years later, when the market
exploded in the Final War and, after a
strike on the local LSP production
center, Durch suddenly was the only
battlesuit manufacturer in half of the
subsector about 4300 more were built,
most with slight modifications
sacrificing some sensors, the expensive
avionics and fuel capacity or even the
laser and its heavy HPG to pack on more
armor or make it lighter.
<P>
Today some examples have their fans
as they don't need any ammunition
(how I was tempted to include fuel
purification!), only loads of the most
qualified service one sadly cannot get
after the Collapse.
