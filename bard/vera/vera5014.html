      The <I>Hell Hound</I> was an Imperial-era design for a security robot.  The <I>Hell Hound</I>
          was shaped in the form of a large predator animal.  The surface of the robot
          was contoured and had an organic shape to it.  Normally <I>Hell Hounds</I> were
          a dark gun metal color, but the factory would color the robots other colors
          for a small additional fee.  The <I>Hell Hound</I> was outfitted with a large suite
          of sensors enabling it to detect intruders.  These include high-resolution thermal
          eyes with a range of 300 meters through all atmospheric conditions other than snow
          or rain, where it was only 150 meters.  It also has sonar ears, high and low 
          frequency ears and a ultrasonic motion detector.  These senses allow the <I>Hell Hound</I>
          to detect intruders in almost all conditions.  The <I>Hell Hound</I> can keep in touch
          with its home base and other units via a short range radio. The Hell Hound
          also has recording ears and eyes, so that a full record of its actions is kept.
          This is useful for legal prosecutions.  There have been some cases where 
          unscrupulous individuals have used <I>Hell Hound</I> units to hunt down individuals
          and broadcast the hunt live to spectators as entertainment. 
          <P>
          Unlike many security robots, the <I>Hell Hound</I> is not armed with a firearm, but rather
          powerful jaws. These jaws will not do much versus armored opponents, but the
          <I>Hell Hound</I> was not intended as a warbot, mearly as a sophisticated guard.If the
          <I>Hell Hound</I> encounter's armored individuals, it can contact either its owner or
          the police, depending on the owner's wishes.  Its high armor value, should allow
          it to survive long enough for the police to arrive.  In the mean time it can
          keep the police up to date on the intruder's whereabouts and actions.  
        <P>
		
		 The Jaws of Death are mounted on the neck of the robot, which was designed as an arm.  
		 The head of the robot contains all the sensors of the robots.<P>
