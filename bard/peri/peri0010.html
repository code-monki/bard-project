<H1>Ring Pact</H1>

<H5>by <A HREF="../../credits.html#Watters"> Eamon Watters </A></H5>

</CENTER><HR> 


Kandra subsector of Hinterworlds is home to the Ring Pact, a Defence and Trade 
organisation sponsored by the Hive Federation. Each member has it's
own needs and plans, but despite these centrifugal forces the Pact 
has held over the ten years of it's existence. Member worlds and 
possession of these worlds are indicate by a RP in the allegiance 
column.<P>

<H3>Worlds of the Pact</h3>


 <A HREF="opal97??.html"> Strom(3102)</A> <P>


Strom controls the following systems:<br>
<ul>
Exit(97??). This cemetery world is controlled by the military, and 
contains a Hiver Staging Base.<p>

Vizier(97??). This cemetery world has a frontier starport to support 
trade along the Elan Main.<p>

 <A HREF="opal97??.html"> Slider(3102)</A> <P>


Dodo(97??). Formerly known as Elan, this thin-atmosphered world perished 
in the collapse. It's numerous relics provided a boon to Strom, and 
to a lesser extent her neighbours. There are still recovery missions 
underway here, but the tempo is much less than when the Tech Rush 
started in 1147. this world has always been a sore point with Strom's 
neighbours, and even though it has been opened to outsiders, who need 
Dodo's TL-A equipment less and less, it still rankles.
</ul>
<A HREF="opal97??.html"> Leroy(3102)</A> <P>
<A HREF="opal97??.html"> Yoryunssoy(3102)</A> <P>

Leenitakot(97??) Site of the famous Leenitakot Ringworld, and inspiration for the naming of
the Ring Pact, it's Droyne inhabitants are notoriously easy-going.
Formerly a possession of the Outcasts of the Whispering Sky, it is now the
site of the Ringworld Research Institute, a Pact division. Although
incomplete, the massive structure has plenty of secrets and artefacts to
surprise investigators, many of whom travel from the Federation to
investigate it. The post collapse history of the world is quite similar
to Yoryunssoy's, save for the initial battles against their oppressive
Outcast overlords that wiped them from the face of the planet. It gets
reasonable cross-trade from Gammist to the Strom Cluster and the far end
of the Elan Main, and is more open about Psionic training then their
brothers, but less accomplished.

<A HREF="opal97??.html"> Gammist(3102)</A> <P>

 Gammist claimed some nearby
systems as it's own in response to Strom's expansion. They are:
<ul>
(1)<A HREF="opal97??.html"> Murmur(3102)</A> <P>


(2)Kearsage. This cemetery world serves only as a refuelling point for the
Jump-1 traffic on the Elan Main.
</ul>
Kervid URL
<A HREF="opal97??.html"> Kervid(3102)</A> <P>

Gamvina URL
<A HREF="opal97??.html"> Gamvina(3102)</A> <P>

Gamvina's colonies are:<ul>

(1)Sharina(97??). The only reason to visit this cemetery world is to use the
Scout Base located here. The Gamvina government hopes to use it to gain
riches recovering relics from the worlds of the Pusan-Bruia main. There
have been some notable successes, but recently ships have been
disappearing in the rimward section of the Main.
<p>
(2)Nerkaal(97??). This world is a link in the Jump-1 trade through the Elan
Main.<p>
</ul>


Driank(97??) A cemetery world, this system is only important because of the Ring Pact
Naval Base located here. A squadron of Hiver and Pact ships make sweeps of
the surrounding space from here. Many people consider it the best
achievement of the Pact so far.
