<H1>Ring Pact</H1>

<HR>

The Kandra subsector is home to the Ring Pact, a Defence and Trade
organisation sponsored by the Hive Federation. Each member has it's
own needs and plans, but despite these centrifugal forces the Pact
has held over the ten years of it's existence.  <P>

<h3>Member Worlds</h3>

<A HREF="../opal/opal6007.html"> Strom (1132)</A> Strom controls the following systems:<br>

<UL>
<LI>Exit (1134) - This cemetery world is controlled by the military, and
contains a Hiver Staging Base.<P>

<LI>Vizier (1233)- This cemetery world has a frontier starport to support
trade along the Elan Main.<P>

<LI><A HREF="../opal/opal6006.html"> Slider (1334)</A> <p>

<LI>Dodo(1335) - Formerly known as Elan, this thin-atmosphered world perished
in the collapse. It's numerous relics provided a boon to Strom, and
to a lesser extent her neighbours. There are still recovery missions
underway here, but the tempo is much less than when the Tech Rush
started in 1147. this world has always been a sore point with Strom's
neighbours, and even though it has been opened to outsiders, who need
Dodo's TL-A equipment less and less, it still rankles.</UL>

<A HREF="../opal/opal6004.html"> Leroy (1231)</A> <p>

<A HREF="../opal/opal6008.html"> Yoryunssoy (1235)</A> <p>

<A HREF="../opal/opal6003.html"> Leenitakot (1432)</A> <p>


<A HREF="../opal/opal6000.html"> Gammist (1435)</A>  Gammist claimed some nearby
systems in response to Strom's expansion.:<br>
<UL>
<LI>	<A HREF="../opal/opal6005.html"> Murmur (1436)</A> <p>

<LI>	Kearsage (1536) - This cemetery world serves only as a refuelling point for the
Jump-1 traffic on the Elan Main.

</UL>

<A HREF="../opal/opal6002.html"> Kervid (1532)</A> <p>

<A HREF="../opal/opal6001.html"> Gamvina (1632)</A> Gamvina's colonies are:

<UL>
	<LI>Sharina (1733) - The only reason to visit this cemetery world is to use the
	Scout Base located here. The Gamvina government hopes to use it to gain
	riches recovering relics from the worlds of the Pusan-Bruia main. There
	have been some notable successes, but recently ships have been
	disappearing in the rimward section of the Main.<p>

	<LI>Nerkaal (1634) - This world is a link in the Jump-1 trade through the Elan
	Main.<BR>

</UL>

Driank (1635) - A cemetery world, this system is only important because of the Ring Pact
Naval Base located here. A squadron of Hiver and Pact ships make sweeps of
the surrounding space from here. Many people consider it the best
achievement of the Pact so far. <P>
