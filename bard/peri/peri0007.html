<H1>Voskl Trade Alliance</H1>

</CENTER><HR> 

The Voskl Trade Alliance (VTA) is a loose confederation of worlds in the Voskl subsector
(D) of the Old Expanses. The primary aim of the alliance is to strengthen the economies
and raise the technological level of it's member states.<p> 

<h3>Member Worlds</h3>
<A HREF="../opal/opal9304.html"> Daslon (2705)</A> <br>
<A HREF="../opal/opal9302.html">Malcan (2707)</A> <br>
<A HREF="../opal/opal9303.html">Rusco  (2706</A> <br>
<A HREF="../opal/opal9301.html">Dycarl (2806)</A><br>
<A HREF="../opal/opal9305.html">Horejs (2907)</A> <br>
<A HREF="../opal/opal9300.html">Voskl  (3006)</A> <br>

<h3>Future of the Alliance</h3>
<A HREF="../opal/opal9300.html">Voskl's</A> view of the Alliance's future is that it will continue to trade
hi-tech equipment to the other members, slowly raising their TL, whilst theirs races
ahead with the relic technology they obtain in return. There isn't much the rest of the
alliance can do to oppose Voskl, but <A HREF="../opal/opal9301.html">Dycarl</A> sees itself as outstripping Voskl in 
tech level in a decade or so, given their original high level. They will not oppose Voskl
openly, but hope to launch their own recovery missions into the wilds in time.
Voskl's primary aim is to secure proper spaceship, and eventually starship production
