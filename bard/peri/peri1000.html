<H1>Empire of Solee</H1>

<hr>
<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The Empire of Solee is an aggressive, expansionist, Pocket
Empire with its activities contained largely to the coreward
regions of Shenk Sub-Sector, Old Expanses. </p>

<p>Possessing a small number of serviceable large scale capital
vessels and a number of other, smaller, jump capable ships, the
Empire of Solee represents possibly the single greatest threat to
the newly emerging Reformation Coalition in the foreseeable
future. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Political Wisdom</h2>

<p>Until recently Solee was governed by a relatively ineffectual
and highly corrupt, Representative Democracy. However, less than
ten years ago a number of high ranking Naval Officers, led by the
ambitious and talented Gabriella Ramstattan, staged a relatively
bloodless coup d'etat, replacing the unpopular former political
structure with a more efficient and streamlined military
government. </p>

<p>The new Soleean government began and aggressive series of
public works accompanied by a massive military build up. This
military build up culminated with the recommissioning of a number
of large scale, 30,000+ displacement tons, capital vessels. These
actions have served to make the new government wildly popular at
home. In spite of her efforts to stamp out the corruption that
pervaded the previous government, the newly proclaimed Empress of
Solee has been completely unable to deal with the situation. It
would seem that the concepts of bribery and shady political
dealings are too deeply ingrained upon the collective psyche of
the Soleean people. </p>

<p>Aggressive and competent, Gabriella Ramstattan, the Empress of
Solee, is deeply concerned with her own political future. She
realizes that as long as she continues to ride the wave of
popular support she remains relatively invulnerable. However,
with the recent turn of military fortunes her government is
experiencing, Solee has become bogged down in a pair of
protracted wars of conquest on the planets of Hindahl and
Marcena, the Empress has begun looking for other, easier
victories to keep her political fortunes afloat. </p>

<p>In early 1202 her fortunes have apparently changed for the
better when one of her larger naval vessels intercepted and
captured the RCN <i>Marathon Victrix</i>. For better or for worse
the Empress of Solee would appear to have finally found an enemy
worth fighting. </p>

<hr>

<p>Before the collapse Solee was the site of a large Imperial
Naval Facility, this facility was largely abandoned before the
Solomani invasion of 1118 and was quickly converted over for
Solomani use. Near the end of the war this bases importance
sky-rocketed as renewed offensives by both Margaret and Lucan
began to challenge Solomani claims through out the Old Expanses.
In 1130, in preparation for a large Solomani push, portions of
the 275th fleet and 187th reserve fleet had been moved into the
system. These fleets were comprised largely of Solomani vessels;
however there were a large number of captured ex-Imperial ships
filling out the ranks. On 215/1130 these fleets were infected and
quickly disabled by a 1a (Suicide Inducer) strain of Virus. </p>

<p>By 1195 Solee had made a number of critical breakthroughs in
the field of Virus detection and elimination. The next logical
step was to begin reconditioning the remains of the Solomani
fleets that had languished in orbit for the past sixty years. </p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

 <li>      Empress of Solee. &quot;Path of Tears&quot; lists her
        name as &quot;Christen Overtak,&quot; whereas Challenge
        #76 identifies her as &quot;The Empress of Solee, the
        Christen Overtak, Her Brilliant Majesty Gabriella
        Ramstattan.&quot; <p>This seems to indicate that
        &quot;Christen Overtak&quot; is an honorific title of
        some kind and as such I have chosen to refer to her as
        Gabriella Ramstattan.</p>


<li>Another possible source for spare parts for Solee in the
        near future is the original Imperial Depot at 1213 Old
        Expanses. Barely eight parsecs, six jumps with a J-2
        ship, away this Depot was quickly captured by the
        Solomani in the early phases of the Rebellion and
        remained in their hands throughout the duration of the
        war. It is possible that a large number of Imperial and
        Solomani Capital Vessels remain in that system awaiting
        salvage. Though it is likely Virus has looked upon this
        Depot as a &quot;breeding ground&quot; indicating a high
        probability of Vampires throughout the system, it is also
        equally likely that large numbers of these vessels were
        simply shut down awaiting refit when Virus spread
        throughout the system.
