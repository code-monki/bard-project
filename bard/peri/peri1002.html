<H1>Cornation Speech</H1>

<hr>
An excerpt from a speech given by the Empress on the anniversary of
her cornation in 1198.<p>
<ul>

There was an Empire here once.  A thousand-thousand worlds united under
a single banner, behind a single leader.<p>

For a thousand years the Empire grew, prospered, expanding the boundries
of known space, bringing light into the darkness.  But then something
happened, something changed and the very soul of the Empire itself was
corrupted.<p>

Brother turned against sister, father against son and the Empire was
consumed in flames.  The fought a war, not a noble war to preserve the
Empire against its enemies, but a cowardly war against themselves.  A
war which they all hoped to win, but all knew they would lose.  And so
it was that the thousand year old Empire fell and darkness once again
returned to the stars.<p>

Perhaps the Empire was flawed from its inception, a poorly constructed
home just waiting to collapse, perhaps its leaders were corrupted by
their own vainglorious aspirations and power.  Whatever the reason, know
that we, the people of Solee, are the children of that Empire and that
one day we shall return to those stars and reclaim what was once ours. 
We shall not fail and we shall not be corrupted, the stars were ours and
they will be ours again.<p>
</ul>
<Ul><ul>

					Gabriella Ramstattan I<br>
					Empress of Solee, NE -2<p>
