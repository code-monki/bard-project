      Following On the heels of the <I>Marathon Victrix</I> incident the Solee
Imperial Fleet CNO, Admiral Eshraa bint Reine assembled her cadre of Captains
and commanders in the spring of 1202. A new enemy lay on the horizon,
originating out of Oriflamme and Aubaine subsectors from their interrogation
results of the RCES crew, as well as intelligence gleaned from their ship.
They were organized, but apparently slack on discipline, and had the aide of
the Hivers ( a blow to those who held onto the mythos of Margaret's Dream,
and ammo for the Human supremacists against these "treacherous" aliens).
             <P>   Solee was committed on Hindahl and Marcena with its troops.
The situation called for closure, before tackling this new foe. The Empress
demanded results. Bint Reine, chafing under the popularity of RAdmiral Von
Kessel's successes in Jayna since his taking command of that subsector in
1200, was determined to do just that. Get results, at any price, preferably
cheaply, but ruthlessly. <P>
 More men were needed, the Solee ground commanders argued, and more Fleet
support. Since Hindahl' s TEDs had agreed to shun nuclear technology, and it
was deemed politically a bad thing to use them, even tactically sized there,
something else had to be utilized. But since 1201, Solee had been improving
her starport capabilities, thanks to holding the Depot system, and the
reproduction of hull forming machinery & grav slips for orbital
construction.  Several more ships had entered service, and as of Jan 1202,
Solee began building her own SDBs.
Operation Heavenly Fire-Hindahl <P>
     First came Hindahl, where Solee had been the longest (since 1198).  Admiral
Bint Reine made excellent use of the newly outfitted CS-Bulk freighters with
their new Jump drives, and SIS's propaganda agents disguised as an itinerant
priests of the Technological Renunciation Church. These agents went forth
and preached a doomsday message into the lands hostile to Solee & her ally,
even as asteroids were being gathered up from Marcena's system by Admiral Bint
Reine's TF-"Heavenly Fire", consisting of two of these vessels, while the
second two brought forth Soleean Air Force crews and CAC to the system over
a period of four-six weeks. The Miners on the small world of Einsplatz
received their comeuppance from Solee's military in the form of VX nerve
gas, and laser Guided munitions into their caves. Col. Franz Heinrici of
Hindahl surrendered after six days of intense bombardment wiped out over
three quarters of his troops, and half the population. Admiral Bint Reine had
those under arms shipped off to Sovtor. Anyone found concealing a weapon was
shot. Survivors were shipped to the main world to Nova Schwanstein for
internment.  Einsplatz became a Soleean military outpost in system
thereafter. <P>
            On Hindahl, the Soleean's had amassed an air armada the likes
the local population hadn't seen since the war. In three days, all of the
nations that had resisted lost their navies, and their air forces to the
superior Planes and pilots from Solee. All 3 Guild client nations, Wurzburg,
Dortmund, and Schellenberg lost their ability to wage war, and any pretext
of air power. On the 4th day of this renewed offensive, the two freighters,
loaded with asteroids entered Hindahl system and moved to orbit.  The Mystic
Dictator, August Liebowitz,  (and head of the Technological Renunciation
church) of Nuremwald was preaching against the false prophets (SIS agents),
when his state was destroyed by meteors. Seven million of fifteen million
perished that day, including the Reverend Liebowitz.  Solee's ally Nova
Schwanstein took their cue and warned of impending meteors with their off
world supplied Radars. If those warring sides laid down their arms, they
would "shoot down in space" with off world missiles the impending threat.
       <P>   Those states that dismissed and scoffed those warnings were
demolished in the next four days, beginning with Wurzburg, Baumwald,
Skodawerken, Kruppgewehr, and Helmholtz. Millions more perished, and the
resistance versus Nova Schwanstein melted, as the death toll mounted. The
six neutral states begged to be spared, and miraculously, they were, as Nova
Schwanstein moved in with its "radars" and troops to man the PAD missiles.
The once enemy states of Bitburfeld, Nova Friesland, Nova Prussia, and
Krumlfeld saw the handwriting on the wall, and yielded.  At that point,
Hindahl was pacified. Solee's Air Marshal, Gunter von Hastattan, declared
the crises over on Nova Schwanstein's radio, and that all remaining
asteroids from this comet, had been destroyed (The Soleeans had run out, and
had gone back to reload). Schellenberg, Wurzburg, and Dortmund were
demilitarized, and Ministers of the TRC faith were imprisoned for "preaching
against technology which cost so many lives in their Ignorance". Wurzburg's
leader, Vicar Bruno Liebowitz (elder brother of August) the head of the TRC
was tried as a war criminal for, "putting ideology above the World's safety"
, in March of 1202, and hanged 1st week of April. Also in April,
"peacekeeping troops" from Kmak had arrived and relieved the Soleean forces
on the main world. <P>

<H3>Operation Meteor-Marcena</h3>
            Marcena was next on Admiral bint Reine's list, and as soon as the
situation on Hindahl stood down, bint Reine brought the majority of Solee's
fleet to bear, some 6 MC's and 20 SC's, as well as the new ASLT ships, and
asteroid packed bulk freighters in mid march of 1202.  Part of her homework
had been completed in the previous year with tighter interdiction of the
system, and New TL-9 weaponry and electronics systems integrated in
El-Marcena's military (particularly Anti-ballistic missiles, anti-submarine
ship-to-ship missiles (wet fleet), laser-guided munitions for aircraft,
cluster anti-armor & personnel munitions bombs, several hundred TL-8/9/10
Energia-class Air cushion Tanks, and TL-8 anti-armor attack helicopters
(Hind-G models). <P>
         The war on Marcena had slowed to skirmishes and commando raids,
frequent artillery missile exchanges of conventional warheads, most often
shot down by the Soleean ABM batteries provided. Solee's ally with a navy,
the island-continent state of San Jose, was plagued by several foes
submarine services, namely Del Rio, El Barone, and Santa Ana. With TL-15
densitometers salvaged from Depot, Admiral Bint Reine was ready to go after the
elusive relic TL-11 & TL-9 PAD subs of these three nations.  First she
knocked out the GPS TL-7 satellite system with small subcraft teams in armed
modular cutters and Termagant Ftrs, replacing them with TL-9 satellites
their allies alone could access, in 1201. The WA (World Alliance) nations
attempted to launch more of their own, but had them successfully shot down
by ABM's from San Jose & El Marcena. The WA nation of Esteban was completely
bogged down with the Guerrera insurgency, as the Basque natives there proved
to be the most resilient foe the Estebanian's had ever encountered, even the
children thrust grenades at their men, dumped sugar in petrol tanks, and
sold food with ground glass in it to their men. <P>
           In the third week of March 1202, Operation Meteor began, from the
ground. The Soleean TL-9 GPS satellites were also equipped with jamming
devices, and these were selectively switched on and off over their target
nations of the WA. Using data taken from aerial reconnaissance and their
satellites, El Marcena, and San Jose's Soleean led Missile commands struck,
with Solee's ships in orbit giving the SS-ICBMs their final laser guided
commands detonated a series of neutron bomb MIRVs (TL-8/9) over Del Rio's,
main Naval installations, airbases, and ground forces installations. Esteban
's, Juarez, Cordoba's, and Vasquez's airbases, and ground forces
installations, and communications central networks met similar fates. The
capital of Del Rio, Nova Madrid, was nuked by a single 5ktn meteor from near
orbit, as was the capital of EL Barone. <P>
        Also on the ground while these paralyzing attacks were under way,
the newly equipped El Marcenan Army utilized its new TL-9 arsenal to deadly
affect, with the Soleean TL-10 Grav Brigade in the vanguard. The MRL's laid
waste to the entrenched  & dug in forces, and were aided by orbital missile
submunition strikes from Solee's missile laden fleet.  Nerve gas, and
tactical neutron bombs for the 20cm rocket artillery wreaked havoc, and the
El Marcenan armies smashed Juarez & Vasquez's armies. <P>
         The Navies of the three nations attempted to launch counter strikes
from their carriers, and they were sunk as they attempted to launch their
armed aircraft, by orbital meson fire, and Space borne Ftrs from Solee,
bearing TL-9 anti-ship cruise missiles. <P>
   The Densitometer-equipped ships tracked the PAD subs and as they
attempted to contact ground stations for localized launches, they were
pinpointed and destroyed. <P>
    Two days later, the World alliance was in ruins, 50 % of their
populations or more of the targeted states were killed, and their militaries
had ceased to exist. Esteban's surviving government surrendered on the
morning of the third day. Del Rio was occupied by Soleean drop shipped
troops, as they had no government to surrender with. <P>
    Any Guild members caught planetside, were arrested, and all assets
seized. Mop Up and policing the dead and wounded was left to El Marcena,
which airlifted in its forces, as San Jose's navy conducted various
amphibious landings into El Barone and other coastal nations on the main
continent. <P>
                The Two TEDs of El Marcena, Duchess Anne Marie de Seville, &
Generalissimo Hector Rodriguez-Guerra were united by marriage of state, the
second week of April 1202. On the last week of April, Marcena's newly
trained graduates took over their space forces, and took delivery of a small
squadron Of TL-9/10 SDB's. The Empress Solee was pleased, and withdrew all
but cadre forces from the main world, after demilitarizing all but their
loyal allies, of everything but police forces in May 1202. The Security
divisions of both nations, keeping their Veteran & experienced troops for
planetary defense, provided for these "security forces". The Basque state of
Guerrera was glad to see the Estebanians defeated and leave, but they
remained a contentious, insular lot. <P>
         Admiral bint Reine's strategies here were to see use again in Shenk,
utilizing limited nuclear war (neutron bombs) to maximum effect against
populations of resistance. The cost cutting measures of asteroid bombing
also were to be repeated. Marcena's ecosphere suffered a bit after the two
meteorites over Del Rio, and El Barone, but the people who survived were all
too aware that surrender, and living under new governance was better than
vaporization. C-class starports were begun for both San Jose and EL Marcena
beginning of May 1202. They were completed in the spring of 1203, ten months
later.
