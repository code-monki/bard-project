   The TIDIs are the core of what the OBD is about.  Jordan firmly
believes that building trade among the worlds of the AO is more important
than political or military integration.  To that end, the OBD looks for
markets that these worlds can supply in the RC or on other worlds in the
AO.  OBD has begun a hand-me-down project for industrial equipment.  They
take machines that are becoming obsolete on RC worlds and transfer them to
the more advanced worlds in the Wilds in exchange for their own industrial
equipment which is transfered to more primitive worlds in the Wilds. 
Currently, Transstar sends its technical advisors to Lancer and Vezina,
while Vezina and Lancer in turn provide advisors to the nation of Borea on
Nicosia.  The facilities on Vezina and Lancer are currently producing a
variety of valves, seals, industrial fasteners and the like for export to
Aubaine and Trybec.  The Nicosia project is not yet operational, but is
initially slated to produce high quality wood furniture for sale on
Aubaine, where wood is scarce.  Not only do planets in the Wilds benefit
from these projects, but the worlds of the RC are able to shift production
from labor-intensive consumer and light industrial goods to the
technology-intensive capital goods that are in shortest supply. <p>
    The relic-prospector supply depot on Buhle was the first facility OBD 
opened.  It is provisioned on an irregular basis from Fija as shipping is 
available.  Transstar provides needed supplies to the various expeditions 
on the planet and also transports to Fija and brokers at auction any 
relics they find.  Jordan knows that while prospectors of any kind rarely 
make money, those who supply them frequently make a good deal of it.  
This is not the type of venture Jordan is particularly interested in, but 
it is an immediate source of revenue he can use to partially off-set his 
investments in TIDIs.  While the Board is behind the OBD, they consider 
it an experiment, so Jordan is on a short financial leash.
   <p>  Jordan also sponsors what he calls "Warm Recoveries."  These missions 
involve extracting large and semi-fixed relic industrial equipment that 
may be beyond the ability of Free Traders to recover or locals to 
utilize.  Consistent with his philosophy and the work necessary for these 
operations, Jordan enlists the consent and cooperation of locals by 
trading surplus capital goods from the RC that the locals can use for the 
relic machinery that they can't use.  Transstar provides skilled 
personnel to uninstall and prepare the relic equipment for shipment 
without damaging it, then trains native technicians to use the new 
equipment from the RC.
   <p>  Jordan's plans for the future are to expand his TIDIs further into the 
AO, and to conduct exploratory trade missions into the nearby subsectors 
of Alpha Crucis. <p>
