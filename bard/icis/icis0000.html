<A NAME="HISTORY"><H3>HISTORY</H3></A>

Transstar was the largest and only Solomani Megacorporation. It 
was a subsidiary of the Solomani party, and served as a source of 
income for the party.  Founded in 875, it was originally 
established as a means to foster trade and commerce between 
worlds of the Solomani Confederation.  Throughout most of its 
history it derived most of its profit from interstellar trade, 
but it did branch out, primarily into finance and insurance.<P>

After the Solomani Confederation conqured the Old Expanses during 
the early parts of the Second War for Solomani Liberation, they 
sent in fleets to adminstrate the territory, they also sent in 
Transstar to shape the economy of the new territory. As it was 
owned by the Party, Transstar ships were also used as Naval 
Auxilury ships, and were pressed into service carrying troops and 
supplies. Transstar bought up and otherwise aquired dozens of 
former Imperial Corporations.  The thought was that if you 
controlled a person's livelihood, you controlled the person.  
Also, why let profits go to Imperial Corporations and Imperial 
sympathizers when the profits could go to the Party.<P>

By 1130 Transstar had established itself as an integral part of 
the Old Expanses economy.  When the Virus hit the Old Expanses in 
1130 it wiped out most of Transstar along with the rest of 
Civilization.  Fija weathered the Virus better than most worlds.  
It lost technological levels, but remained rather calm.  From a 
base on Fija Transstar continued to operate throughout the Short 
Night. Transstar maintained several starships during the Short 
Night.  The starport on Fija was unable to repair jumpdrives, so 
after a decade Transstar was unable to keep the ships 
jumpworthy.  They mothballed several but kept two in service.  
They were the 2000-ton 
<A HREF="../sara/sara7000.html"><I>Pride of Terra</I></A> and the 400-ton 
<A HREF="../sara/sara7001.html"><I>Hokka</I></A>.  In 1177 the 
<A HREF="../sara/sara7001.html"><I>Hokka</I></A> was exploring the outer 
Fijan system and suffered a catastrophic drive failure and the 
entire crew slowly starved to death.  The crew kept up a live 
video feed throughout the entire disaster. Millions watched the 
tragedy on live trivid. After this Transstar kept the 
<A HREF="../sara/sara7000.html"><I>Pride of Terra</I></A> close to Fija.  
Transstar took great pride in that they had the largest function 
spacecraft on Fija, and they let people know about it in their 
advertisments.  When the Hivers contacted Fija in 1192, they sold 
Transstar parts to repair the 
<A HREF="../sara/sara7000.html"><I>Pride of Terra</I></A>.  The first 
mission of the revitilized 
<A HREF="../sara/sara7000.html"><I>Pride</I></A> was the recovery of the 
<A HREF="../sara/sara7001.html"><I>Hokka</I></A>.  
Transstar broadcast the recovery and turned it into a public 
relations bonanza.  When they returned to Fija, the dead 
crewpeople of the 
<A HREF="../sara/sara7001.html"><I>Hokka</I></A> were given a heroes 
funeral.<P>

Transstar slowly began to restart interstellar trade between Fija 
and the other members of the Dawn League. By 1201 they run ships 
between all the worlds of the Reformation Coalition. They have 
about a dozen relic ships, and have several new ones on order 
from Standard Astronics shipyard on Aubaine.  They are also 
pursuing negotiations with several Free Traders to purchase their 
ships and to hire the crews on as permament employees.  
<A HREF="../sara/sara7000.html"><I>The Pride of Terra</I></A> is still 
the flagship of the fleet, and was recently completly refitted at 
Dawn Construction's Shipyard on Trybec.<P>

<A NAME="STRATEGY"><H3>CORPORATE STRATEGY</H3></A>

Transportation continues to be the number one industry for 
Transstar, but they are diversifing. The leadership has 
instituted a major expansion. They relize that best time to 
expand is while the Coalition is still in its infancy, this way 
they can gain an early lead, and be in a posistion to squish 
future competition.  Their insurance firm on Fija insures 30% of 
the Coalition civilian starships.  They have a minority intrest 
in KruyterCorp.  They recently bought the leading manufacturer of 
machine tools on Baldur.  Recently they launched a hostile 
takeover of Standard Astronics, the owner of the shipyards on 
Aurora, which will soon be the second most important shipyard in 
the Coalition. As only it and Aubaine will be able to produce 
jump-2 vessels. The leadership wants Transstar to be a 
Megacorporation once again.<P>

Transstar does not condone illegal operations by its executives, 
like so many Imperial Megacorporations seemed to.  Its corporate 
environment was much more used to being the Law, as it was part 
of the government.  Outside of the of the Reformation Coalition, 
its respect for local law is a bit less, but still rather high 
for a Megacorporatioin.<P>

Technically Transstar is still owned by the Solomani Party, but 
as no one knows if it even exists anymore, Transstar operates 
independently, it reinvests most of its profits, setting aside a 
small fraction in case the Solomani Party makes a reappearence.  
Since it does not have to pay dividends to shareholders, it has 
a small advantage over traditionally owned corporations.   It has 
been putting this advantage to good use, buying up and forcing 
opponents out of business, when ever possible. This has caused a 
bit of a public relations problem as Transstar moves into small 
markets, displacing local business.  For the largest part 
Transstar has dealt with this by offering lower prices and better 
services.  It figures it can operate on a smaller profit margin 
in the short run to insure long term profitablity.<P>

Transstar has a very good relationship with its employees.  
Transstar pays very well and has a excellent benifits package.  
In its entire history Transstar has never laid off an employee, 
even through the Hard Times, and the Short Night.  Transstar will 
spare no effort to avenge or rescue employees that are captured 
by terrorists, rebels or others. In exchange for these benifits, 
Transstar demands excellence, and 110% effort.  Transstar also 
believes in advanced training  for its employees, and pays for 
them to get advanced college degrees.<P>

Transstar is a fervant supporter of the Reformation Coalition; 
you can't have trade without civilization.  Transstar supports 
the Centralist position, they would prefer to build up the 
Coalition, rather than admitting dozens of low tech worlds that 
would drain resources from the core worlds.  They do want new 
members, but at a slower pace.  They would also rather expand 
rimward, towards Terra.  But the Federalists seem to want to go 
towards the Imperial Core.  Transstar  donates money to 
Centralist politicians and offers them other favors, such  as 
free trips on Transstar shipping.<P>

There are persistant rumors that Transstar's leadership still 
subscribes to the Solomani Cause, and that they give money to 
various right wing groups such as the 
<A HREF="../dani/dani8000.html">League of the Imperial Way</A>.  The 
leadership denies these, but the rumors still persist.<P>

<A NAME="STRUCTURE"><H3>CORPORATE STRUCTURE</H3></A>

The current incarnation of Transstar is headquartered on Fija.  
It has a large complex located in the capital.  The 
Transportation Division and the Finance Division are located 
here.  The Transportation Division has local headquarters on 
each world in the Coalition, and on several worlds in the Wilds 
including Lancer/Aubaine, Kal/Oriflamme and Teldora/Oriflamme. 
These headquarters are charged with securing cargos for the ships, 
arranging passengers and other business.<P>

The corporation is headed up by a President who is selected from 
20 members of a Board of Directors.  The Board of Directors 
select a President by ballot.  New members to the Board are 
selected by current members of the Board. Members serve until 
they retire.  The membership is not responsable to anyone but 
themselves.  The Board meets monthly on Fija.  Board members 
travel throughout the Coalition making deals and furthering the 
corporation.<P>

Transstar doesn't have a large security apparatus.  It has a few 
security consultants, who design security systems for the various 
corporate facilites.  It does employ security guards to protect 
factories and plants that require protection.  It doesn't have a 
private army, or intelligence service. If a need arises, 
Transstar often hires reliable Freelancers.  It has enough 
contacts inside the RCES to know who is reliable and who isn't.<P>

<A NAME="ADVENTURE"><H3>ADVENTURE HOOKS</H3></A>

<DL>
<DT>Hostage
<DD> A member of the Board of Directors has been kidnapped by 
Guild/terrorist/or other criminal group.  They threaten to kill 
the member if not paid a ransom. Transstar needs a reliable group 
of Freelancers to rescue her.<P>

<DT>Rescue
<DD>A Transstar ship exploring new trade opportunities in the 
Wilds is overdue and persumed lost.  Transstar requires a 
Freelancer group to find out why the ship dissapered, and if 
possible punish those responsible.  It could be the standard 
Virus/TED/Guild villian or the ship may have simply broken down 
and needs the players to get spare parts for it.  Or it may have 
misjumped and no trace of it will ever be found.<P>

<DT>Investigation
<DD>A dedicated reporter believes that the Transstar Board of 
Directors is providing funding for Human Supremist terrorists 
that have been attacking Schalli.  She wants the players to help 
her break into the corporate headquarters on Fija, find evidence 
supporting her claim, and expose Transstar.<P>

<DT>Terra or Bust
<DD>Transstar wants to know the fate of Sol, and is mounting an 
expedition. Several Transstar executives are heading up the 
expedition.  Transstar is sending several armed ships. Togethor 
they stand a better chance of survival in the Wilds. They are 
hiring Freelancers to act as scouts and security.  It is possible 
that someone on board doesn't want the expedition to succeed, and 
will attempt to sabatage the expedition.<P>

<DT>Executive Action
<DD>A member of the Board of Directors disagrees with current 
corporate strategy, and wants to replace the current President 
with himself. He is hiring disreputable characters to assasinate 
the President and several other Directors.  The Directors are 
vacationing at an island resort on Aubaine. The players could be 
the assasins or catch wind of the attempt and try to stop it.<P>

<DT>Annoying Passanger
<DD>A member of the Board of Directors needs reliable 
transportation to a nearby planet, to close a deal. The next 
Transstar ship won't leave for another week, and that isn't soon 
enough.  The Director would annoy the crew with his questions 
about everything.  But if the crew deals with the Director 
politely and they manage to impress him/her they might walk away 
with an subcontract to carry freight for Transstar, which could 
lead to all sorts of other adventures.<P>

<DT>Corporate Rival
<DD>A rival corporation has been resisting Transstar attempts to 
take over its territory. A new corporate executive dealt with 
this by hiring thugs to kill the head of the rival corporation. 
This worked fairly well, in fact so well that the local 
authorities investigated. The executive fled the area, but the 
local media has gotten a hold of the story and Transstar's name 
has been besmirched, the Board of Directors wants the executive 
found and brought to justice. This will show that Transstar 
doesn't support his actions. <P>
