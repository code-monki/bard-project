Black Dawn LRC is a customer focused, interstellar enterprise
principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture
and integration of advanced technology systems, products, and
services for government and commercial customers. Black Dawn LRC
operates in the same context as its customers and is deeply involved
in solving the problems and meeting the demands and expectations of
its customers. Moreover, it leads the way in showing customers new
systems-based possibilities and opportunities.
<P>
The Corporation's core business areas are systems integration,
aeronautics, space, and technology services. Black Dawn's vision is
to be a leading research and development incubator in aerospace,
defense and technology services; to be the company our nation and its
allies trust most to integrate their largest, most complex, most
important advanced technology systems. Our goal is to provide the
best value to our customers, growth opportunities to our employees,
and superior returns to our stockholders.
<P>
Black Dawn LRC had 1201 sales of 240.2 Gigacredits and employs
approximately 35,000 people. Our main offices are located on
Karst/Namidshur, but we have labs and yards located across the
Regency, and consulting and coordination facilities located in
several of the Regency's allies and neighbors.
<P>
Ever since the company was founded, it has been commited to a strong
ethical course. We value our reputation, our customers and
shareholders trust, and the character and integrity of our employees,
and see all of these as a part of a greater vision that assimilates
corporate responsibility with corporate profitability.
<P>

Black Dawn LRC's symbol is of an Imperial Sunburst, with a
superimposed image of a shadowy raven. It is a double symbol. The
raven is a warning against self-righteous sanctimony, but it is also
a sign of regeneration, for a bird surround by the sun is also the
Chinese phoenix.
