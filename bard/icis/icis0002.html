<A NAME="HISTORY"><H3>HISTORY</H3></A>

Dushgin Starship was a small independent starship manufacturing 
yard located in the Vras System (Old Expanses 0739 A78A773-F).  
Dushgin Starship was a privately owned small company that 
encountered cash flow problems during the starship boom of 1087.  
Ling Standard Products purchased the yard and retained the 
existing management and Dushgin became a major producer of 
starships in the Old Expanses Sector.  Dushgin specialized in 
small craft and starships (under 500 displacement tons) with its 
specialty being 100-ton craft and smaller.  Compared to many of 
her sister yards (including the larger Nicosia Yards located in 
the Nicosia system), Dushgin was a small operation.  Most of the 
other Ling Shipyards can build anything from 100 to 10,000 
displacement tons.  As Dushgin�s orders increased, the management 
utilized Ling�s capital to pre-order many of the components 
required to construct the smaller spacecraft that had become 
Dushgin�s bread and butter.  At the same time, Dushgin purchased 
a small moon orbiting the gas giant in the Vras system.  All of 
the components were housed in the warehouse facility located on 
the moon, called Dushgin�s moon.  In addition to the orbital 
shipyards, Dushgin constructed a surface construction sight in 
Vras� southern ocean to construct many of the spacecraft that it 
had backordered.  During the Final War, Dushgin received a 
contract to design and build sixteen 400-ton SDB�s for Vras.  
Most of the materials were pre-purchased and stored in the 
warehouse on Dushgin�s moon.  By 1130, five of the sixteen had 
been completed and three others were under construction.<P>

In late 1130 when Virus reached Vras and infected the five SDB�s, 
two of the five destroyed themselves and the orbital facility.  
The other three destroyed parts of Dushgin�s moon warehouse by 
crashing.  The surface facility fared much better.  Its computer 
was down for minor repairs and the plant was unmanned when Virus 
arrived, so all the systems were untouched when Virus invaded 
the planet�s network.  The destruction of the planet�s power 
grid; however, severely limited Dushgin�s production capability.<P>

After Virus wiped itself out and the main cleanup/rescue 
operations were complete, Dushgir resumed the production of the 
30-ton cargo tender it had been working on at the surface 
facility.  Production was severely slowed because the only power 
source available was the tenders power plant.<P>

It wasn�t until early 1132 that  the 30-ton cargo tender was 
finished.  The tender was sent to Dushgin�s moon to salvage what 
was left of the materials there.  When the tender arrived at the 
moon, it discovered that there was much less damage than 
originally anticipated.  Three J-1 Free Trader type ships were 
intact, left on planet awaiting final payment before delivery.  
Two J-1 Scout/Courier type ships (property of Delgado Trading, 
LIC, docked pending repainting and minor repairs) were found 
intact.  The Jump drive parts warehouse had been destroyed, as 
had the main office building and parts of the electronics and 
maneuver parts warehouses as well.  The J-1 ships were taken to 
the planet as were many of the parts and a few in-system cargo 
tenders.  Dushgin lent the three J-1 ships to the Vras branch of 
Delgado Trading, LIC to add to the two they had repaired to help 
maintain a loose network of trade with Fuetz, and later (in 1139) 
with Schall.  Much of the limited ability of the surface facility 
were committed to maintaining the small fleet of J-1 boats.<P>

By 1143, the management of both Dushgin Starship and Delgado 
Trading began negotiations to merge the two companies, believing 
that they were all that was left of their respective 
megacorporations.  After many problems in the negotiations, an 
agreement was finally reached in 1145.  Under the provisions, 
Dushgin & Delgado Corp was born.  Dushgin & Delgado busied itself 
with trade(interstellar/insystem/surface), maintenance of the 
fleet, and production of surface cargo transports.<P>

By 1169 Dushgin & Delgado controlled much of the surface merchant 
traffic on Vras and all of the Interstellar trade.   Vras was 
creeping back towards a prestellar technology level.  Dushgin & 
Delgado had trade with TED�s on both Fuetz and Schall and 
operated a slight amount surface merchant traffic on both of 
those worlds.<P>

As repair parts dwindled, Dushgin & Delgado lost the use of its 
two J-1 Scout/Couriers:  the management was not willing to risk 
the crew without the ability to verify the safety of the 
J-Drives.   These ships were added to the in-system fleet that 
serviced the three remaining J-1 vessels.<P>

In 1189, Plans were drawn up to redesign Dushgin�s moon into a 
complete starship yard.  The shipyard would build 50-200 ton 
ships, specializing in Traders and Couriers.<P>

In late 1190, Dushgin & Delgado experienced another setback, one 
of the three remaining Free Traders misjumped.  The crew was 
thrown many parsecs away and were it not for the skill of the 
engineer and astrogator, the ship & crew would have been lost.  
The crew was able to install a recovered J-2 drive into the ship, 
and, by removing some of the cargo to make room for fuel, the 
crew and ship returned safely .  When the crew finally made it 
back to Vras in early 1191, they were given a hero�s welcome and 
given the rest of the year off with pay.  Dushgin & Delgado Corp, 
however, wasted no time using this new Drive to make a profit.  
Trade was soon established with Vezinan TEDs, and Dushgin & 
Delgado Corp established a small amount of surface trade on 
Vezina.<P>

Later in 1191, when the Hivers first arrived in the Vras system, 
they were met by the Dushgin & Delgado Corp donated in system 
Navy.  Dushgin & Delgado Officials were in on the initial 
discussions with the Hiver, and sent many upcoming young students 
and employees to the Hiver tech schools in 1192.  Dushgin & 
Delgado officials were instrumental in developing the trading 
missions  sent out by the Dawn League, and even provided 
crewmembers for some of the ships at their own expense.<P>

By 1202, Dushgin & Delgado runs the premier spacecraft facility 
on Aubaine; at the surface facility they design and build 
spacecraft, 10 to 100 tons, for civilians and governments.  The 
facility for building 100 to 200 ton starships on Dushgin�s moon 
was completed in late 1194 and launched it�s first starships 
(100 ton J-2 couriers for the RC Mail Service) in mid 1199.  
Dushgin & Delgado also runs a number of smaller facilities 
designed to build 10 to 50 ton surface transports.<P>

Dushgin & Delgado has many family ties to the Aubaine, Schall, 
Phoebus, and Vezina Councilmembers, and many of the 
Councilmembers hold seats on the parchment board (see below) of 
Dushgin & Delgado.  The company�s involvement with the respective 
world governments existed even before the Hiver reconnected 
humans, so it was only natural that Dushgin & Delgado have a 
part in the formation of interstellar government.<P>

<A NAME="STRATEGY"><H3>CORPORATE STRATEGY</H3></A>

Dushgin & Delgado is an extremely enthusiastic expansionist 
company.  Most of the company�s policies are designed to make it 
easy for Dushgin & Delgado to enter new markets and broaden its 
base of income.  Dushgin & Delgado wants to be the cornerstone 
of  the RC expansion to take back the stars.  Dushgin & Delgado 
doesn�t approve of any illegal activities by Board member or 
corporate official, and any Board member or corporate official 
involved in illegal activities will be openly reprimanded and 
expelled.  However, if an activity will make a profit and not 
endanger the life of employees, Dushgin & Delgado will look the 
other way while an employee does the dirty work.  There are three 
things to remember about this profit making:
<OL>
<LI>If it will endanger the lives of Dushgin & Delgado employees 
not directly involved, IT WILL NOT BE TOLERATED.  If RC citizens 
are at risk, it better be a healthy profit.  (This means 
dangerous, harmful drugs ("Anagathics and Psi-drugs aren�t 
dangerous, they�re beneficial") and illegal weapons supplying 
are taboo, although the company does have a secret weapons 
supply to the rebels on Spencer and Oraflamme, but that activity 
is politically motivated.)
<LI>If the employee(s) involved is caught, Dushgin & Delgado Corp 
will respond as strongly against his actions as when an official 
or board member engages in the activity.
<LI>With Dushgin & Delgado having so many ties to the RC 
government structure, this is rarely a problem.  There are very 
few illegal activities that meet the criteria of #1 above.
</OL>

Dushgin & Delgado looks at its employees and profit in similar 
ways.  "They are the reason we are in business."
<OL><B>Employees:</B>
<LI>Without happy employees, you can�t be productive.  Without 
productivity, you cannot make a profit.
<LI>An employee that is being treated fairly will be a happy 
productive employee.  (Note:  This is somewhat contradictory to  
the way employees are treated if they are involved in illegal 
activities.)
</OL>

<OL><B>Profit:</B>
<LI>Without profit a business cannot exist.
<LI>Without profit, there is no reason to exist.
</OL>

Dushgin & Delgado is a strong proponent of the Federalist 
movement.  "When rulers hoard the technology, they are hampering 
trade and trade provides profit."

<A NAME="STRUCTURE"><H3>CORPORATE STRUCTURE</H3></A>

Dushgin & Delgado Corp is run by a board of twenty-five directors.  
Each director gets one vote in matters of corporate policies.  
Five of the positions (the Ruling Five) are lifetime and are held 
currently by members of the families that ran Dushgin & Delgado.  
When any one of these members dies, the other four choose his 
successor preferably from the family, but if no suitable family 
member is available, an outsider may be brought in.  To date, no 
outsiders have been brought in.  The remaining members (Council 
of Twenty) of the board serve five year terms and must be 
re-elected each five years.  They are re-elected (4 per year) by 
the rest of the board with the Ruling Five having one vote each 
and all other members not up for re-election having 1/8 vote each.  
If a member of the Council of Twenty dies before his term is up, 
another member is elected for a shortened term using the method 
described above.<P>

In addition to the board of directors, Dushgin & Delgado also has 
a board of advisors comprised of government and civilian leaders, 
as well as leaders of other corporations (no competitors and 
usually people Dushgin & Delgado wants to influence).  The board 
of advisors, also known as the Parchment Board, gets no vote in 
corporate policies.  The board of directors, however, respects 
the advise they get from the Parchment Board (they don�t 
necessarily follow it, but they respect it).  The members of 
this board are not paid directly; however, in addition to the 
annual meetings of this board, Dushgin & Delgado pays for each of 
the members to go on a one week vacation together with the board 
of directors.  Members of this board are chosen each year at the 
first board of directors meeting.  Inclusion to this board has 
been limited to 100 members, but has on occasion been stretched 
over the limit.  The vacation this board attends is seen as a 
status symbol on many RC worlds.<P>

The day to day operations of the company are run by the 
president and vice-presidents.  An organizational chart is 
available upon request.<P>

While the stockholders (or their heirs) are still listed as the 
company�s owners, the board of directors has all the rights 
associated with ownership.  Practically speaking, The Ruling 
Five are the owners of Dusgin & Delgado.<P>

<UL><B>Competition:</B>
<UL><I>Dushgin & Delgado Shipbuilding (55%):</I>
<LI>Dushgin & Delgado Shipbuilding has little in the way of 
competition.  Most of the other shipyards are so backlogged 
building larger ships for the RC Government that Dushgin & 
Delgado has carved itself a nice little niche in the Spacecraft 
and small starship market.  The small companies that are in 
direct competition with Dushgin & Delgado are usually not large 
enough to be much competition and usually handle the backlog 
from Dushgin & Delgado.  When a small shipyard does begin to 
threaten Dushgin & Delgado, they are usually driven out of 
business by Dushgin & Delgado�s aggressive price slashing.  
Dushgin & Delgado then gobbles up the facility, hires the 
employees back and resumes operations.  When the RC discontinues 
building larger ships with such furvor, Dushgin & Delgado expect 
the competition to increase, but they hope to have a solid niche 
carved into the market by then.<P>
</UL>
<UL><I>Dushgin & Delgado Trading(40%):</I>
<LI>Dushgin & Delgado Trading has carved itself a niche as the 
prime mail carrier for the RC.  There are very few other trading 
companies that provide any direct competition to Dushgin & 
Delgado.  
<A HREF="icis0000.html">Transstar</A> is the only company with 
enough power to compete with Dushgin & Delgado; however, in the 
booming economy of the Reformation Coalition, both companies have 
more than enough business to keep them busy.  Corporate rivalry 
exists more on a political level than a competitive level; 
however, the competitive rivalry is growing though.  Most of the 
other competition to Dushgin & Delgado comes from the Free Traders 
that make the RC a regular port of call.  The quantity of these 
traders is so small, that Dushgin & Delgado actually makes money 
on their visits to most worlds.  The goods delivered by the 
traders are offloaded at the starport and moved by Dushgin & 
Delgado surface transports.  Dushgin & Delgado has a marginal 
surface fleet/insystem fleet on most of the worlds of the RC and 
these transfers of materials from free traders at the starport to 
its final destination is highly profitable for Dushgin & Delgado.  
By the same token, the surface and insystem transfers that other 
companies handle are usually transfers of Dushgin & Delgado 
shipped goods.  Either way Dushgin & Delgado makes money on most 
everything shipped in the RC whether interstellar or insystem or 
surface.  (Note:  Dushgin & Delgado rents large garages at most 
planets auction facilities and most of the items bought at 
auction are moved by Dushgin & Delgado transports).<P>
</UL>
<UL><I>Diversification(5%):</I>
<LI>Dushgin & Delgado has begun to diversify into other 
industries.  Primarily, Dushgin & Delgado is moving into banking, 
entertainment, and pharmaceuticals.  Dushgin & Delgado�s 
interests are small, but growth in each industry is steady.<P>

<A NAME="ADVENTURE"><H3>ADVENTURE HOOKS</H3></A>

<DL>
<DT>Hostage
<DD> A member of the Board of Directors has been kidnapped by 
Guild/terrorist/or other criminal group.  They threaten to kill 
the member if not paid a ransom. Dushgin & Delgado needs a 
reliable group of Freelancers to rescue her.<P>

<DT>Rescue
<DD>A Dushgin & Delgado ship exploring new trade opportunities in 
the Wilds is overdue and persumed lost.  Dushgin & Delgado 
requires a Freelancer group to find out why the ship dissapered, 
and if possible punish those responsible.  It could be the 
standard Virus/TED/Guild villian or the ship may have simply 
broken down and needs the players to get spare parts for it.  
Or it may have misjumped and no trace of it will ever be found.<P>

<DT>Investigation
<DD>A dedicated reporter believes that the Dushgin & Delgaso 
Board of Directors is providing funding for Human Supremist 
terrorists that have been attacking Schalli.  She wants the 
players to help her break into the corporate headquarters on 
Aubaine, find evidence supporting her claim, and expose 
Dushgin & Delgado.<P>

<DT>Annoying Passanger
<DD>A member of the Board of Directors needs reliable 
transportation to a nearby planet, to close a deal. The next 
ship won't leave for another week, and that isn't soon 
enough.  The Director would annoy the crew with his questions 
about everything.  But if the crew deals with the Director 
politely and they manage to impress him/her they might walk away 
with an subcontract to carry freight for Dushgin & Delgado, which 
could lead to all sorts of other adventures.<P>

<DT>Corporate Rival
<DD>A rival corporation has been resisting Dushgin & Delgado's 
attempts to take over its territory. A new corporate executive 
dealt with this by hiring thugs to kill the head of the rival 
corporation. This worked fairly well, in fact so well that the 
local authorities investigated. The executive fled the area, but 
the local media has gotten a hold of the story and Dushgin & 
Delgado's name has been besmirched, the Board of Directors wants 
the executive found and brought to justice. This will show that 
Dushgin & Delgado doesn't support his actions. <P>

<DT>Stolen Merchandise
<DD>The PCs are hired to be guards for a valuable shipment and 
while they are guarding the merchandise, it is stolen.  The PCs 
are threatened with breach of contract (or something similar) if 
they do not recover the merchandise.<P>

<DT>Rebel
<DD>The PCs either stumble onto or are introduced to Dushgin & 
Delgado�s secret supply line to the rebels on Spencer and 
Oraflamme.  They may be hired to help, or they may have already 
been hired to uncover the supply line.  When they inform their 
superiors (if they inform) they will have trouble getting action 
done because of the relationship between the RC government and 
the Dushgin & Delgado leaders.   (Note: The more vehemently the 
PCs fight Dushgin & Delgado, the more vehemently Dushgin & 
Delgado will fight to silence the players.  D&D will not lose 
this one.)<P>
