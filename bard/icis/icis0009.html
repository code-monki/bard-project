<B>History:</B>
    Founded soon  after the recovery of the RMS Mackenzie from Lefiguerra / Khulam,  & stealing the Kidan invaders starship in
a quid-pro-quo deal with  Her Grace, Duchess Bonatiates, ending the war between herself and the two most powerful TEDs backed
by the Kidan "Diasporan Star Empire". Began as a merger of the crews & Captains of the starships RCS Osprey(ex-Rhyvik-a
Trenchant class Patrol Cruiser), RCS Green Hornet (Gazelle CE, no drop tanks), and RCS Tryffyd-Slayer (a modified 150dtn
Ranger-class Scoutship) & the business consortium of Majestic Survey & Relic Recovery, VIP  of "Special Operations" Midori
Chouinard (a post she still holds today in the new company), and the  RMS MacKenzie.
 <P>   The crews of JJFIS&M have to their credit also the recovery of the DLS Eos from Keipes/Aubaine (by diplomatic means); the
DLS Brilliant from Asena/Promise by force of arms; the cold recovery of 4x 400dtn SDBs from Lote & 2x  400dtn SDBs from
Nova Rhyll/Thoezennt (1201-1202); and finders fees on 3x relic Starhauler class freighters (Transstar owned now) from Lote's
wrecked orbital B-class station. With the Battle Angels Starmercs Company they helped liberate & unite the planet of Nova
Rhyll/Thoezennt in a six month-long campaign on the planet. They have spearheaded recontacting worlds to rimward of the
Coalition in Lazzerton & Mackenzie/Alpha Leonis as well for trade and future recognition by the RCSA, as well as being the
first RC-sponsored salvage team to penetrate the Vampire haunted ruins of Drydock/Auva, a former Solomani Naval Depot base in
Precollapse times, and bring back much needed Jump-drive manufacturing equipment, now slated for Trybec's Dawn SY, &
Oriflamme's Bourgund SY.<P>
    Members of the ships are half retirees, and half reservists in the RCN, and RCES. A handful are former Free Traders. As a
corporation, they have friends on both sides of the Centrist-Federalist issue in politics, though most of these are Federalist. Recent
evens on Oriflamme's upgrading to A-class Yards being approved have led to closer ties to Bourgund SY, and certain Technarches
involved thereof.  <P>
    One former board member and founding "father", CPT Sean "Lucky-Dice" Egan is now junior Assemblyman of Aubaine in the
RC Assembly, after marrying another founder, Ms Winona "Bee-Witched" Yukowa. MrEgan has resigned from the BOD, but still
hold their shares in the company.  Members of the company participated in the actions on Promise, including Oriflamme hero,
CDR Saffron "Old-Ghost" Ghulz.<P>
    One of the first Corporations to utilize the AVV weapon "Snake" in field /battle testing conditions. Licensed by RCSA for use
thereof, 21-I-1203.

Chairwoman CPT Winona Yukowa-Egan(ret); VIP Special Operations Midori Chouinard; VIP of Transportation/Shipping CPT Janvis

 <P>
<B>Employee-hiring strategy:</B>
    JJFIS&M prefers to hire locally rather than import labor (save in the cases of the Resource worlds of Peirsma, Svarla,
Savanjanni, Seliga & Conner), using locally available tech whenever possible as much as possible, save for critical equipment
(ie, Life support PLSS). Skills in Hostile environmental/Vacc suit are a plus, as well as those with combat experience with use in
firearms & explosives (as some salvage worlds have hostile virus infected machinery, or worse, Guild sponsored raiders).
Mechanics, Grav tech/Fusion reactor engineers, computer technicians, and medical personnel are all necessary to a successful
bootstrapping or salvage world operation. where equipment exceeds 1200dtns in size/ weight, Transstar, LCC is usually contracted
to move the item(s) in question, usually by the TSS Kether Friedmann Dawn-class Clipper. Pay is based on Skill level of
experience/ week. Skill 1 = 500cr/ week.; Supervisors/Medical techs 1000cr/ week per skill level. There are incentives in the form
of 5% finders fees from resale of salvaged item at Auction; and shares of stock in form of pension towards retirement.
