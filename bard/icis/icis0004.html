<HR><p>
 The Zaldus family has long been established on Vras.  They gained
vast amounts of prosperous undersea mining territory from the Archduke of Sol
after the Solomani Rim War.  Consequently, they grew enormously wealthy and
wisely hoarded much.  Due to the percieved threat of the Solomani
Confederation, as well as "Trade War" concerns and SolSec infiltration, the
Zaldus Family hoarded stockpiles of high technology in various hidden
warehouses, most aquatic.<p>

   The Zaldus family was instrumental in the arrest and suppression of Dr
Sarah Covington and her theories on the "Schalli."  To his credit, The chief
Zaldus at the time, Eric, helped a large scale movement away from his mining
territories and attempted various measure that would lessen impact on Schalli
society and lifestyle.<p>

    With the Final War, large numbers of refugees appeared and then came the
collapse.  Technology failed and the Zaldus mining concerns helped alleviate
much of the impact.  Most of the cached technology was kept hidden for fear of
the safety of the aquatic storehouses and a lashback of public opinion, as
well as a mob rush or govt seizure.<p>

    Due to Schalli concerns, well over half of the Zaldus family mines were
closed or diverted to Schalli ownership.  <A HREF="../dani/dani????.html">Eris Zaldus</a>
 decided he would not
oppose it, though he was deeply resentful.  He (wisely, as posterity would
judge) decided he would hold his stockpile of High Tech goods in their
storehouses (the surviving ones being submerged in the vaults of the Zaldus
family island mansion), unknown to all outside the inner circle of the Family.<p>

     When the Hivers came in 1192 and established the Hiver Technical Academy,
he still kept silent.  This time, he was calculating.  He knew now there would
be an imminent renessaince, but not how it would play out exactly and was
unwilling to play his wild card.  On his deathbed in 1197, he told his son to
wait until "the time was right."<p>

     1197 brought the Dawn League and Enrico Zaldus was eager with the
enthusiasm sweeping the League.  He heeded the advice of his late father and
decided not to reveal the caches of technology that the Zaldus family held.
<p>
      He instead scalped much of his families remaining assets.  He felt he
had to help somehow, but his father's death was too recent.  He sold almost
all of the remaining sea mines to the new KeeEEka Strongwall Schalli shipyard.
He used the proceeds to help fund the DLS Aurora.  
 <p>
      Following the loss of the <A HREF="../hana/hana8000.html">12 Traders</a> and the Auroras confimed
destruction at Vezina, he despaired. He vowed he'd never be hled captive by
unrealistic optimism and false hope. He could only trust the credit and knew
economics and mourned the loss of much of his family's ancestral mining
territory and property.  
  <p>
    The rage that came reformed the Dawn League into the Reformation
Coalition and the need for high technology that would back the economy of the
expansionist confederation convinced Enrico that the time was right for a
partial release of some high technology.  He revealed the existance of two of
the high technology vaults to the public knowledge.  The vaults were promptly
seized by the Assembly, but he was given the standard 50% auction fee.  He
timed the release (and the contents of the two vaults) with great demand,
primarily from Baldur (there was a good amount of TL11 power grid equipment).
This amounted to a fortune which put the Zaldus family back on the power
scene.  
 <p>
     The proceeds enabled Enrico to expand his holdings and created the
Zaldus Corporation in 1201.  His interests are focussed on high technology and
interstellar concerns.  Shipping, mail, freight & cargo have been seized and
the Zaldus Corporation is growing a mercantile star fleet to expand their
services to encompass the entirety of Coalition Space.  He has invested
heavily in banking and has three heavy high tech industries companies that
serve as subcontractors to the Reformation Coalition Exploration Service, the
Reformation Coalition Navy, and to
