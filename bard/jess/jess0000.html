 <B>College of Ancient Knowledge</B> (Lucifer)<BR>
 Founded in 1164, the Sacred College of Ancient Knowledge was establishedby the Way of the Ancient, a small cult on Lucifer that gained much power andvisibility since Lucifer has begun to reach to the stars again.

 The College's aim is to teach both technology and history, so thatstudents may retrace the steps of the Ancients. Despite the mystic rhetoric,the teachers are excellent and extremely dedicated. Many graduate end up on starships, doing Coalition workand keeping their eyes open for a possible Ancient artifact.<br>
