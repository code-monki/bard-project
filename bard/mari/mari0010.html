<h3>Synopsis</h3>
The characters are Coalition trouble-shooters, called in by a bootstrap team
working on a frontier world to aid in the investigation of some mysterious
assassinations of leading government figures, which are threatening the
stability of the Coalition supported faction on the world. Timing is not
important, and in fact, the adventure could fairly easily be converted to a
Regency contact team setting. The setting has been left deliberately vague to
allow transplantation into a variety of campaigns, but the world should be
balkanised and of low technology (TL4-5)

<h3>Briefing</h3>

The initial mission briefing takes place on the tiny makeshift space station of
150 displacement tons which has been left orbiting the world. Although fairly
new, the construction of many of the station's fittings appears cheap, from the
exposed piping on the exterior, to the flimsy blue plastic of the tables in the
galley and the slightly unpleasant chill of a poorly calibrated air
conditioner. The station has a permanent crew of twenty, although it has
sufficient capacity for double this number. A single missile turret provides
token defence for the station, but a greater insurance of safety is in the lack
of plunderable resources to attract pirates to the world.
The mission briefing takes place in the small command room of the station, on
arrival the characters are escorted there quickly from the docking ring. On
monitors around the room are several images of the world, spinning slowly but
visibly beneath the station. Other smaller monitors around the edges of the
larger screens show weather patterns being tracked and the status of the
handful of satellites that make up a rudimentary communications system for the
operatives on the ground.
The station commander is fairly young, and the dress uniform he wears for the
briefing suggests some anxiety about reports the players may make to his
superiors.<P>
'I'll try to be brief, the situation on the ground is fragile and your presence
is needed urgently. Most of the information you need can be acquired
planetside, so I'll just give you an overview while my flight crew prepare the
interface shuttle, okay?'  He gestures to on of the wall displays which updates
to show a spinning image of the mainworld, as you watch, the major continent is
highlighted in red. 'Our mission here is as a liaison to the largest faction on
the planet, The Federation of  Tomorrow, a comparatively progressive democracy
which commands popular support, there are many other smaller factions also on
the planet (the map highlights a patchwork of different coloured areas around
the edges of the central red area) and following our contact with the
Federation, many of them formed a loose alliance due to fears of offworld
domination. The Federation is governed by ten representatives, one elected from
each of the provinces, which form a council in the nation's capital. Three
weeks ago, the head of the council was assassinated, and since then two more
members of the council have been killed. We believe that the assassinations
have been carried out by one of the rival powers on the planet, but the local
security forces insist that the killings were carried out by a ghost, some kind
of local superstition. We don't have the resources here to investigate this
matter, so we have been waiting for the Coalition to send specialists to assist
us. It is imperative that you get to the bottom of this as our helplessness has
encouraged dissenting factions that would like to see us leave the planet
completely.'  As he finishes a woman in a slightly scrumpled flight suit enters
the room. She salutes with a sharpness that seems strangely out of place with
her appearance.
<P>
'Yes Lieutenant?' the captain inquires.
<P>
'The pre-flight checks on the lander are complete, sir. There's still that
problem on the number two thruster, but the contra grav has just been refitted,
so I don't think there's much danger of leaving the capital with another crater
nearby', she then addresses the characters 'If you'd like to follow me, then.'
She salutes again, then turns ands leaves at a brisk walk. (Any characters with
Ship's Engineering can inspect the interface shuttle before entrusting their
life to it, should they wish. Most likely they will agree with the pilot's
assessment that the risk is minimal, although on a fumble they may remain
convinced that there is significant danger. In this case, if the character
persuades the others to wait for repair the station captain will try to
persuade them to go regardless, however, if they still remain on the station
there will be another assassination a few hours before they realise that the
shuttle is in better condition than it looks. This should have no effect on the
progress of the plot, but should leave a mark on the player's consciences)

<h3>Planetfall</h3>

Despite a strange grating noise as the thrusters fire to slow the lander before
touchdown, the landing from the station is uneventful. The pilot brings the
ship to rest in a large sandy bottomed crater, possibly 500 meters in diameter.
In the distance the green countryside is broken by a darker area, the capital
city still being too distant to resolve any detail with the naked eye.
As the characters leave the interface shuttle they will notice that in the
centre of the crater the sand has been fused together into a glassy surface,
presumably by the heat of repeated landings. It is Easy:Acrobatics or Agility
to avoid falling over, on failure the character falls and cuts their hand on a
shard of glass broken from the surface by the pressure of the landing gear
(1D6/2 damage to an arm).<P>
The pilot leads the players up the side of the crater, talking between breaths
'They don't like us to come in to land too close to the city, nothing personal,
they just had a few bad experiences with stuff falling out of the sky a while
back. The crater makes quite a good landing site, keeps us out of the wind on
the final part of the descent, and the surface is quite solid now that we've
blasted it a few times with the HEPlaR to keep the sand down. We think that
this crater was the result of a small nuke from the Final War, perhaps it
missed the city, perhaps it just got left in an unstable orbit after a fleet
engagement up there (she looks up at the sky, turning a golden yellow as the
sun sinks towards the horizon), and this where it came down. Maybe they were
shooting at something on the ground, who knows? The radiation has mostly
decayed now, but I'm not saying I'd want to build a house here.' As the
characters climb over the lip of the crater they are confronted by the sight of
a small building next to some railway tracks. Little more than a shed, the
structure still has a neatly painted sign on it which reads 'Starport'.
'They built it for us. Well, the tracks ran nearby anyway, and they wanted to
do something to show us they appreciate us being here. Don't worry about those
cracks in the structure, we had a small earthquake a few months ago, but most
of the damage was superficial. A train should be along soon that will take you
into the city, just wait here and get on, you won't need a ticket. Me, I've got
to get back to the station and work on the shuttle, we'll need _all_ the
engines working if we need to evacuate suddenly. Look, I hope you get to the
bottom of this, it's strange, but I've kind of got used to this place and I
wouldn't want to get reassigned.' With this last word she begins back down the
slope into the crater. A few minutes later the shuttle lifts off, the thrusters
giving off a heat which is only just bearable, like standing slightly too close
to a fire.<P>
After a wait of ten minutes on a bench in the unmanned station building a steam
train arrives at the platform and slowly screeches to a halt. The driver
invites the characters to ride with him in the engine, or alternatively seats
in the carriages can be taken. The journey to the city takes twenty minutes and
is uneventful.
<P>
The characters are met at the station by state security officers, who wear deep
blue uniforms and carry revolvers as sidearms. They look relieved to see the
characters, and explain that they would be grateful if the party would inspect
the security arrangements around the home of the acting head of state (his two
predecessors having been assassinated too recently for the government to affirm
his succession). The security officers drive the players to a large house on
the edge of town.

<h3>Shutting up for the night</h3>

The house has three stories and is surrounded on all sides by ten metres of
lawn. A few patches of bare earth show where bushes and other cover have been
recently uprooted. A ten foot high brick wall topped with razor wire surrounds
the building. The party is greeted at the gate by a senior security officer who
greets them warmly before addressing them with respect to the situation:
'As you can see, we've tightened up security around the house since this
started happening, but of course you'll want to see that for yourself. We have
done everything possible, it would be enough to stop any man but I still reckon
it won't be enough to deal with what we're facing here, a ghost, a curse, call
it what you will, it's something more than we can understand.'
He than leads the party off to inspect the premises. The following details can
be related as requested:<P>
-The Head of State sleeps in a bedroom on the third floor. There are no
drainpipes or similar aids to climbing the wall, which is smooth stone. A pair
of guards are stationed at the bottom of the wall, underneath the window.<P>
-The other entrance to the bedroom is from the top floor hallway. There are a
further two guards watching the bedroom.<P>
-During the day the premier is accompanied by two bodyguards. The security
during the day seems to be far less tight than that at night. As the other
killings were at night, and as the security men genuinely believe that they are
dealing with the supernatural, they expect the greatest danger to come in the
dark.<P>
- Four security guards surround the house, one watching each side, and a
further four patrol round the outside of the house's walls.
<P>
The players should be able to suggest some security improvements eg. better
lighting, more guards, patrol route alterations, even some kind of decoy in the
main bedroom. Despite all this however, the events of the night are largely
unavoidable...
<P>
The party are likely to be tired and will be offered accommodation in the house
for the night. Some players may alternatively wish to help with the night
watch, this poses few problems unless the characters involved have very high
observation assets and advanced sensor equipment or cyberware. Even if they do
choose to stay up, fatigue, and the assassin's unusual ability to detect
cyberware and avoid those who carry it should ensure that the players will have
little chance of having any effect on the night's events, as they are extremely
unlikely to have any idea of what they are facing.

<h3>Another assassination</h3>

A few hours after sunrise, after a quiet night without any disturbances, the
characters will be woken by a scream coming from a bedroom on the top floor of
the house. Characters rushing to find out what has happened will find a shocked
maid standing over a dropped tray of breakfast inside the door of the
President's room. The President lies in bed, but a large red stain spreading
across the sheets indicates that despite all the precautions taken, the
assassin has struck again. Yet the guards stationed at the only two entrances
to the room saw nothing all night.

<h3>Post Mortem</h3>
The five wounds to the President are of an unusual nature. On first inspection
(Average:Medical or Average:Education for characters with military experience)
the wounds are consistent with large calibre gunshot wounds. However, despite
showing none of the burning typical of laser or high energy weapons, the wounds
have no physical bullets inside (Average:Medical for a character to determine
this, or if there is no medic in the party then a doctor will arrive within a
hour). The wound depth is also unusually shallow considering the probable size
of the round, although the wounds are certainly deep enough to be fatal. Closer
inspection of the wounds (Difficult:Medical) will reveal an unusual degree of
bacterial infection of the wounds (this would be missed by a visiting doctor).
The staff of the house need no convincing that the murder is supernatural, the
silence, the apparent invisibility of the assassin and the missing bullets all
convincing them beyond doubt, as well as creating some doubts in the minds of
the party as to whether they are facing an enemy agent or a ghost. The
household are all in shock and seem far less welcoming to the characters than
they had the day before, they are all talking to each other about the 'hundred
year curse' in whispers.
<P>
There are several important pieces of evidence around the house. For each clue,
relevant skills are listed, along with task difficulties which are dependent on
the declared area of search. In addition to this, successful Investigation
rolls could help uncover clues which have been missed.
<P>
Bedroom - Difficult:Observation<P>
Bedroom window - Average:Observation
In the corner of the window of the bedroom there is a small hole in the glass.
A circle about three centimetres across has been cut cleanly from the glass.
Partially covered by a curtain, the hole is hard to see.<P>
Formidable:Observation
- Glass dust on the inside of the window shows that it was cut from outside.
<P>
Average:Observation
The direction of the gunshot wounds on the victim indicates that they were shot
from the general direction of the closed window. Careful measurement and
calculation (Difficult:Investigation) could link the wounds to the hole in the
window.
<P>
Garden - Formidable:Observation
The razor wire across the top of the wall has been very slightly flattened in
one section. There is no sign of any blood or cloth on the wire.
<P>
Garden - Formidable:Observation
Leading across one patch of bare earth are a set of particularly distinct
footprints. The footprints indicate a normal size foot, but the depth of the
footprints is about five centimetres compared to the footprints left by the
characters which are at most two or three centimetres deep. The trail
disappears once the firmer turf at the edge of the flower bed is reached.
<P>
Local Bars - Difficult:Streetwise
Players may wish to investigate the possibility of an enemy agent being behind
the killings. Talking to people in bars does reveal a degree of xenophobia with
respect to foreigners, but this does not help the players track anybody down,
since in the eyes of the locals, anyone with an accent is suspicious.
<P>
Local Library - Average:Research
Looking through the history archives will reveal one particularly significant
event in relation to the events of the recent weeks. There is a record of a
similar spate of killings of senior government officials almost one hundred
years ago, shortly after fighting in the Final War reached the area. The nature
of the injuries recorded in the press clippings matches very closely with what
has been observed here. The killer was never apprehended and since then has
acquired a semi-mythical status, in the same way as the Terran serial killer
'Jack the Ripper'. During the Final war, the planet was not involved in the
fighting in any significant way, lacking any starport, although considerable
fleet traffic passed through the system, using it as a refuelling stop. The
investigation into the murders was curtailed by a small nuclear explosion near
to the city, which caused considerable damage and confusion.

<h3>Referee's Information</h3>

So what exactly is going on? The cause of these events can be traced back to
1116. During the Final War a small robotics company developed a variety of
assassin robots, for sale to any faction willing to put up the credits. As part
of the testing and evaluation of the robots a small military vessel was used to
deliver prototype units to worlds which were for whatever reason insulated from
the interstellar community. On these worlds the company could carry out
'testing' without danger of repercussions from any faction. On this world
however, after the test had been completed, as the courier made ready to depart
it was detected by a cruiser passing through the system. Refusing to
acknowledge the cruiser's communications and operating without a transponder,
the courier was assumed to be an enemy vessel and the cruiser fired on it from
orbit. The missile used was not intended for atmospheric operations and in the
terminal phase of its flight towards the courier, high winds caused the flight
computer to lock up as it tried to correct for every gust. The missile impacted
a few hundred meters from the courier, causing it little damage, but flipping
it onto its side, and burying it under several meters of the material that was
thrown up from the explosion. The efforts of the crew to free themselves were
futile, the airlock was buried, and the det-laser missiles carried by the
courier offered no way to cut themselves free. The crew put themselves into the
emergency low berths to wait for the rescue party from the company. Meanwhile
the company headquarters, containing all records of the mission, had been
destroyed in fighting, and so the rescue party never came.
More recently, an earthquake uncovered the airlock, which now lies at the
bottom of a three-meter deep crack in the ground in the middle of a small
forest. The <A href="../vera/vera5019.html">A(P)-11 robot</A> had remained on standby for years, powered by a
trickle of electricity from the fusion plant. When the earthquake hit the
tremor shook a loose power connection to the robot, temporarily disconnecting
the electricity which the robot was using to preserve its internal settings.
This resulted in the robot resetting itself. It now believes that the original
'testing' never took place, and a month before the players arrived, it resumed
its original programming.<P>
Programmed with exceptional stealth abilities, and with sensors and electronics
subsystems which aid in avoiding detection, the robot is almost invisible when
involved in a planned execution. It is only when it is forced to improvise that
there is any possibility of detection. Unfortunately, the patrols which were
organised to protect the president were nothing unconventional, so the robot
had little trouble in using its grapple to climb undetected up to the roof,
matching the texture of the wall, and then lowering itself down to the
president's window where it used a silenced weapon for the assassination.

<h3>He doesn't know his own strength</h3>

During the players' investigations they will be approached by a flustered
looking doctor, accompanied by two security guards. The doctor talks rapidly,
turning slightly red as he does so:
'I'm very sorry to interrupt you, I'm sure you have other things to attend to,
but I wonder if I could possibly request your assistance, just for a few hours,
I wouldn't ask, only, well, there has been something of an incident at a local
school. I've never seen anything like it, but perhaps you may know this
situation better. This really is a matter of urgency, please come with us to
the hospital.' He pauses to catch breath, before launching into another
monologue 'But of course, you don't know what has happened. Well, it seems that
one of the older boys at a local school has somehow got hold of one of your
weapons, or something like it, and has shot one of the younger pupils. He
really is in a very bad way and I fear we can do little more for him, worse
yet, this other boy has run off, and nobody knows who he is. This boy is the
only witness and we need your help to save him.'
[What has happened here is not the fault of the players or any of the station
staff. The weapon, an old laser carbine, was found by the older boy, Hoyt Adaki
inside the old courier, which he discovered while hiding in the woods to skip
school. Sadly Hoyt is a sadistic and violent individual, and when a younger
child at school annoyed him, he shot him]
The players may choose not to involve themselves in this, especially if they
feel that their lack of medical experience would make them more of a nuisance
than an advisor. This doesn't matter as there will be opportunity to follow
this lead later.
<h3>At the hospital</h3>

As the party enters the room containing Hoyt's victim, Ulex Grey, they can
smell a charred odour. The boy is apparently only eleven or twelve, and all
present will immediately notice that he has a red line burnt across his cheek,
which Average:Education or Medical can identify as a laser wound. When the
players arrive he is unconscious, and the nurses present will tell the players
he has been that way since he arrived in hospital. An Average:Medical
(Diagnosis) roll will indicate that the laser wounds to his torso have damaged
his heart, and although cauterisation from the heat has prevented much of the
bleeding, his pulse is becoming rapidly more erratic, and will likely suffer
heart failure within a few hours. Failure on the diagnosis will provide the
information above, but will make all medical tasks one level harder.
Catastrophic failure in diagnosis will suggest that the damage is less severe
than it actually is. This makes all further tasks two levels harder, and the
players may wrongly decide to leave the child alone. There are two major
options for treatment
<P>
- The child could be treated in the hospital. The operation is
Difficult:Medical (Surgery) due to the primitive equipment available. On
success, the child regains consciousness for a few hours before slipping back
into a terminal coma. This time will allow gentle questioning, revealing the
identity of his attacker. On Critical Success the child will eventually make a
full recovery, making the characters involved into minor local heroes. Failure
indicates that nothing the characters try to save him is successful.<P>
- The medbay on the space station is better equipped to deal with these
injuries. It will take 1D6 hours for the lander to arrive after it has been
requested, and then a further hour to return to the station. Keeping Ulex alive
until he can be taken to the station is determined by the success of an
Average:Medical (Trauma Aid) task. Success gives him 1D6+1 hours to live.
Critical success gives him 1D6+5 hours to live and failure (or catastrophic
failure) 1D6-2. Once he reaches the medbay, the surgery task becomes
Average:Medical (surgery), with effects of success as above.
<P>
If the players are successful in obtaining the name of his attacker, then they
can cross-reference it with school records to find the boy's home address. If
they do this quickly (only possible if they operated in the hospital), then
they could intercept Hoyt before his amateur bank robbery. In this case it may
be easier to apprehend him and with less danger to civilians than at the scene
of the robbery. If the players choose this option, then I leave it up to you to
determine the course of events, bearing in mind that ideally the players should
subdue Hoyt without injury.

<h3>The Robbery</h3>

While the party is passing through one of the commercial districts of the city,
they will be blocked on one street by a security cordon across the road. A
dozen national security men are crouched behind trees and bushes opposite a
bank. On the steps leading up to the bank doors a security officer lies holding
his chest, obviously in considerable pain. Inside Hoyt is holding six terrified
bank workers hostage. Although hopelessly amateur in his execution of the
robbery, Hoyt's paranoia has made it too risky for security to try anything,
one man who tried to enter the building was shot down as he tried to climb the
stairs.
<P>
Hoyt, Experienced NPC, Assets:Melee (Unarmed), Laser pistol 6, Observation 6.
Armed with a TL-13 CLC laser carbine (4 rounds remaining)
<P>
In this situation the players have several objectives:<BR>
1. To free the hostages<br>
2. To try to rescue the man on the steps. (This must be done very quickly, and
the man must be operated on in a local hospital, Formidable:Medical (Surgery)
to save him)<br>
3. To capture Hoyt alive, to find out where he acquired the weapon.<br>
<P>
The hostages are being held in the foyer of the bank, and can be seen through
the windows. Hoyt is staying away from the windows, and reflections make it
hard to see where he is, although NAS or similar high tech sensors could detect
him. He is standing in a position where he can see the front steps, but little
beyond that.
<P>
The party does have several things which will help them apprehend him.<br>
- He doesn't know that the ammunition in the carbine is limited.<br>
- The bank has a back entrance which could be used to mount a surprise attack,
unfortunately, only the bank manager has the keys and he is one of the
hostages. It is a difficult:Intrusion task to break in, and either a
distraction or a difficult:Stealth roll will also be necessary to hide the
noise.<br>
- One of the bankers was eating out at a restaurant and has just returned. He
can provide the players with information about the layout of the bank.
<P>
Unless the players use obviously excessive force (fusion rifles, HE grenades
etc) Hoyt will be captured and it will be possible to interrogate him, and find
out the location of the buried starship.
<P>
<h3>Digging up the Past</h3>
The party can take the train back to the Starport station. On arrival, they can
see the forest described by Hoyt begins about a hundred meters from the edge of
the crater.
It takes about a hours of searching through the undergrowth, which seems to
consist entirely of a thorny scarlet creepers, to find the entrance to the
ship. The ground has cracked open leaving a gap which is a meter wide and about
five meters long. It slopes downwards at about a forty five degree angle, and
about four meters down, a smooth metallic surface can be seen. The airlock is
at one end of the fissure, half obstructed by the earth. The airlock is jammed
open, some rocks having fallen into the track which the airlock door slides on.
It is a tight fit to get through the airlock, but once inside, it is clear that
little dirt has fallen into the vessel.
<p>
The airlock opens onto the main living area of the ship. The interior feels
extremely claustrophobic. The lighting is provided by small low power emergency
lights in the ceiling, about half of the lights are broken, burnt out after
years of use. Although sufficient to see by, the lighting takes a while to
adjust to after the bright daylight outside, and the irregular arrangement
casts strange shadows across the walls.
A table fills most of the room and a couple of plastic cups lie on the floor,
as do the dried remains of a tall plant, its pot knocked onto its side,
spilling soil across the tight woven carpet. A narrow corridor leads towards
the front of the ship and the bridge, and a similar corridor leads backwards to
the hold and engineering sections.
Engine room. The engineering components of the ship are contained within a
single room, but blast screens divide up the compartment, and there are
emergency bulkheads which can close off damaged sections. There is a low
humming noise from the main reactor, which is operating on a trickle of fuel
from the jump tankage, the much smaller reactor fuel tanks having been drained
decades ago.<p>
Hold. The small hold contains a pair of emergency low berths. Each contains
four people. The display on the side of the freezers indicates that the crew
members inside are still alive, although the power plant will need to be
brought back up to a higher output to power the revival process. Also in the
hold is a tall cabinet with the impression of a heavily built humanoid. A
socket in the impression corresponds to the small of the back. Easy:Robotics
test to determine that this is a storage unit for a humanoid robot. Further
reinforced piping leads from the cabinet to an unmarked tank a few meters away.
The tank contains hydrocarbon distillates, the top can be opened to discover
this, however the mixture of fuel vapour and air at the top of the tank could
pose an explosive danger if there are any sources of ignition nearby.
The people in the low berths will probably pose a moral dilemma for the
players. By the time the characters will have been able to bring the power
plant and main computers on-line to revive them, they will almost certainly
have recovered log entries from the crew's personal quarters which will
describe the nature of the mission they were involved in. Should the players
revive them? They are murderers with a corporate morality which belongs in the
past, but at the same time their knowledge and skills could be put to great
use.<p>
Quarters. The corridor leading from the main living area forwards to the bridge
has doors to crew cabins on the left and the right. In most rooms a personal
hand computer can be located easily, which will describe the mission of the
courier and the events which lead to it being buried. In addition, the
engineer's hand computer contains performance and technical specifications of
the A(P)-11. The quarters are fairly tidy, a common feature of all being a lack
of any great number of personal effects, only one or two souvenirs, an unusual
shell in one, an ornately crafted pen in another, a painting of a sunset over a
city of lights in the captain's room.<p>
Bridge. The bridge is the area of the ship which shows the greatest damage. The
superdense shutters which slide over the front window during reentry and combat
have been left open, leaving the windows unprotected. The left panel has
cracked open, and a considerable quantity of earth and debris has fallen into
the bridge compartment. The control panel is half covered by soil and rock,
clearing it will take several hours. The small bridge would probably feel
claustrophobic even when cleared out, but at the moment there is barely room
for more than two people to fit.
<p>
While the players are exploring the ship, the A(P)-11 will observe them, unsure
at first as to whether they are crew members or enemies. It will take about
twenty minutes to decide that they are enemies, but this time depends greatly
on the method in which the players explore. If they are clearly taking
precautions, moving with guns drawn, etc. then the time will be reduced, if
they are less timid in their investigation then it will take longer to realise
what is happening. Once it decides to eliminate the characters it will not act
immediately. Instead it will wait until characters are alone before attacking.
The robot is extremely dangerous, so perhaps it would be advisable to allow the
party to bring an NPC security guard or similar with them, so that the first
person found dead is not a player character. An encounter with the robot should
be terrifying, shadows moving amongst the clutter of the ship are likely to be
the only warning before the character is shot by a large figure which will
appear as if from nowhere. Use player paranoia to create the atmosphere,
mention half seen movements among the reactor machinery, strange sounds,
'footsteps' which turn out to be a sound from a fuel pump.
<p>
There are three major possibilities for dealing with the robot:<br>
1. Heavy ordinance - Although the robot is heavily armoured, once a shot gets
under it's skin it is surprisingly fragile. One problem may be finding a weapon
which can damage the robot which is safe to use in confined spaces, but
carefully used fusion rifles or something exotic like EMP rifles should do the
trick. It may be possible to lure the robot outside, but because of its
sensors, it would be difficult to ambush it.<p>
2. Fuel supply - The engineer's log should provide some clues to another method
of dealing with the robot. The limited fuel supply is a major weakness,
although it will not be possible to trick the robot into going too far to have
enough fuel to get back, the only source on the planet of hydrocarbon
distillates of a high enough grade to fuel the robot is in the tank in the
courier. If this were destroyed then the robot would cease to be a threat after
a few hours. In fact, after the fuel is destroyed it is likely to shut itself
down immediately, as it has no sense of revenge, and tracking down the players
after the fuel is destroyed would change nothing. That is not to say that while
the players try to destroy the fuel it will not try to stop them. It will
require good demolitions skills, or inspired planning to find a sure way to
destroy the fuel. The robot will attack the party to hinder them, and is
capable of using fire fighting equipment if the players try to burn the fuel.<p>
3. Reprogramming - It could be possible to use the ship's computers to change
the robot's program. The security on the computer systems is fairly tight, it
would require a Difficult:Computer roll to break in to reprogram the A(P)-11.
On outstanding success the hacking is so fast that the robot doesn't have time
to respond, on normal success the party will have to defend the hacker from the
robot while he breaks into the system.
<p>
Once the mystery has been solved, and the assassin robot dealt with, the party
will be treated as honoured guests by the government. The salvage of an
uninfected and only superficially damaged starship will get underway (assuming
the players didn't blow it to pieces while hunting down the robot), and
preparations will be made back in the Coalition/Regency for the trial of a
group of remnant war criminals (assuming the players didn't pull the plug on
their low berths). The players will receive a finder's share in the courier
once it has been recovered, in addition to any standard wages.
