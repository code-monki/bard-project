<h3>Synopsis</h3>

The Reformation Coalition sends a rescue mission to Keipes to free the 
Dawn League prisoners.  Because the data priests, the true rulers of 
Keipes, are xenophobic, the RC has every reason to believe that the one or 
two ships at Keipes will be from Keipes' own space force.  Thus, they hope
to jump in, "guns blazing," knock out the sensors for the meson gun "deep 
site," drop the troops on top of the prison camp in the middle of a
desert, free their people, pick up everyone, and jump out, before Keipes 
has a chance of calling in any reinforcements.  <p>

Unfortunately, between the time the RCS Thunderchild departs the RCN HQ at 
Aurora and the time the Thunderchild jumps into Keipes' system, the data 
priests of Keipes undergo a change of leadership.  The new leader had 
already made secret arrangements to auction off the prisoners to whomever 
was interested.  Arturo I, Emperer of Kide, was one such interested person.  
So were a couple of traders from the Merchants' Guild of Diaspora.  <p>

So now, we have three semi-hostile forces warily watching each other, 
wondering if the other two will gang up on them, or if they can gang up 
with one to take advantage of the third.  Naturally, *this* is the moment 
that the Thunderchild breaks out of jumpspace, and proceeds with its 
attack...  <p>

<hr>

Background: 

In 1199, the Dawn League sent the DLS <i>Eos</i>, a <i>Bastien</i>-Class Liner, to 
Keipes (0132/Aubaine/Old Expanses, B677884-6) to explore the possibility 
of trade and diplomatic contact.  The crew of the <i>Eos</i> were taken prisoner, 
and the ship was seized.  <p>

In 1200, the DLS <i>Trigger</i> attempted to free the imprisoned crew of the 
DLS <i>Eos</i>.  Unknown to them, Keipes had a functional meson gun in a "deep 
site" emplacement.  The rescue mission was a failure. <p> 

Now, it's 1/VI/1202.  The Reformation Coalition Navy has a 50-ton Meson 
Screen Module for their Modular Clipper Ship.  They know where the 
prisoners are being held.  It's time to bring their people home... <p> 

<hr>

Brother Jarrod of the Order of Revealed Knowledge, Caretaker of the Most 
Holy Retreat of Solitude and Meditation, was a up-and-coming member of the 
order of "data priests" that truly ruled the planet Keipes.  In the 
fullness of time, he could have expected to succeed Most Reverend Brother 
Willem as the head of the Order.  Unfortunately for Brother Willem, 
Brother Jarrod didn't know the value of the virtue Patience.  <p>

Now, Most Reverend Brother Jarrod, with his head bowed with grief over the 
"peaceful passing in his sleep" of his predecessor, has opened contact 
with useful offworlders.  In exchange for the sullen and uncooperative 
prisoners, he wants these other offworlders to teach his data priests how 
to travel to the stars... <p>

<hr>

"The Emperer of Kide sends greetings to Our Esteemed Cousin, The Most 
Reverend Holy Brother of the Order of Revealed Knowledge.  It is Our most 
fervent wish that this missive find you in excellent health and of good 
cheer.  We have entrusted this messenger, Our most faithful vassal, to 
entreat you for the favor of the starship you liberated from the Star 
Vikings.  He speaks with Our voice in these negotiations.  We are prepared 
to be most generous in wealth of arms and munitions.  Ask, and it shall be 
yours..." <p> 

<hr>

The Merchants' Guild of Diaspora is always interested in opening new 
markets.  Teaching some backwoods shamans how to blow themselves up with a 
starship in exchange for some highly trained slaves is a deal too good to 
pass up.  And if the rubes should prove not to know how to properly guard 
their starships, well, now...  <p>

<hr>

The RCS <i>Thunderchild</i>, commanded by Commodore Sean "Hammer" Lathrop and 
Captain Pat "Who Me" Ritter, will make best possible speed from Hq RC 
Navy, Aurora (0535/Aubaine/Old Expanses) to confirmed deep-space location 
at 0133/Old Expanses to rendevous with two Oasis-Class Tankers (modified XBoat 
Tenders; already waiting at location). <p> 

<i>Thunderchild</i> will take on full load of fuel and prepare for jump to 
Keipes (0132/Aubaine/Old Expanses) for rescue mission.  Extreme precision 
should be used for calculating the jump vector into Keipes to optimize 
the attack.   <p> 

Due to expected/usual patrol routines of local defense craft, refueling 
once in-system is *not* advisable.  Thus, the need for tanker support one 
parsec away.  Jumping one parsec in and one parsec out will leave the 
<i>Thunderchild</i> with reasonably high amount of maneuvering fuel.  The 
optimal path of approach is a *direct* line to Tresek, Keipes's moon, and 
Keipes itself, keeping Tresek between <i>Thunderchild</i> and Keipes until the 
last possible minute.  This will hide <i>Thunderchild</i> from ground-based 
sensors on Keipes.  This will also make <i>Thunderchild</i> blind to any 
activity on Keipes.  This handicap is compensated for by the use of a 
listening post (see below).  <p> 

Currently in-system at Keipes is RMS <i>Knife's Edge</i> (Scout/Courier), 
landed at Keipes' moon, serving as a listening post.  <i>Thunderchild</i> will 
establish tight-beam-commo link with <i>Knife's Edge</i> as soon as feasible 
upon arriving in-system. <p>  

Included with this mission order is detailed information on: <br>
<LI> Location of Tanker Squadron at 0133/Old Expanses.  
<LI> Relative location of Keipes and Tresek (moon of Keipes).  
<LI> Location of RMS <i>Knife's Edge</i> on Tresek as well as commo-frequency and 
  protocols to be used.  
<LI> Location of ground-based sensor sites used by "deep site" meson gun.  
<LI> Location of Dawn League/RC prisoners.  

Good luck.

<h3>Special Conditions</h3>

<li> Because of the Scout/Courier on Tresek acting as an observation post, 
  the RC fleet cannot be surprised.  

<li> All of the ships that are landed at the starport are powered down.  
  Also, they have a +1 Diff. Lvl. penalty to man battle stations, if 
  surprised.  

<li> The RC knows the location of the three sensor sites used for the 
  "deep-site" meson gun.  

<li> The 18 Dawn League/RC prisoners are at the starport.  The RC player 
  will *not* discover this fact until *after* assaulting the previous 
  known location of the prisoners.  

<li> Any ship wanting to jump to another system must get at least 34 hexes 
  away from Keipes to be safe.  The minimum safe jump distance for Tresek 
  is 11 hexes, but as Tresek is 10 hexes away from Keipes, this is 
  actually immaterial to the fleeing ship.  

<ul>  (For those who care, here's the math): <br>

  <b>a)</b> 100 diameters x 10,287 km / 30,000 km/hex = 34.23 hexes, round to 34; <br>

  <b>b)</b> Tresek's diameter is 3,319 km; 100 diameters x 3,319 km / 30,000 
    km/hex = 11.06 hexes, round to 11; <br>

  <b>c)</b> Tresek occupies orbit # 60, which is 60 radii according to TNE; 
    60 radii is 30 diameters; 30 x 10,287 km / 30,000 km/hex = 10.287, 
    round to 10.  <br>
</ul>

<li> The drop troop assault will be resolved using the "Boarding" rules.  
<ul>
  <b>a)</b> The (former) prison has two sections and 20 (non-Marine) troops.  
    After seizing control of both sections, the RC will then "know" that 
    the prisoners are at the starport.  <br>

  <b>b)</b> The starport is broken into the following areas.  Each area has four 
    sections.  Keipes has 50 (non-Marine) troops and 200 (non-Marine, non-
    troop) personnel to distribute throughout these areas. <p> 

    * Admin/Support -- The prisoners are held here.  <br>
    * Landing Pad #1 -- The Liner is here.  <br>
    * LP #2 -- Keipes' Free Trader is here. <br> 
    * LP #3 -- (currently empty) <br>
    * LP #4 -- Kide's Patrol Cruiser is here. <br> 
    * LP #5 -- (currently empty) <br>
    * LP #6 -- The Guild Scout/Courier is here. <br> 
    * LP #7 -- The Guild Far Trader is here.  <br>
    * LP #8 -- (currently empty) <p>

    <b>i)</b> A player (or coalition of players) controlling at least two 
      sections of the Admin/Support area can remove 1D6 prisoners each 
      turn, moving them to a ship he controls.  <p>

    <b>ii)</b> A player (or coalition of players) must control at least two 
      sections of a Landing Pad before he can begin boarding a ship in 
      that area.  <p>

    <b>iii)</b> Each starship will have the usual number of sections (one per 
      ship, except for the Liner, which has two sections). <p> 

    <b>iv)</b> Forces can move from one area to an adjacent area and begin 
      "boarding" that area, all in one turn.  The eight Landing Pads are 
      arranged in a circle around Admin/Support.  Thus, each Landing Pad 
      is adjacent to two Landing Pads (one on either side; LP #1 and LP 
      #8 are adjacent) and to Admin/Support.  Admin/Support is adjacent 
      to each of the Landing Pads.  <p>
</ul>

Author's Notes: 

I detailed the assets by skill (instead of by crew level) to better 
reflect the roleplaying aspect of the game.  In TNE, it is *much* harder 
for a character in the Wilds to get skills from the Space Tech, Space 
Vessel, and Tactics skill clusters than from the Technician cluster (let 
alone, Leadership skill).  <p>

I used the "unskilled attempt penalty" rule from TNE to handle those 
skills that are *not* available to the character(s) belonging the the 
players' teams.  <p>
