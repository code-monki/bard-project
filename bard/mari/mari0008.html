The players are trying to survey a planet that got depopulated during
the Collapse. They find a map hidden in the ruins of a government
office (say hidden behind a false panel in a file cabinet). It's in bad
shape, but they can still read it. It's a map of one of the more remote
areas of the planet, a definite wilderness area. But there are some
cryptic markings on it, indicating that *somethhing* is there, but the
markings don't say what it is. But it's ovbvious, both from the way the
map was hidden, and the fact that the notes are *so* cryptic, that
whatever it is, it was supposed to be *very* secret.
<P>
If they check out the area, they will find traces that indicate that
someone did some *major* construction here, then went to a lot of
trouble to make it look "normal" again.
<P>
Depending on what sort of sensors they have, they'll get various
indications. There are neutrino readings from some areas for instance.
And using "sounding charges" like geologists use will reveal that there
is some sort of *large* complex buried there. It appears to be built to
withstand a major war, and the areas where the tunnels led to the
surface seem to have been sealed *very* thouroghly.
<P>
I'll give you pretty good odds that your average player comes up with
one of the following explanations:
<P>
<LI>Planetary defence center
<LI>Archives
<LI>Treasure repository
<LI>The mother of all fallout shelters, with important people in cold
   sleep until "after the war"
<LI>Doomsday weapon installation.
<LI>Ancient installation that the goverment hid from the people (shades
   of "Area 51" :-)
<P>
Or many other variations on these themes.
<P>
But having read my comments about Love Canal, I bet you've figured it
out already. It's where the goverment buried all the really toxic
waste. The neutrinos are from the decay of nuclear waste. It's secret
because they didn't want the environmentalists after them.
<P>
I expect that typical players will either contaminate the hell out of
themselves, or manage to set set off some of the explosive/flammable
stuff leaking out of corroding drums.  :-)
