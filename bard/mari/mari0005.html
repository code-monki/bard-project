 <h1>Twist of Fate</h1>

<HR>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
  
     This is intended to be a campaign for <cite>Striker II</cite>. The campaign
 is set in the Thoezennt subsector in the Old Expanses sector. It is intended
 to be fought in three distinct battles although it is possible to have
 many more encounters depending on the choices made by the
  PC's. 
<p>
 A mercenary
 contract is up for grabs. It looks like a boring garrison job on
 the planet Nova Ryll(0330). The players should be a mercenary
 unit of at least 2 companies and it is recommended to be a full battalion.
 You may use a pre-designed unit "Harrel's Marauders" or bring 
 in your own unit if you if the players wish. If the Players
 bring in a unit from scatch it should not exceed 100MCr-120 MCr in value.
 It is suggested you look at Nova Ryll in the <cite>Path of Tears</Cite>
 sourcebook.

<h2>Background/The Contract</h2>

 Wen Clossar runs a investment/trading
 company that started from a Coalition branch of Ling Standard. 
 After the virus hit the local branch took the money it had
 and made some wise investments. The name didn't hurt either.
 Ling Standard has found a new deposit of fissionables in The Mark.
 unfortunately it is located very close to the disputed Southmark
 border. Ling Standard could make a killing if they can keep the
 mine open for another 6 months. The Mark has a weak armed forces
 compared to the Southmark forces and has offered little assurance
 of protecting the mine. Several sniper incidents and sabotage
 have caused schedule delays and prompted
 Ling Standard to lay out the money for protection. Ling Standard
 has issued a contract
 for a battalion size mercenary group to garrison the open mine.  
 Due to recent tensions between Southmark and The Mark. The contract
 reads as follows:
<p>

<h2>Nova Ryll background</h2>

    The Mercenaries are working in the country of The Mark.
   It is a small /weak government that is currently going
   through a political upheaval between two rival political
   parties. So far it hasn't gotten to violence.  To the south
    of them is the Southmark empire. 
    The Southmark is a corrupt expansionistic country that
    is deeply in debt. It desperately needs a large cash
    boast to keep the economy (and current government) going.
    The value of the fissionables just over the (disputed)
    border is too much of a temptation. Due to the number of
    of wars in the last 10 years a organization known as
    the League of Marks was created to solve diplomatic
    problems without conflict.
<p>
    <b>Referee's infomation<i> (Optional for roleplaying)</i></b>
     As expected Ling Standard is not telling all. The mine
    is actually a buried miltary depot for Imperial marines.
    The actually make-up and usability is up to the referee ,but
    rememeber even one grav tank can shift the balance of power.

<h2> Scenario one. The Race</h2>
 Time of battle- First days of arrival
<p>
  <b>Background:</b> The mercenary group just finished a tour in the
  country of Eastmark, Nova Ryll.
  They are approached by Mr. Clossar for a security operation
  of about 6 months. They travel by ship to the port city of
  Bastinque (city near starport)  which is the capital. As the mercenaries unload it
  is noticed by Southmark spies who report back the mercenaries
  arrival. The Southmark decide to send in a raid to take
  the mines' fissionables and high-tech mining equipment. As
  a diversion they will also raid several nearby towns and
  destroy the local garrisons. As the raid starts the mercenary
  commander gets a frantic call from Mr Clossar who insists they
  must move out and protect the base at all costs. Information
  available to the players(if they look for it) will be :
<ol>
   <li> Some last messages from the mine when it was overrun
   <li> Some recon from the Marks tiny airforce.<br>
      <i>Note</i>- the Marks military command will be in
            complete disarray
   <li> Some civilian radio traffic from surrounding towns.
</ol>

<p>
 <b>Referee's notes.</b> Scenario one is basically a meeting engagement.
  The fog of war is vital to get a proper "feel" for this battle.
  Xerox a copy of the map and tape it to cardboard. Put stickpins
  on the map for the mercenaries and for contacts/enemy forces
  as they come in. Only show the players the reports they give.
  Do not show them all of the enemy units. You may use the 
  following chart to help determine what to show them:
  Assuming they have put scout forces out ahead of the main
  effort: (Give scout forces 50% greater movement speed-except
  for aircraft/helos which will use normal speed)
<p>
<pre>
    1D6

     1   Unit will be greatly underestimated (50 to 100%)
         (battalions become companies or platoons)
     2-  Unit will be underestimated by 10-30%
     3-4 Truth of unit spotted
     5   Unit will be overestimated by 10-30%
     6   Unit will be greatly overestimated by 50 to 100%
         (platoons become battalions)
</pre>
  The Ref should have his own map with all the forces listed and
  should update them every movement cycle.
<p>
<dl>
<dt>Players movement:

  <dd>Aircraft- 100 kilometers turn
  <dd>motorized- 10 k a turn road/ 3 k off road
  <dd>grab/helo - 50 K a turn 
  <dd>riding- 4 K road/off-road
  <dd>foot-2 K road/ off-road
</dl>
<p>
  Small unit encounters: (scout forces)
   Most small unit encounters will be recon forces. They
  will probably not be played out on the table top, but
  use the following charts to resolve the encounter:
<pre>
   D6
   D1 - force is ambushed roll 4+ to survive
   D2-D3- meeting engagement roll higher than ref to survive
   D4-D5  Enemy sighted without giving away position
   D6-    Enemy ambushed-ref should roll 5+ to survive and pull back
	  enemy forces
</pre>
<hr size=1 color="#ff0000" noshade>
  <h2>Scenario 2. The Siege.</h2>
  Time of battle- Several months after arrival.
<p>
  <b>Political background:</b>
    After the raid by Southmark
    (which they will call a border dispute)they will pull
    back their forces to give the illusion of complying 
    with the LOM wishes.
<p>
 <b> Refs notes:</b>
   The players will have several weeks to prepare their
   base. Unless the players are clueless they will realize
   the future threat of Southmark military. If you wish to 
   have a role playing aspect
   give the PC's some stories about saber rattling and
   tensions between the 2 countries and the League of
   Mark's attempt to solve them diplomatically. The Southmark 
   realizing the panic and weak resistance of The Mark will
   decide to take over the Mark will a lightening strike 
   of military might. Political figures from Southmark will
   secretly bribe Mr.  Clossar to keep the mercenaries out
   of the upcoming battle.
   The Southmark will strike just north of the
   mine heading for the starport and capital. A full division
   of 13 battalions of tank/inf and 4 batts of arty. Southmark
   will enjoy air superiority as well. Although they have a 
   "deal" with Mr. Clossar they will not trust the mercenary
   group and will surround the mining operation with a battalion
   of troops and arty delivered mines.
<p>
  <b>The invasion:</b><br>
     Southmark division<br>
<dl>
   <dd>1 helo company.
   <dd>1 Engineer batt.
   <dd>5 tank batts (1 is reserve)
   <dd>9 armored inf batts.
   <dd>4 arty batts ( 1hvy) the 3 light artys will be assigned to
      each regiment
   <dd>1 regiment will then consist of 3 inf 1 tank and 1 arty batt.
   <dd>1 Antiaircraft batt. -12 tac missle carriers -150mm
</dl>
<p>
  <b>The assault</b><br>
<dl>
   <dd>1 regiment will be assigned to destroy the mercenary forces.
   <dd>After a brief bombardment (possible roll for surprise)
     a secondary attack will occur from the north(1 inf batt)
    <dd>Then the full assault will occur from the south. 
    <dd>1 company of engineers with mine clearing gear will also
     be assigned to the assault.

</dl>

<h2>Scenario 3. The breakout:</h2>


   <b>Invasion update.</b>
   Assuming the mercs survive scenario 2 the situation will
   move into a siege situation. The invasion has slowed down
   near the capital as the Mark forces put up a desperate
   last stand.
<p>
   <b>The Plea</b>
   After 2 days a plea on the
   radio will be heard from the prime minister of the Mark.
   He will plea with the mercs that unless he has their help
   his country will fall. He will offer 10MC and a 10,000
   acre land grant if the mercs
   can break out of the siege and destroy the division hqts
   discovered to be about 30 km north of the mine. 
   
<p>



   <b>Ref Notes</b><br>
     Deployment of enemy forces:<br>
     The Southmark will have a inf batt. with a towed arty 
     battery to hold the siege forces. In addition one company
     of tanks will be in reserve to deal with breakouts.
     Within 5 mins. a flight of 3 attack helos will arrive and
     2 additional batteries of arty will come on call. If the
     players coordinate it with the Mark forces they may be
     able to make the reserve forces committed for a battle
     elsewhere. Roll a d6 for the helos- a 4,5,6 for success
     and roll a d6 for the general support arty for each turn.
     a 5 or 6 means they will have the support. Note that this
     assumes that the attack it coordinated with a attack by
     the Mark forces. If the players do not do that then the
     forces will be dedicated to the attack. The infantry batt.
     will be dug in and will have minefields scattered to the
     front. There will be cleared lanes that are hidden from
     the players. (possible chance of discovery/or info from
     a prisoner). As the merc group travels north they should
     run into rear area forces and some security platoons.
     Just south of the headquarters they will run into
     a ambush set up for them. 
<p>     
<b>Ambush:</b>
<dl>
     <dd>2 squadrons of attack helos- 3helos each.
     <dd>1 squadrons of attack jets- 3 planes
     <dd>2 batteries of 150mm arty support (3 fires of fascam)
     <dd>1 antitank company of 12 lancer missle carries
     <dd>1 scatch force:
<dl>
       <dd>3 abomination siege tanks
       <dd>2 TL14 intrepid grav tanks
       <dd>6 pararie fire TL8 tanks
       <dd>1 company of infantry (motorized in trucks)
       <dd>1 company of engineers- with minelayers and
          mines, 2 bull dozers for tank ditches etc.
       <dd>1 AA group (tac missiles)-4 vehicles(sim to adatts)
</dl></dl>
      The Southmark will either set up in a reverse slope 
      defense behind a large hill, or a woods ambush depending
      on the route the mercs take. Other scattered forces may
      be encountered (up to company strength) and also may
      reinforce this group. You can roll for this every 3 or 4 turns...
<pre>
      a 5 or 6 on a D6.
       1-2 - A tank company of parire fire tanks (6 tanks)
       3-4   A antitank battery of 4 lancer missle carriers
       5-  A motorized inf. company- 6 plts
       6-  A extra artillery battery of 4 150mm howizters
</pre>

     If the mercs defeat this force the headquaters will be
     5 KM up the road. There is little resistance and the
     Southmark attack will soon fold. If the referee desires
     you could set up one last battle of the now retreating
     Southmark forces trying to break thru the merc forces
     on their way home.
