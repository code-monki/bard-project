A TNE Adventure for a party of 6-8 adventurers, ship optional. Year 1203
Part 1 of a 3-part campaign taking the PCs into the heart of the Old Expanses.
<p>
After a hazardous foray into the wilds, the RCES Ship "XXXXXXX" dropped in to the Trybec system for some urgently needed repair and some gratefully received R&R for the crew, however, upon contacting Dawn Base approach control, they get an encrypted data transmission along with the more usual approach details.
Decoding the message will reveal it is a short note from Sid "Papa" Papagopolis.
"Hello, old friends, I hope it wasn't to bad a trip, sorry to cut your celebrations short, but I need to see you at Kruyter as soon as you can make it. Swing by Vesna starport, they have priority instructions to send you on your way with all possible speed" and with that the message ends.
As soon as the PCs ship docks it will be swarmed by maintenance staff and cargo loaders. Any salvage will be offloaded and will disappear into the depths of the auction storage areas. Davion Shreck, a representative of the Trybec Holding Corporation (Trybecs effective government) will assure any worried PCs that their salvage will be safely stored and that he will personally ensure that it gets a good price. Davion is a tall thin black man, dressed in an orange suit and sports a RC broach on his lapel. He is used to dealing with the RCES and lancers, and is a loyal RC administrator. He will actually ensure that the PCs get a good deal on their salvage (+1 to any applicable rolls for the value of salvage sold). However, he does not know anything about Sid's message, except that he has orders to get the PCs to Kruyter as soon as possible. The ship's mechanics swarming over the ship don't know anything either. This may start to get the PCs worried - good!. So after a few short hours, just enough to fill the fuel tanks and clean the windshield, the PCs are off to Kruyter.
<p>
In the next seven days, the PCs will have plenty of time to get themselves very worried. They will also have time to catch up on several months of mail and news that was downloaded into their computer. Astute PCs will scan the news for any hints of what could be instore. (The <a HREF="../bardgail.html">Coalition Information Net</A> downloads are a good source of news). Canny PCs may note the news of troop and ship movements to the Coalition's trailing border, and the first few skirmishes between the RC and Solee (first two battles of Dunas), Smart PCs will also notice the mentions of the fleet training facilities under construction at Kruyter.
<p>
Emerging from jump, a quick sensor scan will detect three small inbound targets approaching fast. Opening communications, or a formidable sensor scan task will identify the incoming ships as a flight of RC <I>Wildbat</I> fighters guarding the gas giant. They will cheerfully greet the PCs (assuming some trigger happy PC has not opened up on them), and direct them to Kruyter Starport. Passing through the system, the PCs will detect a large amount of activity, both normal commercial traffic moving across the Coalition, and in system craft setting up the training facility.
<p>
Upon arrival at Kruyter Down, Sid will be waiting for them at the airlock, He will shush any questions from the PCs as he falls in step with them on the way to a briefing room. He will however smile, and say its nothing a team like the PCs can't handle. This will probably get the PCs very worried. Sid will usher the PCs into a nearby briefing room, with a large view port overlooking the starport and the PCs ship, where in sits a middle aged, slightly overweight and rather small man, dressed in a well made grey informal jump suit.
<p>
Sid will gesture for the PCs to sit down and make themselves comfortable. He will then introduce the man as "Angus Trantor" of the Coalition Diplomatic service. Angus, despite his rather gruff name is a small shy, middle aged, middle ranked diplomat, who is slightly nervous around such adventurous and famous people (and just a little afraid, of a group of people who have probably battled the virus and toppled governments). Angus will then make a short presentation.
<p>
"As you are aware, the Coalition has recently opened a trade route to Sitah and the Hiver client states there. The RC has decided to open diplomatic relations with these worlds, and has already despatched a full ambassador, with a small staff of course. However, the RCSA's diplomatic wing has decided to expand our facilities on the main world of Renj to full embassy status". Then drawing himself upto his full 5ft 6inch stature, Angus will proudly proclaim " I have been chosen as the first secretary to the mission on Renj". He will then become quite animated as he details the important work that the embassy will do and his own role in the grand diplomatic scheme of things. Most PCs will probably be starting to drop off after about ten minutes of administrative minuet. Just as the PCs are considering shooting this guy, Sid will interrupt.
<p>
"You are probably wondering what this has got to do with you, well to be blunt, we need your ship, the naval training facility here at Kruyter needs realistic opponents for the navy to play with, and your ship fits the bill of a modified wilds vessel to a tee". "Don't worry," he hastily adds " you will get it back as good as new, and we will even fix some of the dents" as he gazes out of the viewport at the PCs battered ship. "We want you to take the RC courier <I>Crepuscule</I> and transport our diplomatic comrades to their new assignment". The last sentence is said without a hint of irony. At this point, Angus will excuse himself; "there is still a tonne of paperwork to do".
<p>
The PCs will probably ask Sid what the heck is going on, and why they have to babysit a bunch of penpushers. Sid will reply "I know that it seems a waste of time, but think for a minute, the whole aim of the Coalition is to grow and rebuild civilisation, so we should contact these guys. Also it will allow us to use their facilities to surround Solee and attack them from the rear. Also those diplomats make a nice bunch of hostages, and they will be taking codebooks and other sensitive information with them. I don't think there will be any trouble, but I thought it would be a good idea to send a few sheep dogs to guard our diplomatic sheep". With this though hanging, Sid will bid them goodnight and give them directions to their rooms.
<p>
Next morning, the PCs will get their first sight of the RC Courier <I>Crepuscule</I>, and may be slightly disappointed. The <I>Crepsucle</I> is a modified TL12 <I>Petty</I> class subsidised merchant, outfitted with J3 drives. The PCs can gain the following information on the ship.
Easy space ops task roll: basic ships performance, J3, 1G, sensor/ commo types, weapons compliment.
Routine Space ops task roll: sensor capabilities and ranges, weapon performance.
The stats for the <I>Silvanus</I> merchant are presented in Star Vikings Personalities of the Coalition, Page 44. with the following modifications can be used for the <I>Crepsucle</I>:<BR>
<B>Commo:</B> 30,000km radio, 1000Au maser<BR>
<B>Sensors:</B> PEMS fixed array 60,000km, AEMS 3,000km.<BR>
<B>Weaponry:</B> Two TL-11 laser turrets locations 2 and 3, 1 TL11 missile turret with 2 ready missiles location 4; one TL11 sandcaster turret with 20 canisters, location 5.<BR>
<B>Fire Control:</B> 1 MFD TL=8, Ignores 1 difficulty modification.<BR>
<B>Jump Fuel:</B> 1120m<BR>
<B>Cargo:</B> 634.5m<BR>
<p>
A difficult space ops task roll will highlight a few disturbing facts:
1) There are no extra missiles or sandcaster canisters on board.
2) The fuel plant has not been upgraded to cope with the extra jump fuel. It will now take 18 hours to refine the fuel tankage.
<p>
A look at the cargo passenger manifest will further discourage the PCs. The hold is full of forms, computers, office equipment, luxury food and drink, formal wear for the staff and even an ornate desk for the ambassador. One of the low berths holds the ambassadors' dog, while two more have been used to preserve delicate food and wines for diplomatic parties. There are two crates of more interesting stuff, but they are labelled as "forms - procurement". One crate contains BW vests, standard coalition ACRs, 2 LMGs, ammo, and a secure satellite maser uplink for defence of the embassy. The second crate contains a selection of TL12+ intelligence gear for the embassy's intel department, as well as Cr500,000 in gold and other items for financing an intelligence network. The passenger manifest details the following:<BR>
Oriflamme Marine Guard:<BR>
Oriflamme Marine Guard:<BR>
First Secretary: Angus Trantor<BR>
Second Secretary: Arthur Crichton<BR>
Third Secretary: Suzanne Guiscard<BR>
Third Secretary: Dolph Jaeger<BR>
Senior Administrative Officers (3):Anna Krueger, Thomas M'Benka, Dominique Dumouriez<BR>
Assistant Administrative Officers (4):James Rand, Charlotte Rand, Patrick Lemieux, Gina Morelli<BR>
<p>
The marines will be picked up at Oriflamme.
<p>
An easy admin or space ops task will pull up the ships flight plan:
Kruyter: Zolga: Oriflamme: Spencer: Tuer: Poyzen: Dunbar: Dimeola: Wildman: Zolibe: Renj
<p>
Just before launch, a small package will be delivered to the ship, addressed to the PCs. It is a present from Sid: a TL13 Holo Player with a few imperial era films on crystal including that RCES favourite "2001". A note says "this should make the voyage a bit more tolerable" and is signed Sid.
<p>
Upon arrival at Oriflamme, there will be a slight delay, only one of the marines is ready to embark from the gas giant's transit station. The other marine had suffered a broken leg and a replacement is on the way from Oriflamme and will arrive in 8 hours. Suspicious PCs may read more into this than has actually happened. The accident was real and the replacement marine is a fine soldier. The marine already at the transit station is also a fine soldier and a member of the Oriflamme rebels.
<p>
The journey out of the subsector will be uneventful, with a short but relaxing stop over at the Baldur colony on Poyzen. (The referee may add details of the Poyzen colony if PCs have been involved in setting this colony up - See World Tamers Handbook). The So Skire subsector beckons.
<HR>
<h4>So Skire Subsector</h4>

Dunbar:
Whilst the ship is refuelling in the Dunbar system, the communications operator will detect a weak broadcast signal from the Dunbar itself. It is a broadcast to any Hiver ship in-system requesting technological aid. If the PCs go to assist and approach the planet, radio communications can be established with the sender. The sender turns out to be a small ecological group, who are worried about the potential salvage operation being performed on planet. They will suggest a meeting at the players choice of location. The local government is friendly - having been contacted by the hivers, and the ship can land at the D class starport. Two members of the ecological group "Protectors of Dunbar" will meet the players, they are a man: Duncan Eerii and a woman: Clarrissa Adams. They will brief the PCs that an infectious disease is currently ravaging the planets main domesticated groat herds. Whilst the disease is harmless to humans, it is causing serious problems for the planets economy, with the resulting minor civil unrest by the affected farming communities. The planetary government has contracted a local firm "Gilden Pharmaceuticals" to find a cure. Gilden plans to open a relic research lab in the hopes of finding a cure. Remaining records list the site as a major veterinary centre. The protectors are worried that the salvage team will release biotoxins that make the current epidemic seem like child's play.
If the PCs approach "Gilden" directly, they will get a standard press pack of information, which gives a calming optimistic corporate message. They will not allow the PCs to visit the site, nor will they discuss details of the salvage activities quoting "commercial confidentiality".
If the PCs approach the government, they will get the government's version of the press pack. A difficult admin task roll will get the PCs with a junior official within the agricultural ministry. Garth Simmons will attempt to re-assure the PCs that Gilden has passed all the governments safety criteria and that the salvage will be undertaken under the most stringent safety procedures.
PCs being PCs will probably not believe this and will attempt more direct action:
<p>
1: Computer Infiltration. The PCs may attempt to hack into "Gilden's" computer network. However Dunbar was only TL6 before the collapse and has dropped to TL5. Gilden does have a computer but it is valve (ie vacuum tubes) driven relic with no connections to the outside world. The PCs will need to break in to access it, and any attempts to operate the computer will be conducted at minus two difficulty levels due to the PCs unfamiliarity with such primitive technology. Any PC efforts will be wasted, the computer is used to perform complex calculations, and contains no information on the salvage site.
<p>
2: Break in to Gilden HQ. The gilden corporate HQ is located within the business district of Dunbar's capital city: Stirling. It will be deserted at night except for a small security gatehouse containing two unarmed guards who will patrol the site at regular intervals and phone the police if they discover something amiss. The business district is subject to regular police patrols, but is generally quiet after business hours. If the PCs ransack the offices, it will take a formidable admin task roll to find the relevant files amongst the mass of paperwork associated with the workings of a major company. Difficult admin rolls will find minor errors / discrepancies within the project workfiles - a few documents not signed off, a few plans and procedures still in draft state, but nothing really incriminating. If the PCs present these documents to the government they will have to explain how they acquired them and may be arrested. The government will review the evidence and the licensing authority will make a few minor demands on Gilden - mainly that they will not approve the starting of the salvage operation until all these loose ends are sorted out. This will delay the salvage operation approximately 1 month with only minor effects on the agricultural crisis.
<p>
3: Breaking into the salvage site. The salvage site consists of a number of tents holding the staff and a few prefabricated building containing the temporary research facilities. Any PCs with a scientific background will detect primitive decontamination facilities set up just outside the ruins of the old research lab. The staff consists of three biologists plus a dozen graduate staff who will do most of the legwork within the ruined facility + three roadies responsible for the general upkeep of the camp. The camp is equipped with two radios, three trucks, half a dozen jeeps and a half-track. Two of the roadies are armed, one with a pistol for self defence, whilst the other enjoys hunting and carries a TL5 rifle with telescopic sights and may be encountered several kms from the camp during daylight hours attempting to bag a few rabbits for the pot. If the PCs raid the camp and investigate the temporary lab they may find evidence of minor infringements of the safety regulations. If they present this to the government, the results will be similar to 2 above + the PCs will definitely have to explain why they have raided a restricted area. If they enter the ruined research facility, they will eventually discover the labs in the heart of the complex. These are wrecked and there is no usable salvage or information to be found. Any PCs with a scientific background will realise that the real information will be found in the labs archives. A routine recon task roll will discover the access to the underground archives. Here is a large darkened room with masses of paper files detailing the lab's research before the collapse. It will take weeks to sift through this lot. A PC will notice a large steel door in one corner of the archive. Again scientific PCs will recognise this as a freezer used to maintain samples in a control temperature. The door is jammed shut.
If the PCs leave now, they may be subject to arrest depending upon the amount of evidence they left behind. The Gilden research team will find the clues they need within the records and within two months they will have a vaccine. The planet will suffer no more than a few impoverished farmers (who will be compensated by the government) and a doubling of local meat prices for a few years until the herds are restored.
If they barge into the freezer - by blowing the door off, they will probably ignite the various chemicals within freezer and cause a secondary explosion (equal to two incendiary grenades) that will set fire to the old records. Without these records, the research effort will fail and the local herds will be decimated. The government will be forced to impose rationing, and civil unrest will rack the planet for several months until the hivers can send emergency relief from the Sitah subsector. Oops!!
<p>
The rest of the journey through the So Skire Subsector will be uneventful - this is a cleared trade route after all. The biggest problem that the PCs will encounter is the rather boring company of their passengers. The Crepsucle will soon enter the Sitah Subsector

<HR>
<h4>Sitah Subsector</h4>

<a href="../opal/opal3028.html">Zolibe</A>
The PCs will be getting quite bored by now, they have not had any action since the affair on Dunbar, and even the last contact with a merchant vessel was two jumps back, but now they are only one jump from Renj. Angus paints quite an exciting picture, an new high population world with a TL11 at the centre of a small star faring community.
So they may be rather surprised to be jumped by a pirate ship whilst attempting gas giant refuelling. Initial sensor scans will give a mixed response: whilst the pirate vessel is smaller than the <I>Crepuscule</I> at only 300dtns, it is an imperial era warship - a <I>Gazelle</I> close escort (without its drop tanks). There is a small sitah facility on the sole moon of the first gas giant, but it is a refuelling station and can not help. The PCs are probably outclassed here, but PCs then to be resourceful. Let them try all their sneaky underhand tricks to defeat the pirate. But before the <I>Crepuscule</I> is completely wrecked, the calvary will arrive. The pirate will suddenly turn and accelerate away from the gas giant. The PCs probably have minimum sensors by this time, but they too will soon detect two large sensor echoes closing on the pirates at high acceleration. After a short but one-sided battle the pirate will be destroyed and the two sensor contacts will identify themselves as a pair of hiver destroyers (TL14, 5ktns). The reason for this navel presence will soon be revealed as a hiver tender enters sensor range. The Tender can repair the <I>Crepuscule</I>. This gives the PCs the perfect chance to meet some hivers and their ever-friendly Ithklur marines.
<p>
<a href="../opal/opal3030.html">Renj</A>
 Renj is a high population waterworld B86A998-B with a huge volume of traffic, greater than even Oriflamme or Aubuline. There are still imperial era bulk carriers in operation, plus hiver vessels (both the tenders and transports the PCs are familiar with, and hiver naval units including a 40ktn light cruiser). The PCs even pass a 100,000Ktn monitor on their journey in-system.
The PCs RC identification will get them a priority access to the starport and soon they will be unloading their diplomatic cargo at Syrim downport. The PCs will have several days to enjoy the sights. Then they will receive a summons from the Coalition embassy and are again met by Angus.
He says that the ambassador has another small errand for them. Whilst the embassy has the official data onto various worlds with the subsector supplied by the Renj government, the ambassador wants some first hand independent reports of what is actually out there. The ambassador has already sent a message back to the coalition stating that he is "appropriating the RC courier Crepuscule and its crew for official RC business". and he has the power to do so, being the highest ranking RC official in a dozen parsecs.
(For Referees: The oriflamme marine rebel is conducting a few unofficial activities of his own. He is exploring Renj culture to see if: a) it will make a suitable hide out for the rebels, b) he can find another government structure that could be used on Oriflamme, he will eventually try to contact the Minotaurs within the Renj government; c) if the contacts with b go well he may attempt to approach the hivers via the Renj government to see if they can intervene back home - or at least perform a few manipulations on the Oriflamme Technarchs. The referee is left to develop this adventure seed as he sees fit).
<p>
The worlds the ambassador would like information on consist of:
Zolibe; Zoquet; Quell; Osmosis; New Luck; Miisha; Markham; Mackloud; Jowaa; Delphinium; Darinov; Dahlgren; Cassiopia; Carmen; An Cizow; Adam; and Surren.
The ambassador will leave the actual planning to the PCs.
<p>
<a href="../opal/opal3032.html">Zoquet</A>
On the minor outpost of Zoquet, the PCs will be invited to spend a few weeks. The locals don't get many visitors and are keen to hear about the outside universe. The PCs can spend a few weeks working in the fields / helping with the salvage / helping with the base operations and exchanging tales at night around the fire, while obtaining their first hand cultural and survey information.
<p>
One day, one or more of the PCs (the less technically minded ones such as the medic) will be out examining the agricultural system (i.e. visiting a farm) accompanied by a crowd of local children who have come to see the spacemen. They will be surveying the plains from a sheer escarpment overlooking a fast flowing river, whilst one of the local farmers explains their expansion plans. Unfortunately the children start to play, and one thing leads to another and a small 5-year old boy ends up tumbling down the escarpment towards the river. The escarpment is too steep to just walk down and rescue the boy. The PCs will need to climb down (any mountaineers - the climb consists of two difficult climb task, climbing up is also two difficult tasks (or formidable task roll is carrying the boy)) or fly down if they have a grav belt.
A successful rescue will gain the PCs the gratitude of the local community. Prior to the PCs departure the locals will throw a celebratory feast, and present the PCs with a gift to show their appreciation. The PCs will be awarded a certificate of thanks (always good for the coalitions reputation) and a single piece of jewellery - a large single crystal hanging from a silver chain.
<p>
The PCs will recognise the crystal not as a gem but as a holo-crystal (thanks to their experience with Sid's present). Playing the crystal in the holo-player will reveal that it is encrypted but the screen will display the emblem of the IISS. The ship board computer will not be able to crack the code, but the RC embassy has better facilities. The PCs will probably high tail it to Renj to get the crystal decoded. the RC embassy computer department will be able to decode the crystal (based upon codes recovered from the old scout base at Trybec). It is a set of xboat messages that passed through the local scout base in 1108. The messages are marked as originating from the Imperial Navy.  Further analysis indicates that they are inventory requests from naval bases in the trailing half of the sector for a period in mid-1108. These type of records tend to be very boring and generally not very useful. The RC computer operator will set the system checking for unusual items and go home for the night. The PCs will get an excited video call from the overnight computer supervisor that their search has turned up something unusual. When the PCs arrive back at the embassy, they can review the results of the search. It is a requisition order from the naval base at Torrel and is addressed to the naval facilities on Terra in the Solomani Rim. It is signed by Vice Admiral Armund Buchanan, Imperial Navy (Old Expanses Sector, Ship Safety Department, Depot / Old Expanses) and requests PSI shielding equipment.
<p>
This is curious:
1) Why does the Imperial Navy need PSI shielding so far from the Zhodani threat?
2) Why get the stuff from Terra, according to the old records, there are no major storage depots on Terra?
3) What has PSI shielding got to do with a vice admiral from the ship safety department?
<p>
Again, via Angus, the RC ambassador will think this is sufficiently strange to be worth investigating. Fortunately he has a high jump ship and an experienced crew available i.e. the PCs.
<p>
The PCs are authorised to draw upon RC stores and resources to plan and execute an exploration mission to Torrel in the heart of what was the Old Expanses Sector
<p>

The PCs Journey to Torrel will be detailed in Part 2 of the Campaign - Eye of the Beast
<p>
<HR>
<h4>Cast of Characters</h4>
<P>
<B>Oriflamme Marine Guard: Kalyeen Mercer</B><BR>
Kayleen is an experienced marine trooper who is being rested after a few too many SAG missions. In reality, she was involved in the oriflamme occupation of spencer and has been moved to the rear echelons for her own good. She has been appalled by the actions of the Technarchs on Spencer and is now a member of the rebels, hoping for a better government on Oriflamme.

<P>
<B>Oriflamme Marine Guard: Enuli Killicanu</B><BR>
Enuli is from a vilani-descended family that still cling to the old vilani traditions. The affects of the collapse have further increased his dislike of technology. He is happy with his standard and trusty ACR, and favours the low tech approach over fancy high tech.

<P>
<B>First Secretary: Angus Trantor</B><BR>
Angus is a small shy middle aged, well-attired career diplomat. He is rather nervous around strangers but opens up once he gets to know people. He is interested in the details of his job, and will often boor those around him with insignificant details. He is also rather impressed with his current position and will talk as if the fate of the coalition depended upon his every action. However, he is basically a good man, he will even go as far as to physically help the PCs but within limits (i.e. hitting a pirate over the head from behind, if the ship is attacked and a PC is in danger of dying. He is married to a doctor and has three small boys.
<P>
<B>Second Secretary: Arthur Crichton</B><BR>
Arthur has risen to the position of Second Secretary by dint of both hard work, working away and the retirement / departure of the more senior members of staff. Arthur is a devoted family man with a wife and two young boys. Arthur likes spending time at the pub. He can be a bit crude at times, especially about the opposite sex.
<P>
<B>Third Secretary: Suzanne Guiscard</B><BR>
Suzanne is a woman in a man's word, and tends to be seen in masculine attire (trouser suits etc.)and has short hair. She is a competent administrator specialising in trade and commercial areas. She still likes femine things (usually house furnishings) and is an avid reader. She is happily married with no children.
<P>
<B>Third Secretary: Dolph Jaeger</B><BR>
Dolph is a middle-aged diplomat (age 34) who has risen rapidly through the ranks, unfortunately based upon his friendship with Arthur Crichton and threats to leave the service rather than true ability. He has married into a well to do family and is desperately trying to keep up with his relatives more affluent lifestyles. He is chronically short of money, having spent in all on flash hotels, fine meals, expensive cars etc. He has a wife and a small child.
<P>
<h4>Senior Administrative Officers (3):</h4>
<B>Anna Krueger</B><BR>
Anna is a older woman (late 50s) working steadily within here field. Unfortunately she has an annoying laugh and is not a great social person. She is however very good with computers etc. She is normally found in the company of Suzanne Guiscard.
<P>
<B>Thomas M'Benka</B><BR>
Thomas is a middle aged (33) senior administrative officer, who has been in various branches of the service since he left university. He is quiet around most people except his friends, when he can be quite outspoken and sarcastic. He generally feels aggrieved that Doplh has been promoted over him, despite equal abilities just because of dolph's friendship with senior staff. He is married with a small girl. Thomas has a painful stomach disease, which there is current no cure for. He will be interested in any relic medical technology that could help. He has experience of numerous combat simulation games (the equivalent of paint ball) and if required will help the PCs. However the experience of actual combat may be more than he bargained for.
<P>
<B>Dominique Dumouriez</B><BR>
Dominique is a friendly young (late twenties) admin officer. She has risen rapidly due to hard work and the willingness to undertake the less popular tasks including significant working away from home. She is a large stocky woman. Unfortunately the job has cost her here marriage after only three years, and she is still uncomfortable with it.
<P>
<h4>Assistant Administrative Officers </h4>
<B>James Rand</B><BR>
James is a middle aged (50) administrative officer. He is quiet around people, but is gruffly friendly. He is a large well-built man, but suffers from a number of chronic illnesses.
<P>
<B>Charlotte Rand</B><BR>
Charlotte is a middle aged (45) administration assistant. She has three daughters (late teens) and several cats. She has been divorced, but has recently remarried. She is quietly outgoing, and is generally nice and good fun. She is an extremely competent administrator.
<P>
<B>Patrick Lemieux</B><BR>
Patrick Lemieux is a junior diplomat specialising in environmental aspects. He has participated in several surveys of low-tech worlds, and has often been alone in quite remote spots. He is classed as experienced when considering survival / recon type skills. He is still a single young man and enjoys the responsibility free lifestyle. He is also an experienced hill walker and mountain climber.
<P>
<B>Gina Morelli</B><BR>
Gina is a typical young (18)female admin assistant, who sees work as a means to pay for her week-end partying. She is happy and carefree, but is still a competent if junior administrative assistant.
