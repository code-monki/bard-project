232-1080 Imperial Navy HQ Capital:<p>
The Imperial Navy issues a call for designs for a TL-15 system
defense boat designed to protect naval bases and other high
priority military targets.  The SDB should be under 1000 tons 
displacement.  The design should be heavily armed and capable
of engaging opponents of larger size.  Cost is an issue and
any boat going over 650MCr, should justify this cost, and should
provide enough benfits that it is overwhelming superior to a
cheaper boat.

<p>
The SDB will be used as by the heroic forces of the Empire of Solee in
their battle against
the expansionistic Reformation Coalition in the year 1202.
