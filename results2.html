The <b><i>Fearless</i></b> Vampire Hunter by Eamon Watters.

Here is the original contest story:<p>

As the Regency opened its borders hundreds of thousands of people left
civilization to make their fortunes in the Wilds. Most of these people
went their separate ways, but here and there outposts were established
and these led to even bigger colonies.  One of those colonies was on
Seplus in Corridor Sector.  A Trading firm out of Mora, had established
a free trade zone at the starport in exchange for technical assitance
to the Legate of Seplus.  This port attracted thousands of other
starfarers. These were citizens of the Regency, Vargr Corsairs, Free
Traders and wanderers.<p>

   Everything was going great, until the <i>Singing Sword</i> jumped into the
system on 245-1205.  The <i>Singing Sword</i> was 
a Far Trader out of Deneb, engaged in
the recovery of rare art and historical artifacts.  They expected to
spend a week or so picking up supplies and engaging in a bit of R&R on
Seplus, but when they emerged from jump they found the entire plane
had been wiped out. All of Seplus's cities and towns were smoking
craters.  The planet had been subjected to several days of sustained
orbital bombardment, by hyper velocity deadfall ordinance. The <i>Singing Sword</i>
found no survivors and quickly left the system to spread the news.<p>

   While no evidence of a culprit was found, it was almost universally
accepted that a fleet of Vampire ships had attacked Seplus.  Though
occasional rumours of Imperial or Alien involvment surface, all but the
most fringe media outlets discount these rumours.  When the news of a
major Vampire attack got back to the Regency, the masses quickly
demanded action.  The Senate quickly passed a resolution granting up to
100,000 tons of shipping to be constructed and sent into the Wilds to
hunt down and destroy any and all Virus and Vampire infestations.  <p>

The Vampire Hunter can be of any size, as long as the total tons of
shipping be less then or equal to 100,000 tons.  This can be used to
build 1000  100ton ships or one 100,000 ton ship.  The decision is left
up to the individual design team.  The Senate knew they weren't experts
in naval tactics, and decided to leave the decision of which was the
best strategy up to a blue ribbon panel of retired naval personel. The
panel will judge the designs on how  well they preform the given task
of hunting down and destroying Vampires.<p>

The ships can be built at any Regency shipyard, of what ever TL, the
design team feels is appropriate.  It should be noted that the Regency
does have three TL-16 shipyards. Though the construction queue for
these is longer than at the TL-15 yards.<p>
