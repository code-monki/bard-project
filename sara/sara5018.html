Every starfleet needs a vast number of these unglamourous ships - although 
you never seem to see them in "Imperial Stars", "Strike Fleet", or any of the 
other popular VR entertainment programs in the Imperium.  Never mind 
that: without thousands and thousands of glorified cargo barges like these, 
the Imperial Navy would swiftly grind to a halt. <p>

First built in 138, these flying bricks perfectly reflect the big, bulky 
and dour design philosophy of the Vilani.  They also happen to be quite 
capable in their work: after all, 1000 years later they still serve in 
innumerable frontier fleets, as tankers and second-tier naval logstics 
vessels.<P>
  
(In a pinch they can support Marine contigments, but lack the
armour to serve in any more hostile environment than your typical 
bushfire rebellion.  They also lack sufficent on-board cargo shuttles, 
and the Marines get to sleep in the cargo hold - hopefully modified to 
house them, rather than sleeping on the bare floor. <P>

The Orrimot DOES at least have CG lifters, unlike most dedicated space 
tankers/freighters.  So it can lift off, as well as land...)<P>

These ships are rarely seen in civilian service: the two large hamster cages 
used to mimic gravity is rather unpopular among merchants, and civilian 
fuel stations have rendered tanker jumpships a poor economic gamble.  
Also, most merchants find the additional cost to maintain the inefficent 
dual fusion plants not worth the greater safety margin.  And the 10 
lifeboats are SO passe, and an unnecessary expense - although the crews 
doesn't seem to mind.<P>


Well, the Orrimot is just the oldest and the most primitive of the vast 
(an I mean VAST) array of cargo/refuelers that has been built for the 
Imperial Navy over the centuries.  "Ugly, stinky, and full of odd grinding 
noises" is the usual shorthand description.  Cheap, also, for it's purpose: 
discounts on the price may hit 80%, since the basic model's so well 
known.  Even it's base price is quite reasonable for a tanker of it's 
type, as it lacks expensive artificial gravity.  For the cash-strapped 
colonial and planetary navies which need a handy jump-3 tanker/cargo 
ship, this is the way to go.<P>

I would feel that it's unpopularity would stem from the hard-to-find 
part's and supplies it needs, as it was designed before most of 
the modern Imperial Naval Part's spec's were set.  Fortunately, the Orrimot 
spec's are usually ancient ancestors to today's spec's, and the 
relationship is close enough so that, even if you can't find exactly 
what you're looking for, you can jury-rig something fairly easily.<P>

Just don't expect to win any popularity contest with the Orrimot.  Even 
the crew of <I>Morraine</I> free traders - who's TL A design isn't exactly 
cutting edge technology - enjoy sneering at the Orrimot's obvious hamster 
cages<P>
<ul>
  "Hamster cages? What museum did you rob?  Don't tell me: you 
  Solomani/Humans/Imperials STILL don't get artigrav technology, don't 
  you?" <P>
 
  "Ten liferafts?  Obviously, you don't QUITE trust your pilot - not that 
  I blame you, seeing the sorry excuse of a landing approach you made..."
and overall cheapness."<P>
  "Yeah, just look for the Orrimot.  You know, the building with 
   the stubby wings slapped on it's sides.  Watch out though, the 
   crystaliron (giggleSNORT) hull's a bit rusty, chunks of it might lick 
    your head if you bang on it too hard..."<P>
</ul>
However, Vilani with a sense of history and tradition (ie: all Vilani) will 
get a kick of crewing a Orrimot, extolling it's solid, no-nonsense 
stability and falling in love with it's profoundly ancient control 
interfaces <P>
<ul>  "Hey, don't you just LOVE these piloting gauges! I mean, they're 
   pratically ANALOG!  And I bet the wiring hasn't been changed since the 
   Zhutastu Dynasty!"<P>
  "Well, I don't know about this software..."<P>
  "What?  WRITTEN CODE?"  Shoves doubtful captain aside, look over code 
  "Yes!  Hold on a minute... maybe it's..." Praticaly explodes with joy on 
   the bridge "JUMP TAPES!  Genuine JUMP TAPES, without any of those cheap 
   modern upgrades!"<P>
  Captain turns ashen. "You mean we have to buy blindingly expensive 
   jumptapes for *every* *single* *system* we want to visit?"
  The Vilani engineer - with a delighted gleam in her eye - replies
   "Absolutely! Just like in The Good Old Days!"<P>
  Captains' eyes roll into her head as she crumples to the floor.<P>
 
</ul>
Actually, until Norris upgraded so many systems, there were several areas 
within the Spinward Marches where the Orrimot's technology and weaponry 
was actually superiour to anything locally produced (speaking of civilian 
ships, of course).  Which goes to show why Marchmen were considered the 
poor and violent hicks of the Third Imperium - any system that can be 
dominated by an Orrimot is DEFINITELY out of the loop. <P>
<ul>
   Overheard in a Gushemege bar, 1109:<P>
  "The Spinward Marches are so poor, you could conquer half the worlds 
   with nothing but a few Orrimot's and ten FGMP-15's."<P>
  "The Zho's seem to have a rough time of it..."<P>
  "No FGMP-15's."<P>
</ul>
In the Spinward Marches (pre-Rebellion), there were far more Orrimot's 
being used as refuellers to support C- and D-level ports then were 
actually used as cargo ships. (Sometimes, the only difference between them 
was that if the Orrimot's fuel refining equipment still worked, the port 
was cassified "C": if not, then it was "D")<P>
