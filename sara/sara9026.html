The <I>Animal</I> class Safari Ship is a relic of
much more prosperous times.  During the Last Imperium,
corporations often chartered wilderness junkets to
entertain clients and honored guests, or to reward
company executives.  Essentially the Safari Ship is a
yacht for hunting and wilderness expeditions. On the
spacelanes of the Imperium, it was referred to as the
"Manta Camper", in reference to its flying wing shape,
and otherwise extravagant purpose.  Despite this,
thousands were manufactured for nobles and private
companies, and surplus vessels made their way into the
hands of outfitters and private individuals.  The
Collapse has thrust these vessels into a commercial
role. The Regency starship shortage has meant that
owners have held on to their ships as long as
possible, and have recycled them for use in light
passenger and courier duties.  Examples in the Wilds
may run the gamut from commercial use to military
purposes.
<P>
The Skiff and Air Raft are usually deployed from
either orbit, or from an established base camp, and
are primarily used to reduce the amount of "intrusion"
that would come from having to use the Safari Ship in
a mobile manner. The quality of the ship's
construction depended upon the manufacturer, with
Safari Ships manufactured by Tukera being of very high
quality, and those produced by General Shipyards being
the epitome of mediocrity.  Most surviving examples
were of the highest manufacturing quality.
(Ironically, GP absorbed a good deal of Tukera's
surviving shipyard capacity in the Regency, including
support services and quality assurance.)
