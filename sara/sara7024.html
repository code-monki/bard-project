The <I>Starhauler</I> has been called the the <I>Petty</I>-class Trader's big
 brother, It does look like a larger version of the subsidized merchant.  It
 was originally a Solomani trading ship used by a minor corporation for long
 distance hauling, its jump-3 engines give it an advantage over most small
 free traders and a number of versions of the ship have been seen for example, a
 passenger liner.  Even a light escort ship, or a Q-ship version was tried.
 A number of the class was found in the wrecked space docks over Lote.
 <P>
 Since their
 recovery, the ships were auctioned off to  corporations, like KruyterCrop.
One was used to haul refined metal to Aurora and Aubaine. The Crew named her
 <I>Godzilla</I>, after a old Solomani 2-D movie,starting a trend, naming the ships
 after old Japanese monster movies. since the start of hostilities with the
 Empire of Solee, the RC has operated most of the ships for transport of
 equipment to the Shenk subsector. Its ability to roll on and roll off cargo
 and its long legs in the form of its jump-3 engines make it almost ideal.
The only problem with the class is its high cost, over 240 MCr, and its
 slow sublight speed, just 1G. On the plus side it is very well armed,
  with 4 sockets for turrets, 2 MFD's and a missile barbette. 
     The Coalition currently has five ships of this class, the <I>Godzilla</I>, the
 <I>Rodan</I>, the <I>Gamera</I>,  <I>Mothra</I> and the <I>Frankenstein</I>. 
 The Frankenstein was
 owned by a Luthalan, firm. The owner had the interior madeover with a
 gothic stone look.  The crews are a mix of Coalition and freelancers. 
 RCES  and RCN personal have come to refer to the class as the BUFF class
 (meaning Big Fat F***). There are some rumors of more of the class being
 built on Aubaine and even Aurora. The large  cargo bay can be used to hold
 modules making them a muliti purpose ship. The only thing that is stopping
 the construction of more if this class is the cost and the filling of every
 construction site on Aubaine by Victrixes, Clippers and Frigates, but with
  the growing need the Coalition has for straight heavy haulers the chances
 of  more being constructed
 are getting better. If more are constructed they will probably have a faster
sublight speed.

<h3>Notes</H3>
There are two basic versions:a straight cargo ships version and a version with some passanger carrying capacity.
The cargo version has just one steward and no passanger rooms and 3349kliters cargo space. 
The both cargo holds have life support. The large  double hatches at both ends of the ship
allow easy roll on and off of cargo. The extra power (160Mw) allows
   for machine shops and electronc shops, turning the ship into a mobile repair ship.
