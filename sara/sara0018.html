The <i>Regulator</i> Class System Defense Boats were built and first put into
service at Gresham ( 3138 Diaspora Sector) in 1098. Since then <i>Regulators</i>
have been stationed on numerous worlds throughout the Diaspora, Daibei,
Solomani Rim, Old Expanses and Delphi Sectors. The <i>Regulator</i> is a balanced
combination of offensive punch and defensive toughness. Their offensive
punch come from a combination of its 2,500MJ Particle weapon, its 12 375MJ
lasers and its missile bay with 40 ready missiles. Balancing out its Punch
is its defensive toughness with from 6.4cm of bonded superdense armor, 12
sandcaster turrets, nuclear damper, meson screen and 750 sensor decoys.
There are two less common variants of the <i>Regulator</i>. One replaces the
particle weapon with a 1,000MJ meson gun, while the other does away with the
main weapon altogether making room for additional fuel.

 In general practice
<i>Regulator</i> squadrons are made up of 4 to 8 boats with no more than 1 boat
having a meson gun for it main weapon and the rest having particle weapons.
In areas more distant from the Imperial boarders it not uncommon to find the
additional fuel <i>Regulator</i>s where their longer endurance is more important
than having a main weapon. The 3481st Defense Squadron station at
Scaramouche ( 2509 Solomani Rim Sector) is unusual because all 4 of the
<i>Regulators</i> in the squadron have meson guns. The planet of Neefi ( 2210
Diaspora) received a squadron of additional fuel <i>Regulators</i> shortly after
completing its new class C starport. Unfortunately the First Neefi Defense
Squadron has become know throughout the sector as the Party Squadron. This
is due in some part because of the squadron commander's relaxed leadership
style and the boats being crewed mostly with locals. However, the primary
reason the First Neefi Defense Squadron is know as the Party Squadron is
probably the names of the squadrons 5 boats: the <i>Adams</i>, <i>Foster</i>, <i>Weinhard</i>,
<i>Labatt</i>, and <i>Guinness</i>.<p>
