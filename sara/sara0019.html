Originally design office Aurora Borealis (Vyborg/Solomani Rim) was doing a 
research project about extreme long-range lasers. The project result was a 
x-ray laser, which was capable of 870 000km range. It was also decided, that 
these lasers are mounted on small bay, five lasers in one bay, thus forming 
a battery.
Time went on ,and other things happened. Then one of office's design 
engineers noticed a Imperial Navy call (232-1080) for SDB design. After 
quickly arranged meetings, it was decided to participate the contest, and 
the engineer who had found the call in first place, got the honours to lead 
the project.
The main goals was set as: economical, small, long-range weapons.
A search thorugh office's files was fruitful: x-ray laser battery was found 
from gathering the dust.
The price limit was set to 650MCr, but the ultimate goal of project "Ahven" 
was to be able to build 3 ships at that cost. But, after few weeks of hectic 
working it was clear that target can't be met: those ships would be quite 
inefficient. Still pushing the economical matter, the price was kept down 
during the design process. Finally plans were ready to be introduced to the 
board of office.<p>

Main weapon is the laser battery, mounted on a small bay. Secondary weapons 
are two missile barbettes. On defensive side, two Sand turrets, EM masking, 
a small nuclear screen and small (200 PV) meson screen and 105 Gturns. While 
meson based weapons are devastating at short range, they aren't that 
formitable at longer ranges. With ship's 7G acceleration its standard 
operation prosedure to keep distance from enemy ships. Given meson gun's 
short range, a small screen should be enough to protect the ship.
The battery can be overpowered to 400 shots/turn (-4 diff.) and when used 
with ships excelent communications, they can be remotely operated or given 
target hand-off's from other bases, drones or ships. Missile barbettes are 
offered, but no special missile were developed for the ship, because of lack 
of resources. A subcontractor was considered, but idea was rejected. SS-N-31 
Sparte missiles are recommended, but standard Imperial missiles will fit 
also (200 m^3 missile storage room).
Most of ship's important systems have a backup: AEMS, PEMS, PEMS antenna, 
etc. It was clear that the best possible sensors would be used in this ship 
on the active side. The crew's comfort was thought also: a sickbay was added 
and one large stateroom for traditional recreational use: Sauna.<p>

Overall expression of the ship is: economical enough to be produced in large 
quantities, doesn't rely on expensive missiles for firepower and have good 
active sensors. Fast enough to be able to quickly intercept approaching 
enemy vessels, and fuel to burn.<p>
