The Type M Subsidised Liner was once the staple of the
spaceways. Though not as capacious as proprietary designs of the
larger spacelines, its simplicity and abundant availability made it a
favorite of smaller shipping companies and well heeled free traders.
The concept behind a subsidised ship is fairly easy: in return for a
stipend provided by either larger companies or planetary governments,
the crews or owner/operators of these vessels were contractually
obligated to service a particular trade route. On the mains the
smaller Type R Fat Trader predominated, with the Type M taking cargo
and passenger responsibilities in less dense stellar regions.
<P>
Three main classes existed: The TL-12 <I>Bastien</I>, the TL-13 <I>Bertil</I> and
the TL-15 <I>Stellar</I>, the latter being the most popular and common. The
main external difference between these classes were in the
arrangement of the armament, and the stowage method for the ship's
launch. On the <I>Stellar</I>, the launch is carried in a streamlined
grapple along the ship's spine, while the others carried it in an
internal hangar. The <I>Stellar</I>s were most common in rimward sectors of
the Third Imperium, such as Sol and Diaspora, and in coreward sectors
like Deneb and Corridor, areas where few J-1 mains existed for the
smaller Type R.  The continuing popularity of this class is evident
in the hundreds of unofficial conversions of older Stellars
constructed since the Collapse, from pirate and smuggling vessels to
the White Angel hospital and relief vessels.
<P>

This details the Tukera armed version, which is also operated by
several smaller companies along the Regency Frontier. It is one of
hundreds of potential conversions available commercially or derelict.
This particular vessel, the <I>Horned Owl</I>, was recovered from an
undisclosed part of the Great Rift by Navy Pathfinders in 1162. The
vessel was infected by an early Doomslayer strain, whose mental
instability caused it to jump and strand the vessel in the Rift,
where the virus was successfully disabled by surviving crew and
passengers. The survivors then interred themselves in the vessels
available low berths, where most survived long enough to be rescued
by the Navy. Tukera Type M's are generally named after birds, the
armed models after raptors and birds of prey.
