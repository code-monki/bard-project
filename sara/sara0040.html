 The <I>Fury</I> is part of the complement of a <A HREF="sara5047.html"><I>Nightlord</I> Battle Tender</A>.
 The design was first though of during the years just
 prior to the Rebellion and construct took place before the start of the
 Rebellion though due to the Rebellion causing disruptions it wasn't
 finished until just before the Virus struck. The builders were the
 thrid/last Imperium and it was destined for the Imperial navy, the lack
 of nuclear dampers is due to the designer thinking that the armor would
 stop most hits or that the missiles would be shot down before reaching
 the vessel. There are a couple of house rules which governed these
 decisions, these are that any laser turret can engage a missile if with
 in range with a +2 difficulty modifier and unrefined fuel causes
 increased maintenance (build up of material in pipes etc.). Which is why
 the refining plant is there. The large number of communicators is to
 provide battle redundancy and allow data links/voice comms to be run to
 most of the ships in the squadron at once. The idea is all ships in the
 squadron pass data to tender and a flag staff located there coordinates
 the battle. The sensor are also backed up to off set battle damage as
 are the computers and most of the electronics. The onboard fighter
 squadron has it own fighter controller as part of the command crew of
 the rider.

50-dton missile bay: Four high-speed launch systems for 7 L missiles are
installed in the bay. Each includes a launcher, a mechanical reloader with eleven launch
cradles, and a gunner's workstation equipped with a 300,000 km laser communicator and a 300,000
km MFD with pencil-beam AEMS. The bay also includes a magazine for storing eight
more missiles. The bay contains 56 missiles, of which 48 are loaded to fire; the bay
may fire 40 missiles in any 
turn and can control up to 24 of them. If the bay fires no faster than
16 missiles a turn, it may fire 
continuously until the ship's magazine is exhausted; at 24 per turn it
can fire for two turns, then 
needs to spend one to reload. There are a further 450 in a ready
magazine located near the bay.<P>
