The <I>Passchendaele</I>-Class Transport has it's origins in the 
mists of antiquity. The original design was produced by the 
Terran Confederation from AD 2110 (-2411 Imperial).  The 
<I>Passchendaele</I>-Class was the first of a series of transport 
starships designed and built by the Starbus-Lockheed Consortium 
for the Terran Confederation Navy and commercial interests.  A 
relic <I>Passchendaele</I>-Class (the <I>Meekatharra</I>) was 
discovered in an underground storage facility in 1179 by Medoci 
archeologists.  The facility is believed to part of the orignal 
naval base established by the Terran Confederation during the 
Interstellar Wars.  The <I>Meekatharra</I>, although lacking 
jump drives, served as the pattern craft for the 
<I>Passchendaele</I>-Class.<P>

The class has been built in considerable numbers in the 
Commonwealth.  It's drop tanks allow two jumps totalling three 
parsecs between refuelling stops, giving the transport enough 
'legs' to venture outside the Commonwealth, making it a viable 
Free Trader in this part of the Solomani Rim.<P>

<B>Designer's Notes:</B> I named the ship after a French town, 
Passchendaele (it was the site of a major battle in 1917 in which 
the Australian Infantry Force played a significant role - I 
designed the ship around ANZAC Day last year).<P>

<H4>Notes:</H4>
The large cargo space can accomodate a large variety of payloads.  
Power couplings are available, and the area receives full life 
support. The cargo hatches at the rear of the ship fold open to 
allow roll on-roll off (RO-RO) operations, making vehicle 
disembarkation a simple procedure (The entire bottom rear of the 
ship opens up).
