<FONT SIZE=6><I>Dawn</I>-Class Clipper (Type I & Type II)</FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=2>design by <A HREF="mailto:lewis@chara.gsu.edu">Lewis Roberts</A></FONT><P>

</CENTER>

This is a class of freighters based on the 
<!A HREF="sara####.html"><I>Aurora</I>-Class Clipper</A>. All of the 
<!A HREF="sara####.html">Auroras's</A> weaponry has been removed. 
The subsequent space was filled with fuel, cargo and staterooms. 
The <I>Dawn</I>-Class has enough staterooms for the entire crew 
so it doesn't have to carry a crew module. Standard procedure is 
to carry a ship's boat for emergencies, but not the 
<!A HREF="sara####.html">Aurora's</A> cutter, but the grappel is 
still installed.<P>

<A NAME="HISTORY"><B>HISTORY</B></A><P>
<A HREF="../icis/icis0000.html">Transstar</A> understood as early 
as 1200 that the new RC would produce huge amounts of trade in 
the future. 
<A HREF="../icis/icis0000.html">Transstar's</A> existing fleet of 
relic ships doesn't have the carrying capacity to serve these new 
markets.  
<A HREF="../icis/icis0000.html">Transstar</A> would like to 
purchase new ships, but the RC's shipyards are overtaxed with the 
burden of creating the Aurora family of ships; the original 
<!A HREF="sara####.html"><I>Aurora</I></A>, the 
<!A HREF="sara####.html"><I>Maggart</I></A>, the 
<!A HREF="sara####.html"><I>Lancer</I></A>, the 
<!A HREF="sara####.html"><I>Fussiler</I></A> the 
<A HREF="sara5000.html"><I>Leviathan</I></A>, and the 
<!A HREF="sara####.html"><I>Belladonna</I></A> classes.  All of 
which share common design features and share many parts.  The 
cost of opening up another production line is prohibitive, so 
<A HREF="../icis/icis0000.html">Transstar</A> designed another 
modification of the 
<!A HREF="sara####.html"><I>Aurora</I>-Class</A>. This one would 
be for peacful trade inside of the RC. Originally the designers 
kept the <I>Dawn</I>-Class as a 2G ship, but it was pointed out 
that the ship would be significantly cheaper if it was restricted 
to 1G. The savings would be from the smaller power plant and 
HePLaR chamber required.  Plans for a 2G model were also created, 
in case the RCN wanted to purchase <I>Dawns</I>, for possible use 
as a non-front line ship such as fleet tanker, carrier, battle 
tender or supply ship.<P>

The <I>Dawns</I> and the 
<!A HREF="sara####.htm><I>Aurora</I></A> have the same hull, the 
only exterior difference is that the <I>Dawn</I> doesn't have 
laser turrets, and the muzzle of the Meson gun has been plated 
over.  The interior is slightly different, the staterooms have 
been moved around a bit, and the cargo bay has been enlarged. The 
<!A HREF="sara####.htm><I>Manta</I></A> was replaced by a 
<!A HREF="sara####.htm>400 ton fuel module</A>.  The <I>Dawn</I> 
will be going from starport to starport  where it can purchase 
fuel modules full of refined fuel.  The designers removed the 
<!A HREF="sara####.htm><I>Aurora's</I></A> weapon systems and in 
its place installed more cargo, more fuel and staterooms.<P>

These changes allowed the <I>Dawn</I> to be cheaper, also it 
allows the <I>Dawn</I> to carry 1000 tons of cargo modules.  These 
can easily be mounted and unmounted from the ship, 
<A HREF="../icis/icis0000.html">Transstar</A> can have the cargo 
modules preloaded before the ship arrives in system.  An arriving 
ship will only have to stay insystem long enough, to unhook the 
existing cargo modules, install new modules to peform and any 
maintinence on the jump drives.  Early estimates, suggest that 
this can all be down in 3 days, rather than the normal week. This
will save time and in the shipping business time is money.<P>

As the ships share many components with the <I>Aurora</I> family, 
the price of these parts will come down. Also 
<A HREF="../icis/icis0000.html">Transstar</A> will not have to 
train mechanics, engineers and pilots to operate the equipment. 
They will be able to hire ex-RCN personal, who were trained on 
the other members of the <I>Aurora</I> family.  This will save 
considerable training expense.<P>

Also in times of War the ships can be equipped with missle and 
laser modules, turning it into somewhat of a war ship.  It can be 
equipped with 9 fighter modules allowing it to mount 36 
<!A HREF="sara####.html"><I>Wildbat</I> fighters</A>, allowing to 
fill in as a light carrier.  It could even be equipped with 
<!A HREF="sara####.html"><I>Manticore</I>-Class Battle Riders</A>, 
and be a light Battle Tender.  It will never be a front line unit 
slugging it out with Heavy Cruisers, but can fulfill a useful 
military role.<P>

On 254-1201 Transstar agreed to purchase the first 3 <I>Dawn</I> 
Clippers from 
<!A HREF="../icis/icis####.html">Standard Astronics</A> on 
<!A HREF="../opal/opal####.html">Aubaine</A>.  One of the chief 
inducments to getting into the construction queue was that 
<A HREF="../icis/icis0000.html">Transstar</A> agreed to pay the 
purchase price up front.  This will allow 
<!A HREF="../icis/icis####.html">Standard Astronics</A> to 
construct more slips and expand their construction sites.  
Part of the purchase price was a shipment of refined lanthanum 
that was stranded on 
<!A HREF="../opal/opal####.html">Fija</A>, from before the 
Collapse.  To raise additional funds, 
<A HREF="../icis/icis0000.html">Transstar</A> offered bonds 
secured by its fleet of relic starships.  This was an early test 
of the fledgling RC markets and the optimism of RC investors.  It 
was also the largest private bond offering in the Old Expanses in 
70 years.  The enthusiasm of investors was furthered by the many 
public statements of 
<A HREF="../icis/icis0000.html">Transstar</A> board members that 
they intended to buy back the bonds over the course of their 
lifetime as funds became available.  This reassured investors 
that the bonds would continue to be tradeable at a good price.  
The purchase of the <I>Dawn</I>-Class Clippers has strained 
<A HREF="../icis/icis0000.html">Transstar's</A> budget, reducing 
the amount of capital that is available for aquisition of other 
assets, but in the long run the Clippers should make a healthy 
profit.<P>

<A HREF="../icis/icis0000.html">Transstar's</A> first <I>Dawn</I> 
clipper will be named for 
<!A HREF="../dani/dani####.html">Kether Friedman</A>, captain of the 
<A HREF="sara7001.html"><I>Hokka</I></A> who died when it was temporarily 
lost during the collapse. Subsequent <I>Dawn</I> Clippers and other 
ships 
<A HREF="../icis/icis0000.html">Transstar</A> buys will be named 
for other people who gave their lives in the service of the Dawn 
League or the Coalition. The first <I>Dawn</I> Clipper should have 
its maiden voyage in mid 1203.<P>
