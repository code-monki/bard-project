The <I>Admiral</I> is essentially a Light Cruiser without a jump drive. Optimised
for combat and carried into battle by specialist tenders, the <I>Admirals</I> pack a lot of combat power into a 25,000 ton chassis. We are not given much information on the history or background of the class in Battle Rider, but from the TL and the fact that they are carried by <I>Cleon</I>-class Battle Tenders, I assume they are the work of the early Third Imperium.

The ship has a notable double-spinal armament, combining a 40-GJ Spinal PAW capable of dealing 1000 damage at 80 hexes with a 30-GJ Meson Gun capable of shredding practically any sized ship up close. These are backed up by a heavy missile bay, a number of heavy laser barbettes and a plethora of light defensive turrets. Additional defence is provided by a handful of nuclear dampers, an obscene number of sandcasters and a very large meson screen (toned down to make it actually fit in the ship).<P>

I have had to guess quite a lot of the detail, as anyone who has converted
BR-TNE will understand. In order to allow the vessel to operate away from a
tender for extended periods as a Heavy SDB, I have included reasonable
support facilities, relatively luxurious crew quarters and a moderate cargo
bay. The 100-ton hangar may also be used to carry two Modular Cutters, one
Cutter with space for easy repair, one Shuttle or one <I>Sulemain</I>-Class
Scout/Courier for use as a courier when on SDB/picket duty.<P>

Sensors and comms are heavily backed up for redundancy, with the exception
of the Meson Comm and the Densitomoter, both felt to be luxuries that the
ship can afford to be without in a pinch. The (seemingly huge) number of
MFDs was calculated from BR guidelines, where one MFD is allocated for each
spinal weapon, plus one per two laser mounts, plus the number of missile
directors stated on the BR counter.<P>

Finally, I was quite pleasantly surprised that there was enough space left
over to include Emergency Low Berths; a feature I'm sure the crew will
appreciate.  I did consider lifeboats, but they require a phenomenal amount of space.<P>

Operates in squadrons of six <I>Admiral</I>-Class Battle Riders plus one <I>Cleon</I>-Class Battle Tender (300,000 dt)<P>

This design was converted from the data given in Battle Rider. The only
variation from the given data is the reduction of the Meson Screen from 2000 to 1000, since the limits of surface area make it impossible to fit a larger screen onto the hull. All other aspects of the design have been adhered to.<P>
