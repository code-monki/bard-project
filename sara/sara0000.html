The <I>Thresher</I>-Class SDB is produced by
<!A HREF="../icis/icis####.html">Bourgund Shipyards</A>
on
<!A HREF="../opal/opal####.html">Oriflamme</A>.
<!A HREF="../opal/opal####.html">Oriflamme</A> possesses the
largest shipyard in the RC, but it is, as yet, unable to
manufacture jump drives. To utilize the excess capacity, the
Technarchs have ordered large numbers of SDBs. This serves
several purposes. First, it puts tens of thousands of workers
to work.  When the shipyard does start to manufacture jump
drives, these workers will be highly trained, and will be able
to produce large numbers of ships for the growing markets.  A
second purpose behind the expansion, is that
<!A HREF="../opal/opal####.html">Oriflamme</A> needs a large
navy, both to patrol the new merchant traffic and to protect
against Vampire incursions.<P>

The Technarchs also want to export SDBs to other planets, both
inside and outside of the RC.  Only
<!A HREF="../opal/opal####.html">Aurora</A> and
<!A HREF="../opal/opal####.html">Aubaine</A> are able to
produce ships for their own defense. The
<!A HREF="../opal/opal####.html">Aubaine</A> shipyards are busy
producing jump capable ships, and have long waiting lists.
Some might question the sanity of selling warships to planets
in the Wilds.  It is actually a very good idea, SDBs are not
usable for offensive purposes, no one will be able to conquor
their neighbor with a fleet of SDBs, they will be able to
protect their planet against Vampires, pirates, and marauders.
This will help promotethe development of these planets, and
increase trade between the RC and the Wilds, eventually
leading to the expansion of the RC.<P>

The <I>Thresher</I>-Class is built primarily for
<!A HREF="../opal/opal####.html">Oriflamme</A> use, it is
fairly expensive, costing just over 1 Gigacredit.  The
difference in exchange rates between
<!A HREF="../opal/opal####.html">Oriflamme</A> and
<!A HREF="../opal/opal####.html">Aurora</A>/
<!A HREF="../opal/opal####.html">Aubaine</A> makes it a little
more reasonably priced, (about 24%) but still expensive.  The
<A HREF="sara0001.html"><I>Hobnail</I>-Class</A> and the
<A HREF="sara0003.html"><I>Cutlass</I>-Class</A> are more
suitibly priced for export.<P>

The <I>Thresher</I>-Class is capable of 3G acceleration,
this is extremly high for a ship without gravitic compensation.
The crew is protected by workstations and grav tanks. This
allows 3Gs of acceleration to be ignored. All crewmembers also
have neural jacks installed, which allow another diff mod to
be ignored.  So the ship can evade at 3Gs and the crew suffers no penalty. Crew members without workstations, notably the maintenance staff and ship's troops are restricted to quarters while the ship undergoes high g manuvers.  This makes damage control rather difficult, but high G manuvers are
performed infrequently, and only during combat situations.<P>


The <I>Thresher</I>-Class is a sphere with two hamster wheels
attached to the sides. These allow the crew to sleep and
recreate in normal gravity. The Captain and
XO have a single, while the other officers double up in small staterooms. The crew sleeps in two large barracks,
but they do not have the standard bunks, but rather hammocks,
which can also be used in zero g situtations when the hamster
wheels are not not funcioning.  The ship design is very cramped,
and all crew members are carefully screened to eliminate those
who have psychological problems problems with this.  The
<!A HREF="../opal/opal####.html">Oriflamme</A> navy maintains a
very high morale, by offering signing bonuses, extra shore
leave, and providing very high quality food.  Also there is a
mystique about the navy, which assures that there will always
be qualified applicants.<P>

The ship is streamlined, but the fusion rockets prevent it from landing on an inhabited planet.  The radioactive wasted produced by the rockets would do irrereable harm to the biosphere.  The Archangel is built in orbit and the only time it enters a planetary astmosphere is to refuel in a gas giant's atmosphere.  None of Oriflamme's gas giants have an native life forms, so the radioactivity does little harm.  <P>
