This ship was submitted to the Traveller Mailing List THUDDD competition.
The contest was to design a SDB to help small pocket empires fend off
the Third Imperium in the first years of the Imperial Era. It is
very suited to being used as a ship for a pocket empire in the New Era
as well.<p>

If the AE is forced into a fight with the Imperium, it will lose.  There
is no way that one small world can hope to defeat the combined might of 
hundreds of worlds with higher tech level weapons and ships.  If the AE
is to survive it has to make the possibilty of a fight with the Imperium,
so costly that the Imperium will choose to ignore the AE and go find someone
weaker to pick on.  <P>

Initial intelligence suggests that Imperial forces consist of 10,000
to 25,000 ton ships escorted by the highly tauted Imperial Fighters.
While Imperial Fighters do cost significant amounts, to discourage
Imperial attack, their capital ships have to be in danger. The <I>Archer</i>
SDB was developed to do this.<P>

The <I>Archer</i> was given 5 of the biggest laser cannons, that the AE can
build, to save money these lasers were made to be non-steerable.  These
lasers are over 8meters in diameter and fire 100 500Mj laser pulses per
half hour. (in game terms ROF=100)   These lasers are controlled by a
state of the art Master Fire Director.  Only one MFD was chosen, both
because MFDs are very expensive and also the tatic behind the <I>Archer</i> is
for it to close with the enemy and to concentrate all of its firepower
on the capital ships of the enemy fleet.  Fighters and escorts will
be ignored until the capital ships are destroyed.  To protect the <I>Archer</i>
against the fire from the Fighters, the ship was given a thick armored
hull, it was also given 7 sandcaster turrets. These sandcasters can
protect the ship against the laser stings of fighters, as well as the
capital ship's PAW spinal mounts.  In addition 5 point defense lasers are
mounted, these can shoot down incoming missiles, and any fighters that are
in range. Also 200 AEMS decoys and 200 PEMS decoys are installed, these
can reduce the chance of a sensor lock on by a hostile craft.  EMM
was looked at but the 70 MCr price tag was thought to be too expensive.<P>

The Laser cannon of the <I>Archer</i>'s should outrange many of the weapons, found
on Imperial ships.  (The TL-12 Meson guns found in Starships only range
up to 40 hexes, while the <I>Archer</i>'s laser ranges out to 80 hexes. The
typical turret laser, while being able to reach 80 hexes, will be unable
to penetrate the <I>Archer</i>'s armor plating at those ranges.) <P>

While the laser lances of the <I>Archer</i> are a powerful weapon, the <I>Archer</i>
is two tech levels behind that of their Imperial foes.  This does
effect the design, the <I>Archer</i> can only accelerate at 1G, this will allow
the Imperial forces to dictate the range at which the combat is fought.
While this is unfortunate, it is not fatal, because of the long range of
the <I>Archer</i>'s laser lance.<P>

Many weapon systems were looked at while desiging the <I>Archer</i>.  The
three major weapon systems are spinal PAWS, missile bays and large lasers.
Missiles are the most effective weapon at TL-10, but they are extremly
expensive.  A 1000 ship can easily carry 100-200 ton missile bay capable of
firing a huge missile volley.  Missile bays are very cheap, but missiles
require a MFD for each 3 missiles fire, as each MFD costs about 50
MCr the price for the ship would sky rocket.  Adding still more expense
the missiles cost just under a million credits each.  As the AE
desires an effective yet inexpensive ship, missiles were not selected.
It was feld that large laser lances can do more damage, with better
penetration than PAWS, so linked laser lances were selected.  <P>

The ship is egg shaped, the laser lances are mounted around the pointed 
end of the egg, while the HEPlaR engines point out the fat end of the egg.
The sandcasters and point defense lasers are mounted evenly around 
the middle of the egg. Most of the fuel, is mounted directly behind
the armor, to act as extra protection.  The bridge and engineroom are
located in the center of the ship. It was felt that the most essential
systems should be put behind as many barriers as possible. <P>
