<P>
The <I>Khugelikaer</I> is an older destroyer
blooded in the last two frontier wars against Zhodani
and Vargr raiders. The class does not carry a spinal
mount, and its weaponry is rather light for its size.
Prior to the Imperial Civil War it was the most
important class of destroyer in terms of numbers. Each
Imperial fleet had at least a couple of DesRons
consisting of these vessels, and its long range made
it much sought after craft by the various factional
leaders.
<P>
Equipped with a J-5 drive and capable of 6-G
acceleration, this ship represents the maximum that
can be acheived at TL-15 in terms of performance. As a
result of this emphasis upon mobility, the ship has
little free space, and tight internal quarters prevent
the deployment of heavier weaponry or carried craft.
The ship's main armament is two 2500 MJ parallel
N-PAWs that carry sufficient range to hit targets out
to 2.5 million kilometers, but whose light firepower
prevents engagement against heavier capital level
craft. Traditionally the "Kooge" is deployed as a
space defense craft, protecting larger units from
fighters, small nuisance craft and missles, though its
laser output tends to limit it in the latter role.
Unfortunately it lacks for magazine and cargo space,
requiring to accompanied by additional resupply
vessels on most of its missions.
<P>
 The ship is a blunt nosed missle like
craft similiar in appearance to the old <I>Gazelle</I> class.
Although its configuration says otherwise, the vessel
looks very stubby in appearance, and lacks any
external protuberances such as wings or other
aerodynamic surfaces. The hull itself has a straight
taper to about thirty meters from the aft end, where
it bulges out into a rounded section holding the
drives and powerplant. The twin parallel mounts are
mounted in the lower hull, with two gun ports, one on
each side, set back about twenty meters from the tip
of the bow.
<P>
Internally the ship mounts a large gundeck behind the
bridge that houses the main fire control and energy
systems for the twin parallel mounts. The section
below this is shielded by two large fuel tanks that
also provide cryogenic cooling for the N-PAW power
coils. Crew quarters are constructed in a ring to aft,
surrounding the main cargo bay, which is also accessed
by a freight elevator further aft.
<P>
The <I>Khugelikaer</I> was a very common
antebellum design, and almost every Imperial fleet had
at least one DesRon equipped for convoy escort and
commerce protection. In Regency service the class is
still found with every fleet, save the 74th and 128th,
whose patrol area in the Great Rift is not suitable
for these vessels. Despite its long jump range, the
limited reaction mass of these vessels make them more
suited for short range patrol than for long range
strike, as the excess jump fuel is better used for
loitering patrols. In Vampire Fleets, the "Kooge" has
been perhaps the most commonly encountered Imperial
Navy destroyer.
<P>
This vessel is based upon the CT design by Daniel
Ward, which may be found at
