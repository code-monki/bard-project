During the time after recontact with the Hivers, the Aubaini government put a major effort into building system defenses in case of a Vampire attack.  This effort continued into 1200, and ended with the founding of the Reformation Coalition.  The RC needed more jump capable ships, both military and exploratory.  The Aubaine governmet put off building more system defense boats for itself, but it still builds SDBs for other governments in the Coalition, who have no defenses against attack. <P>

During the period from 1194 to 1200, 5 <I>Chimera</i> Missile Defense Boats were built, they all serve in the Aubaine navy, patrolling the system.  The <I>Chimera</i> is primarily designed to protect a crucial world in the system, either a gas giant, or the main world itself.  While patrolling a gas giant, the <I>Chimera</i> is designed to hide deep in the gas giant.  To counter the tremendous pressures of the gas giant, the hull is stressed to 10Gs. When at these depths, the ship will be out of communcation range, due to the opacity of the atmosphere. It is thought that the ship will only enter extreme depths after expending its missile capacity, or repairing battle damage.   This also protects the boat when it is hiding in a world's ocean.  Other less expensive ships, such as <I>Dragon</I>, <I>Griffen</I>, <I>Manticore</I> or <I>Medusa</I> SDBs patrol higher regions of the gas giant, and its moons.  These ships and automated sensor buoys act as lookouts for enemy ships.  Once an enemy ship is spotted, a judgment is made whether it is a significant threat, or just a feint by a larger enemy taskforce to expose the Chimera's. If the threat is judged significant, the <I>Chimera</i> rises and unleashes several volleys of missiles.  The ship may also pre-deploy missiles in orbit around the planet, either hidden in ring systems, or just in the opening, hopeing that the missiles will be lost in the general sensor noise that gas giant emmit. This gives the <I>Chimera</i> extra missile capacity.  While the <I>Chimera</i> is firing off its volleys, it will undoubtably be coming under intense enemy fire, to help ward this off, the ship is equiped with 10 95 Mj laser turrets to shoot down enemy missiles, 5 sandcasters to help defend against beam weapons and missiles which get through the point defenses.  In case of a high tech enemy with a meson gun, the ship is equipped with a large meson screen. It is also heavily armored.  <P>

The ship only accelerates at 1G, most of the time the ship will by lying in wait for enemy ships.  Extra acceleration would allow the ship to evade enemy fire, but it was thought extra fire power was a better use of space.
If the ship is forced to enter extreme depths, where its 1G acceleration may not be able to get it out, its fuel tanks have been specially modified to be configurable as ballast tanks, allowing the ship to come out of extreme depths.  This also allows the ship to save itself if it suffers a manuver drive hit, and it is slowly falling into the gas giant.  The ship only has 36 G-turns or refined fuel, but it can fill its entire fuel tank in under 9 minutes. As it will normally be operating in a gas giant, scooping up additional fuel while on the run, should be no problem.  In an emergency, unrefined fuel can be used in a HEPlaR system.  <P>

The Aubaine Navy tends not to station ships in the oceans of Aubaine, because the noise of the HEPlaR jets, disrupts Schalli communication.  In extreme need the ships are authorized to venture into the oceans.  In case this does happens, the ships have a cargo hatch on the floor of the main cargo bay, this will allow the ship to take on cargo while under water. Once the door is opened, air pressure will keep the water from coming in, it will act as a bathescape. The cargo bay also can be pressurized independently of the rest of the ship, this allows Schalli to enter and exit the cargo bay, without suffering decompression effects.  <P>
