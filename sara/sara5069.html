"The first <I>Aganar</I> class light cruiser was built by the Imperial Glisten
Navy in 997. The last of the sixty vessels was commissioned in
1029. The ships are named for famous battles of history. At the
outbreak of the Fifth Frontier War, the <I>Aganar</I>s were the oldest
class of vessels still in service with the IGN, and were committed
to action immediately as one of the few meson gun carrier classes
in use. Merely the technological equals of their opponents in the
Collace Independence Fleet, and heavily outnumbered at every
encounter due to the vagaries of their pre-war deployment, the
<I>Aganar</I> squadrons were virtually annihilated in the opening weeks
of the war. Between combat losses and the destruction of a
number of damaged ships under repair during the brief Collace
occupation of Glisten, only a single ship out of the sixty, the IGNS
<I>Alesia</I>, survived through the end of the war. The <I>Alesia</I> was
reclassified as a fleet escort during the fleet reorganization of 1112,
and was still in service as a training vessel as of 1118."<BR>

<P>
This is a FF&S reworking of a design by R.S. Dean
(<a href="http://www.solstation.com/core/deanfile/SHIP0258.HTM">MegaTraveller Design</A>).  The MT
version had a ludicrously short endurance of < 2 weeks (or 3
days in combat); this version isn't nearly as tight, but still
manages to mount a useful sized meson gun.
<P>
The best description of the <I>Aganar</I>-class is "an eggshell armed
with a hammer".  While its main armament can swat smaller
escorts and pose a threat to some larger vessels, the <I>Aganar</I> has
thin armour and is vulnerable to attacks by PAWs.  Because of
this, it is probably best utilised as a raider rather than in stand-up
fleet actions.
<P>
Except for a handful of officers, the entire crew is accomodated at
double-occupancy.  A minimal hanger is installed, and a 40-DspT
Pinnace serves as a general utility vehicle.
