The Sojourner is KeeEEka Strongwall's entry into the Coalition's competition
for a new Wilds Trader.  It is the first ship designed by the shipyard, and 
if it is choosen, the shipyard hopes that it will be just the first in a 
long line of Schalli designed and built ships. While it is built by Schalli,
it is designed for use by humans.  <P>

TeeCLEEEoo Blackfin, the chief designer of the Sojourner, designed the ship
to succeed in the unique situtation that the Wilds present.  The ship is
heavily armored, not so much for space battles, but in case a
local planetary leader tries to steal the ship. The <I>Jayhawk</I> Far Trader
is so lightly armored, that it barely protects against small 
arms fire. The Sojourner's hull is five times as thick and is capable of
withstanding light anti-tank weapons, grenade launchers, anti-aircraft guns,
mortars, recoiless rifles and some artillery pieces.  The ship also is 
capable of protecting itself.  It has a belly turret with four VRF gauss
guns mounted in it,  each gun has 60,000 rounds of ammunition in the turret.
The VRF Gauss guns are built on Fija, and are standard RC issue, which is
also compatable with relic Imperial models. This will make it easier
to acquire spare parts if an break down occurs. An autocannon was 
contemplated, but in the Wilds it might be hard to aquire additional
ammunition.  Standard dart ammunition can be manufactured in the
Sojourner's machine shop.  The ship also mounts a standard Tl-12 120 Mj
laser turret. The turret is capable of firing a shot every 18 seconds 
(4 combat rounds) if used in ground combat.  It also has a standard 
sandcaster, capable of protecting the ship against hostile Vampire and 
pirate ships. Its sensor's are also much improved from those in the
<I>Jayhawk</I>.  In the Wilds, it is essential to know if potential enemies
are laying about.<P>

The ship has a 12 ton vehicle bay and comes with a standard TL-8 Tracked 
ATV.  These ATV's are built on Lucifer, and imported to Aubaine. For a small
upgrade fee, the ATV can be upgraded to a wheeled ATV, or even an airraft.
The Sojourner has state of the art TL-12 machine shop, and electronic shop.
These shops have a dual use; they can replace many of the minor parts on the
ship in case of a malfunction. They can also be used to repair relic 
technology on Wilds worlds.  This way the ship can earn additional revunue
between jumps, either by acting as a mobile fix-it shop, or by buying 
broken equipment, repairing it and then selling it to someone else.
The shops come with a extensive library of parts and equipment
that can be built with the available tools. This will also help rebuild
the wilds worlds, so that they will be in better shape when the RC contacts
them.  <P>

The Sojourner provides ample means for a Captain to make a profit, it has
20 staterooms, usually nine of these go to the crew, but individual captains
can decide to double up crew members to provide more space for passengers.
It can also carry 89 tons of cargo, which is almost double that of the 
<I>Jayhawk</I> Far Trader.  This should provide enough space, that the owners
will have no problem paying off their mortgages.  An exact economical plan
can't be worked out because most Free Traders will be buying cargo on 
speculation, and the exact profit/loss ratio  can't be worked out in advance.<P>
 
The ship has a fairly simple appearence.  It is a smooth box, with a 
rounded nose, a HEPlaR thruster is mounted on either side of the ship
at the rear.  The quad-gauss gun is mounted in a belly turret, under the 
nose of the ship.  The sandcaster turret is also a belly turret located
mid-ships, while the laser turret is located directly above this on the
top of the ship.  Access to the cargo bay and ATV bay is from the rear,
via a roll down ramp.  When on the ground the ship rests on four landing
feet, during flight these fold up into the hull.  <P>

Inside the ship is fairly simple.  The ship is laid out with two levels,
the top deck, contains the cockpit, crew and passenger lounge, staterooms 
and jump drive. Fuel for the jump drives and HEPlaR drives is located in 
several compartments in the bottom deck. The fuel is compartmentalized to
minimize losses in case of battle damage.  Most of the cargo bay is 
located on the bottom deck, but at the rear of the ship it exapands into
the top deck, to allow the storage of taller cargos.  The ATV is also
stored on the bottom deck, at the rear of the ship. <P> 

Staterooms are fairly spartan, and lack many of the high tech features
that are common in some ships, such as holographic projection screens,
variable form furniture etc.  It was thought that these items didn't improve
the functunality of the ship, and would be rather difficult to maintain
in the Wilds.  Each Sojourner does come with an extensive collection of
technical manuals and informational holovids, in addition to many 
entertainment videos.  The passenger's lounge holovid unit, can be dismounted
and used to display videos on remote locations.  It was thought that some
crews might want to show  videos to residents of the Wild. This could be
either as entertainment or as a training seminar.  It should be noted
that the library collection was choosen to put the best face possible on the
Coalition. <P>
