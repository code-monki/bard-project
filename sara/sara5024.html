The <I>Cross of Iron</I>-class Vampire Hunter was designed to respond quickly and
decisively to threats to Regency colonial interests on the trailing fringe.
After the Singing Sword incident at the Seplus/Corridor colony, it was
determined that in order for our colonial efforts to be successful, the
appearance of a reasonably safe frontier must be maintained. The Regent
himself, Caranda Aledon-Alkhalikoi, signed a historic amendment to the
colonial budget for the construction of 100,000 tonnes of shipping designed
for the express purpose of hunting down Vampire ships on the trailing
fringe.<P>

The Regency Quarantine Service (RQS) procurement division, which is
responsible for the administration of the Vampire Hunter program,
determined that it would be best to have 50 relatively small strike
cruisers, so that all of the colonial hubs could be protected at once.
Thus, the <I>Cross of Iron</I> was born.<P>

Designed by Persephone Industries of Starn/Inar (Deneb: 1417 A000996-F),
the <I>Cross of Iron</I> is designed to handle threats large and small. Its laser
turrets and barbettes are effective in the destruction of small- to
medium-sized ships as well as point defense against missile fire. Though
missiles are rare on Vampire ships, the <I>Cross of Iron</I> can also employ its
nuclear damper to shut down the rare missile. Against larger ships, the
<I>Cross of Iron</I> employs its six missile barbettes and meson gun. Though the
meson gun is only effective at shorter ranges, it was deemed a necessary
add-on due to its ability to quickly and decisively eliminate smaller
opponents while the ship may be simultaneously engaged battling larger
craft.<P>

Ideally, three to eight <I>Cross of Iron</I>s are deployed per colonial system
with the larger population settlements receiving the larger squadrons. The
ship's medium jump capability is intended to enable it to rapidly deploy to
systems that require immediate security or are besieged by known Vampire
threats.<P>

Command crews for the <I>Cross of Iron</I> will be drawn from the RQS. The
remainder of the crew will be drawn from the RQS for the skilled positions
and colonial recruits for support positions. It was determined that
colonial recruits, while often somewhat raw, will be highly motivated since
they are defending their new homes.<P>
