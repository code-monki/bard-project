<p>
The <i>Maverick</I> Destroyer's primary mission is to hunt down and destroy 
Vampires, but the designers wanted a ship that was also capable of 
performing a wide variety of tasks in the Wilds.  The Regency Navy
expect the ship to help out Regency colonies in the event of attacks
by Corsairs, pirates, ripper gangs or hostile Pocket Empires.  
The Captains have orders to provide assitance to Regency colonies,
as long as it does not detract from their primary mission of destroying
any and all Virus and Vampire infestations.  It is also hoped that
the Virus threat will be defeated in the next few decades and that 
the <i>Maverick</I> would become take up many of the tasks of a standard destroyer.
<p>
The ship is a 5000 ton needle hull, the needle was choosen to allow
the largest possible spinal mount.  A Meson gun was initially looked at,
but it was felt that a 131 meter meson gun was fairly useless, so a
spinal paw was choosen.  While missiles are an extremly useful weapon,
with incrediable damage potential, they are less useful for a ship
which is expected to be away from port for months at a time, with
multiple engagements.  Rather than running the risk of running out
of missiles, lasers were choosen to be the secondary weapon of the 
<i>Maverick</I>.  The ship is constructed at TL-15, with the exception of
the decoys, computers and other control systems.  TL-16 comptuers 
were choosen, both to decrease the number of crew and to provide
additional protection against virus infection.  While a TL-16
ship would probably be more effective, it was thought that the limited
TL-16 capacity should be used to defend the main worlds of the Regency
rather than sending them beyond the Regency border.  It is expected
that the <i>Maverick</I> would be built in any of the many TL-15 worlds with
class A starports in Deneb or Reft sectors.  This will put the
newly constructed ships close to their destination, and speed up
deployment.  
<p>
The <i>Maverick</I> is expected to operate alone for much of its tour of duty,
several ships will be assigned to a subsector, they will slowly work their
way through a subsector, cleansing it of virus nests.  The ships will
rendevous every few months, to inform each other of their progress and
to coordinate intelligence in case of large scale Vampire organizations.
If one of the ships fails to make a rendevous, the other ships will
investigate, as it is most likely that the ship came up against a 
a force too big to handle.  If the ships encounter a enemy too powerful
to destroy they will try to either head back to friendly territory for
reinforcements if the enemy is jump capable, or leave it for later 
mop up operations by a naval taskforce.  
<p>
While it is expected that the ship's main enemy will be Virus infected
starships, the <i>Maverick</I> is also capable of destroying Virus infected
targets on the ground.  The <i>Maverick</I>'s many lasers are capable of 
doing damage to ground based targets from orbit. The ship
can also enter the atmosphere for very close in work, though this will
increase the risk to the ship.  Further more the ship carries a compliment
of 50 marines specially trained in the destruction of virus infected
systems.  The <i>Maverick</I> carries up to 50 tons of armored vehicles for
the Marines to use.  The exact make up of the vehicle is left up to
the indivdual marine commander, but it is expected to consist of several
Norris Grav Tanks and a few Astrin grav carriers.  These vehicles
are all equipped with tactical nuclear weapons, and a wide variety of
conventional weapons.  It is expected that they can take care of isolated
Virus infestations, such as a starport, automated factory, etc.  If an
entire planet is infested, they will need more manpower. The ship will
attempt to destroy any space going capabilities and leave the rest for
a latter mop up operation.  
 <p>
The <i>Maverick</I> is equiped with a 5000 MJ PAW, this will cripple most small
civilian ships with a single shot.  It will also do damage to many
larger warships.  The PAW is also backed up with 30 non-grav focused
lasers, and 18 grav focused lasers.  The non-grav focused lasers allow
the ship to inflict horrific amounts of damage at short range, while
the non grav focused lasers allow the ship to inflict damage at longer
range, in case an opponent has manged to stay at long range.  Each of
these weapons is grouped in three bays each. 
The ship also carries 10 light turrets of  50 MW lasers, these are intended
for point defense use against incoming missiles , but 
can actually score minor wounds againt small combatants such as small
craft and light merchants ships. The Grav-focused lasers
are installed in the standard 50 ton bay, but the non-grav lasers
are in custom 34 ton bays. The nonstandard bays were used because
the use of non-grav focused lasers is a fairly non standard tactic,
and they don't fit very well in the standard bay.  Non-grav lasers
require much larger focal arrays and they tend fill up the surface
area of a bay long before they fill up the volume of the bay.
The point defense lasers are also installed in non-standard turrets,
the standard TL-15 laser turret is 210 Mj while these could have
been installed, not as many could be installed.
<p>
The ship does not ignore defense, the ship is equipped with the 
afore mentioned point defense lasers, and also 10 sandcasters, 
a moderatly thick armored hull and a large 500 point value meson
screen, capable of protecting against many of the large meson guns
that capital ships use.  State of the art TL-16 decoys were installed,
and the use of TL-16 decoys should prove most useful against many of
the TL-15 ships that will be inhabitig the wilds. It also has ample 
acceleration to allow it to put several Gs into evasion. It also
has EMM, 3 long range AEMS jammers, and a area jammer capable of
jamming over a long distance. This was thought most useful if a
fleet of vampire ships was engaged, this would hopefully
disrupt communcations between the ship. 
<p>
In addition to the standard weapons of war, the <i>Maverick</I> is equipped
with two labortories dedicated to studying Virus in all of its forms.
These labs are each equipped with a TL-16 computer. These computers
are equipped with all possible knowledge of Virus. They have records
of all recorded Vampire engagments, including the classified ones.
The labortories are staffed by 5 virus specialists.  These specialists
are expected to provide useful suggestions on virus strategy and
to study any virus that is encountered to better defend the Regency.
<p>
The ship has many of the normal features of a Regency destroyer,
it is capable of 6 Gs of acceleration, the trade off for this is that
the ship only is capable of Jump-3, it was thought that extra acceleration
was more useful in a fight, that the ship will be in a great deal of action.
The large size of the ship allows it to mount rendudant sensors, which
should be useful in the long tours of duty the ship is expected to perform.
The ship has a machine shop and a electronics shop to repair any
battle damage.  It has a 100 minimal hanager which is intended for
a shuttle, but if warrented a scout courier could be used.<p>

Both the ship and the weapons were designed with Antti Lahtinen's 
wonderful spreadsheets.<p>
