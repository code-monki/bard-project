 Ongoing operations at Korinall Fleet Yards continue to reap rich rewards for the
 people of the <a href="../bardperi.html">Korinall Cluster</A>. 
 <P>
 STREA announces the successful recovery of an Ex-Navy Assault ship, the ISS
 <I>General Sir Michael Rose</I>. A three-week board, capture and make-safe operation
 was
 completed last Sunday by STREA engineers and marines, operating alongside CERCES
 computer-empaths. While the <I>Michael Rose</I> herself is no longer jump-capable,
 shuttles are already bringing back relic equipment from on board, including four
 small craft constructed at the Imperial state-of-the-art.
 <P>
 It is hoped that at some time in the future, it will be possible to construct a
 jump frame of sufficient size to transport the ship to a Cluster mainworld.

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</B><BR>
 <P>
 At 11:45 this morning the Assembly passed a bill authorising a Request To Tender
 to convert the four <I>Rhino</I> class dropships recovered from the ISS  
 <I>General Sir Michael Rose</I> last month into long-range jump capable scout vessels. AnraTech,
 Moorsyth Design Yards and Cluster Munitions are all expected to submit bids for
 this lucrative contract.
 <P>
 The four craft, each displacing fifty tons, were constructed with cutting edge
 Imperial technology shortly before Collapse. Highly manoevrable and heavily
 armed,
 many analysts expressed surprise that STREA was content to allow them released
 for
 an ostensibly non-military purpose. 
 <P>
 Jaglom Pulver, defence correspondant for Capital Citizen, said "While this
 decision has surprised many, I'd bet my grandmother STREA won't let go of those
 boats' ECM suites."
 <P>
 Time will tell.

 <P><HR><P>
 
 Moorsyth Design Yards Presents: The <I><I>Rhino Hunter</I></I>-Class Extended-Range Scout
 Ship.
 <P>
 The ship comprises 21.71 MCr of TL-15 relic components (recovered from Korinall
 Fleet Yards) and 45.65 MCr of TL-9/11 components.
 <P>
 Four ships of the class may be built with the four recovered <I>Rhinos</I> (86.84 MCr),
 which will cost an additional 182.60 MCr in TL-11 locally-produced components.
 We
 can save 46 MCr by cannibalising the fusion rockets from the recently retired
 <I>Crossbow</I> (www.nickb.ndirect.co.uk/tneships/SDB_Cros.html) KCS <I>Mangonel</I>. (A
 <I>Crossbow</I> SDB uses 6x3500 kN fusion rockets, allowing one per jump frame and two
 spare units to allow for Upkeep-by-Exchange.)
 <P>
 <h3>Overview</h3>
 <P>
 The <I>Rhino Hunter</I> scout is a 100-ton ship constructed from a relic TL-15 <I>Rhino</I>
 class Dropship (http://www.nickb.ndirect.co.uk/tneships/ST_Rhino.html) grappled
 to  a 50-ton jump frame constructed at TL-11. While the combination is
 unstreamlined,
 the two halves are capable of seperation in order to allow fuel scooping or
 planetary landings.
 <P>
 Upon docking, the jump frame's airlock aligns with the <I>Rhino</I>'s tail lock,
 allowing
 through passage between the two ships. Data systems and ship's services are also
 shared. The combined vessel is controlled from the jump frame's flight deck,
 which  has a redundant pilot's station to allow manoevre while plotting jump when two
 pilots are aboard.
 <P>
 Docked, the vessel is capable of 3G and jump-2, with each G-turn requiring 8.9
 m<sup>3</sUP>  of LH2. Both HEPlaR and Fusion rocket drives were considered for the Jump Frame,
 but the more expensive fusion rocket was eventually settled on, partly to offer
 a  cross-system 'trek home' capability and partly since fusion is a much more
 reliably proven technology than HEPlaR. The Fusion drive offers a back-up for
 the  HEPlaR drive, as well as for the fusion reactor. The fusion drive can power life
 support for something like eight months if jump fuel is available to burn.
 <P>
 Runing purely off the Jump Frame's fusion rocket, the combination can accelerate
 at 0.25G constantly for 319 days (a delta vee of 0.25c, ignoring relativistic
 effects). In the event of a broken jump drive, the craft can comfortably cross
 intra-system distances to reach a habitable zone.
 <P>
 The ship also carries a variety of missiles and a manually controlled PD laser,
 as  well as a high powered plasma gun (normally fired from the <I>Rhino</I>'s engineering
 station) should anything stray into spitting distance. 
 <P>
 Seperated, the <I>Rhino</I> is capable of 5.7G. The jump frame is restricted to a
 rather  more sedate 0.5G but carries between 100 and 950 G-hours of reaction mass for
 its
 fusion rocket.
 <P>
 <h3>Missions</h3> 
 <P>
 The <I>Rhino Hunter</I> is an extremely versatile ship, capable of a wide range of
 missions. Its capacity to split into two totally independant craft increases
 that
 versatility in ways other designs cannot hope to duplicate.
 <P>
 <B>Initial Survey</B> - while the sensor fit would be considered rudimentary on a
 higher  TL scout, for TL-11 it's not to be sneezed at. While neither a densitomiter or
 neutrino sensor are carried, they measure qualities unlikely to have changed
 over  seventy years since the last survey data was recorded. The 20 metre (4 hex)
 folding passive array is more than capable of filling in what blanks will exist
 in the charts, and doubles as a combat-capable space sensor. The 5 metre (2 hex)
 array gives the <I>Rhino</I> its own long-range sensor capability and allows two
 locations to be surveyed at once, should the need arise. 
 <P>
<B>Extended Survey</B> - it is quite possible for the ship to arrive in-system and have
 the <I>Rhino</I> descend to the planets surface for an extended duration (in the region
 of six months), possibly with pre-fab-labs set up in the cargo bay. The jump
 frame may remain to provide an orbital sensor platform, or may return to friendly
 space.
 <P>
<B>Diplomatic Contact</B> - in split configuration the <I>Rhino Hunter</I> creates a very safe
 environment indeed. In the event of trickery or ambush the contact team are
 mounted in an extremely fast (and heavily armed) military dropship with stealth
 capabilities, while watching over them is an orbital platform carrying two dozen
 100-kiloton cruise missiles.
 <P>
<B>Space Combat</B> - the <I>Rhino Hunter</I> is only minimally equipped for combat, designed
 not to attack enemy ships but to escape intact. If the ship jumped with a full
 fuel load (less than six G-turns expended) then it will have enough to perform
 an
 emergency Jump-2 immediately upon arrival. This capability may be extended by
 carriage of ballute fuel tankage. In extreme circumstances, the <I>Rhino</I> may be
 jettisoned to allow a jump home on less fuel (105 m<sup>3</sUP> vice 210 m<sup>3</sUP>). In the event
 of
 encountering a hostile target, evasion will be the normal tactic. While useful
 armament is limited to three missiles and a point defence laser, the Tacoma
 cruise
 missiles may usefully be employed as a nukescreen, deployed behind the ship and
 detonated to interfere with enemy sensor locks. Twenty four warheads should be
 enough to allow the <I>Hunter</I> to reach the safe jump limit. Note that while the
 <I>Rhino</I>
 is EM-Masked, the frame (and thus the joined ship) is not.
 <P>
 <B>Cold Relic Recovery</B> - should recovery of artifacts be required, the <I>Rhino</I> is
 well
 equipped to comply. Almost anywhere is accessible to the airframed, CG-equipped
 lander. Even underwater sites may be visited, simply by pumping 60 cubic metres
 of
 water in through the fuel scoops to act as ballast. (Still allowing 75% of the
 tanks to contain LH2.) The 14-ton cargo bay may be increased by a further 2-tons
 by removal of the two low berths, mounted on quick-detach floor pallets for this
 very reason. In addition, breaching walls (or vaults) is quite easy with the
 plasma cannon.
 <P>
<B>Hot Relic Recovery</B> - difficult against a well-defended target due to the lack of
 troop capacity, but the <I>Rhino</I> is capable of destroying a small force with the
 plasma cannon and/or deadfall ordnance. Use of the Orbit-to-Ground tactical
 nukes
 is usually considered excessive.
 <P>
<B>Cleansing of Severe Viral Infections</B> - In the event of a malignant infection
 being
 located on a plantary surface, each of the twenty-four Tacoma cruise missiles
 carried will utterly destroy a circle nearly a kilometer across. While the
 Assembly has thankfully never yet had to order a CSVI mission, STREA's vessels
 and
 crews remain ready to perform that grim task.
 <P>
<B> Search and Rescue</B> - the ship has a maximum capacity of nineteen passengers by
 hotbunking, plus four in coldsleep. If speed is paramount to reach a stricken
 ship, the <I>Rhino</I> may be seperated since it is considerably faster than the docked
 configuration.
 <P>
 <h3>Operations</h3>
 <P>
 The <I>Rhino Hunter</I> has a crew of nine, comprising two pilots, two engineers
 (electronics and power), one gunner, and four mission specialists. During
 seperation, one pilot, one power engineer (who doubles as a gunner) and the
 mission specialists normally ride in the <I>Rhino</I>, leaving one pilot with the
 electronics engineer and the gunner in the jump frame.
 <P>
 The <i>Rhino</I> has been converted from its original configuration. While the 120-MJ
 fusion gun and missile stub wings have been left in place, the EW suite and one
 of the TL-15 computers has been removed and allocated for military use. The fusion
 gun may be fired from any of the workstations; in the original dropship role the
 gunner was responsible for both fusion gun and launched ordnance, so the fusion
 gun was also tied into the EW and pilot's stations. In the scout configuration
 the gunnery station is normally not manned and the gun fired from the engineering
 station. The pilot has no control over the turret and can only fire the gun in
 boresight mode by steering the whole craft.
 <P>
 The <I>Rhino</I>'s cargo space has been reduced from 29 tons to 13.5 by the
 installation
 of three staterooms and two low berths in the bay, plus some repositioned
 control electronics. A decrease in mass means that the original drive can now accelerate
 the craft at 5.7G, to which end the internal bracing has been strengthened. 
 <P>
 The <I>Hunter</I> Jump Frame is constructed at TL-11, an unstreamlined crystaliron hull
 designed to wrap around the back end of a <I>Rhino</I>, while leaving the HEPlaR
 exhausts
 clear. The key capabilities provided by the jump frame are jump drive
 (obviously),
 a long-range sensor array, fuel purification facilties, and armament. 
 <P>
 The armament is served by a single gunner, and comprises a combination
 laser/missile turret, and a cluster of 24 launch tubes for orbit-to-ground
 missiles. The turret is a custom-built TL-11 design containing a workstation, an
 18-MJ 400-ROF PD laser and three launch canisters for detlaser missiles.
 Normally
 only TL-11 EaPlaC missiles are made available to scout vessels, although there
 are
 a number of recovered TL-15 HEPlaR missiles in circulation.
 <P>
 Orbit-to-ground capability is provided by launch tubes for Vesper <I>Tacoma</I> cruise
 missiles (http://www.nickb.ndirect.co.uk/weapons/Tacoma.html) carrying the
 Block-3Y 100kT tactical nuclear warhead. The orbit-to-ground version of the
 <I>Tacoma</I>
 has an added 8 G-turn EaPlaC solid boost rocket which burns for 10 minutes at up
 to 20G to provide the correct entry profile. These tubes cannot be reloaded from
 inside the ship.
 <P>
 The jump frame's flight deck has two pilot's stations, although only one is
 normally manned when seperated.
 <P>
 <P>
<B>Design Note</B> - Following a house design rule, I multiplied the volume of the
 grapple by 0.1 since it only works on one specific hullform. That's my
 compromise
 between full size (which is supposed to be able to hold anything up to that
 size)
 and no volume at all (a la pods in the RCEG).
 <P>
<B>Deckplans</i> - Deckplans are under construction - bear with me.
 <P>
 <h3>Design Requirements</h3> 
 <B>Volume</B> - The ship only displaced 100 tons, equal to a Type-S.<P>
 <B>Cost</B> - Four units may be built. While the ships are expensive, 13MCr comes from
 the Fusion Drive, which utilises off-the-shelf and proven TL-9 technology.<P>
 <B>Transport</B> - The ship can transport the required four specialists, plus another
 four in coldsleep if needbe. Cargo capacity exceeds the stated requirement by
 60%,
 and incorporates handy clamshell loading doors big enough to fit a Trepida
 through
 (should you ever want to).<P>
 <B>Jump</B> - By utilising state-of-the-art drives, the <I>Rhino Hunter</I> can cover 2
 parsecs
 in a single jump. In fact, it will often be able to perform an emergency jump
 upon
 arrival, if required.<P>
 
  <B>Combat</B> - While not a combat ship, the <I>Rhino Hunter</I> has a lot of options for
 evasion and is in our opinion eminently survivable.
 <P>
 In conclusion, while partially constructed at TL-9/11, the <I>Rhino Hunter</I> compares
 favourably to the standard Type-S Scout/Courier. The increased expense is a
 direct
 result of using lower tech (especially that damn fusion rocket. With HEPlaR the
 two ships cost almost the same.) The Type-S has better range on its sensors, but
 the <I>Rhino Hunter</I> is far more versatile. 
 <P>
 And, of course, it carries firepower equivalent to eighteen hundred times its
 own
 weight in TNT.
