The <I>Cleon</I> Class Tender is a behemoth vessel, displacing three times as much
as a <I>Voroshilef</I> Class Battleship. Carrying a squadron of six <I>Admiral</I> Class
Battle Riders over insterstellar distances, the valuable and fragile Tenders
usually disengage and retreat to a safe distance before battle is joined;
often screened by one of their riders.
<P>
About two-thirds of the vessel's hull is filled with fuel for the massive
jump drive and HEPlaR torches required to haul it and its deadly cargo into
battle. While the tender is unstreamlined, a <I>Cleon</I> Battle Group is capable
of conducting wilderness refuelling by using the <I>Admirals</I> as fuel shuttles.
A total of twenty scooping sorties are required to refill the <I>Cleon</I>'s tanks,
each requiring just over two and a half hours. With six <I>Admirals</I> scooping
and then refilling their own tanks, the group may refuel in just over ten
hours; twenty hours after which the fuel will be totally refuelled by the
vast plants onboard the <I>Cleon</I>. Scooping and refining enough fuel for an
emergency Jump-1 escape takes only six hours.
<P>
The vessel is very lightly armed, with only a Meson Gun and a few defensive
laser turrets. Sensors and communications are comprehensive, allowing the
tender to stay out of the way of danger.
<P>
The Tender is armoured to 18AV. Since it is capable of a 2G acceleration
(actually closer to 3G without riders and ignoring structural limitations),
this is slightly under safe limits, but the required 20AV equates to a BR
armour value of 1, greater than the value listed on the card.
<P>
I gave up totally on trying to get the surface area values to work, since
with just the battle riders, the drives, screens and jump drive, the total
surface area had been exceeded. I went for an Open Structure and assumed the
very open arrangement shown on the counter gave additional surface area not
accounted for by the FFS design system. (So this one has the correct Meson
Screen value.)
<P>
I'd like to create a non-canonical version where the Cleon carried a couple
of squadrons of fighters for self defence. It seems crazy to me to have such
a valuable ship so defenceless, and holding back one sixth of the battle
group to act as a screen is just a silly use of resources.
