Keluin's latest SDB design, the '1000's' (the bueacracy hasn't named them
yet, and the expansionists are lobbying for the non-naming of boats to
include SDBs) are intended to give adequate protection to the home system,
while being cheap enough to allow for the continuation of the current
starship construction programme.
<P>
The real reason that these ships are being built at all is the increasing
support that the isolationists are getting in the Assembly. In an attempt
to appease them the latest revision of the _Five Year Plan for Naval
Procurement_ has included them, and various support vessels and some minor
local base upgrades. The Expansionists feel that the whole thing is a waste
of time, effort and money, while the isolationists think that they are way
too small and not enough of them have been ordered. There is also a small
faction in the moderates who think that spending the same money on Fulton
MBs from Fulton would be a more sensible answer, but nobody else likes this
at all (repair of TL13 units and national pride both work against this
proposal).
<P>
The 1000's are being built on a spherical hull in order to make the armour
as light as possible (4G's and guns at TL11 isn't easy), and are
unstreamlined to save money. Even so they are expensive for their size.
<P>
The crew are quartered with two enlisted men to a room, but the officers
each have a room of their own. This has provoked the usual flurry of
criticism from those who feel that more G-Hours (or armour, or whatever) is
of more use than crew comfort is. The reason that comfort was chosen as an
important criteria is that even as the 5-year plan was being revised it was
known that it's very likely that the next revision, due in about 6 months
will cut back the SDB budget. Thus rather less of these boats will be in
service than most people expect and it is vital that they be able to patrol
away from any bases for extended periods. As a result the architects took
on board the lessons that the FLN Navy learnt with FLN Fulton and her
sister boats.
<P>
The weapon mix is intended to provide the commander with a range of
options, allowing them the luxury of a flexible approach to a threat. The
twin lasers will penetrate 38cm of Crystaliron armour (or 22cm of
Superdense) at up to 1 light second, and the standard missiles launchers
can handle longer ranges with a salvo of up to eight missiles. The suite is
rounded out with two turrets for 4 m^3 missiles. Each turret has five
missiles armed with a 10kt det laser warhead and capable of 12G12 performance.
