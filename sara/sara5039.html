<HR> 
  One of the more common ships in the post-Collapse Federation Navy, the
 DD-IVb is highly capable and versatile.  Capable of the J4 (Pre-Collapse)
 standard of the Federation Navy, the DD-IVb is fueled for an extra J1,
 additionally retaining an additional 3.7 hours reaction mass at full 5G
 acceleration.<P>
    The ships high versatility comes w/ a high price tag of 2 and a half
 billion credits, but the ship has proven most versatile in the
 potentially hostile environment of the New Era.  Exploration, Survey,
 Convoy Escort, patrol, and squadron duties in the line of battle are all
 missions the Destroyer was intended for and it has compiled an impressive
 record of success in the period following the Collapse.<P>
    An extensive sensors suite is the arguably the largest asset possessed
 by the DD-IVb destroyer.  The possession of 7 sensor drones (a full
 compliment not always possessed, depending on deployment and mission) is 
 another.  The offensive and defensive capabilities are widely publicized
 in the Federation.<P>
    The DD-IVb was (successfully) argued as ideally suited to exploring
 the hostile and dangerous Wilds (and the space of the former Third
 Imperium, in particular) by M. Gualee, a noted Manipulator in the Naval
 Procurement Topical Club.  The only debate to the Post-Collapse Destroyer
 Project was due to its high cost per vessel, but opposition to the
 Project was minimal, prompting many to speculate at just who engineered the
 manipulation in the Naval Appropriations Topical Club, seeing that the
 necessary funding for the initial production order (of 100 destroyers) was
 easily granted (lacking the long debate that characterized the
 Post-Collapse Light Carrier Manipulation).  Others have remarked on how
 many manipulations must have been masked by the propagation of the DD-IVb
 in the Naval Procurement Topical Club.<P>

<h3>Notes</H3>

Total Fuel Tankage: 20615.2 m<sup>3</sup> (1472.5 tons)<BR>
Fuel scoops (9% of ship surface), fills tanks in 1.4 hours<BR>
Fuel purification machinery (40MW), 15.5 hours to refine 20615.2 m<sup>3</sup>.<BR>
299.7 MW power shortfall.
<P>
Power requirements necessitate the shutdown of the CG Lifters to allow 
the full ROF for both the NPAW and the defensive x-ray laser turrets (and
yield a .3MW power surplus).  The CG Lifters may be engaged with all
other systems powered if the NPAW or the Laser turrets have their ROF cut
to 50 (-1 Diff Mod). Each will yield a power surplus (367MW for the NPAW
and 60.3MW for the laser turrets).
<P>
300Mj Laser barbettes organized in 3 batteries of 2, controlled via MFD by
the fire control center.  The 144Mj X-ray Laser turrets are each controlled
by their own MFD, and are primarily intended for point-defense, though may
be employed on offensive attacks.  One MFD (missle capable) is on the
bridge, the others are all in the Fire, Control Center.  The bridge MFD is
intended as the auxilliary MFD, as there are an adequete number of MFDs in
the fire control center to control all of the weapons on the ship.
<P>
Mass and cost of drones included w/ the ship, though the price of small
craft for the 100dt hangar is not (570 tonnes mass included in loaded
mass).  The drones are stored in the missle bay.
<P>
50dt autoloaded 5 launcher missle missle bay is equipped w/ a crewman and
laser commo system for non-MFD control of missles, as an auxilliary
means of missle control and supervision and maintenance of the bay.
