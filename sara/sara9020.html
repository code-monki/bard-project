  In compliance with the �Nebula-8� program to advance the rate of exploration
  in the Wilds, Consolidated-Amalgamated has introduced two new subsidized
  designs � the 100dt <a href="sara9019.html"><I>Guppy</I></A> class and it's larger cousin the 200dt
  <I>Mudskipper</I> class.<P>
  Both vessels are based on common existing designs to help them �blend-in�
  with local space traffic. This also allows for easy procurement of parts and
  servicing: both designs maintain over 50% compatibility with the designs
  they originated from. The two ships have a modular design internally,
  allowing existing systems to be swapped out and replaced with different
  packages or upgraded to the owner�s tastes. Consolidated-Amalgamated has a
  wide variety of upgrades available for these ships. The two vessels are made
  with as many identical parts as possible (including the entire electronics
  package) to simplify production and maintenance of a large fleet.
  The frames of both models have been reinforced to grant additional longevity
  to the ships or to allow the installation of more powerful engines.
  Due to the overwhelming demand, both of these designs come equipped with
  ground support weapons as part of their basic equipment. However, these
  ships are not recommended as dedicated fire-support platforms as they lack
  the protection of an AFV and the agility of an air-superiority fighter.
 <P>
The <I>Mudskipper</I> is based on the Far Trader frame � perhaps the most common
silhouette seen in post-Collapse space. The <I>Mudskipper</I> comes deliberately
low on extras so that ships can be altered as needed into one of several
formats: salvage/trade, exploration, supply/refueling, combat/system defense
or troop transport. It sports an enormous cargo bay capable of being altered
into whatever format the crew needs.

<P>
The <I>Mudskipper</I> is a larger, more flexible platform than the <I>Guppy</I> class
vessels. Ironically, there's not much more in a <I>Mudskipper</I> than the smaller
craft. Mudskippers will typically receive additional modifications late in
production or as a post-production refit. This gives local systems greater
flexibility in catering to the ship's final purpose. Even as-is the ships
are rugged, durable and simple craft with a spacious cargo bay. Like the
Guppy, Mudskippers are often subsidized by local governments in an effort to
promote interstellar trade and exploration.
In order to fulfill the basic mission objectives for the Nebula-8 program,
the <I>Mudskipper</I> must be retro-fitted with an additional 4 small staterooms in
the cargo hold. These were omitted from the current design to speed
production of a craft that required fewer personnel.
Although <I>Mudskipper</I>s are new vessels, they are usually given a "dent &
scratch" treatment that cosmetically alters them to appear more like
existing free traders in the Wilds.

<h3>Notes</H3>

  Fuel scoops can collect 1400kl/hour, filling the ship�s tanks in 41
minutes. The fuel purifier can refine 255m3 every 6 hours. Full tanks can be
purified in 22.5 hours hours.<P>
The <I>Nail</I> launcher can accept any of the family of <I>Nail</I> missiles. The
missiles can be fired from the combat crewstation provided for the ground
support weapons. The DEI laser can be used as a laser designator, if needed.
 It takes 30 minutes to reload the missile tubes and can be done internally
from the cargo bay.<P>
The DEI laser is a ground support weapon housed in a small turret on the
underside of the ship. The turret is equipped with advanced stabilization
and can be fired at any speed. The laser can fire up to 10 shots per second,
although this is a serious drain on the ships power (90.924 Mw). The laser
does not use gravitic focusing. With the addition of a fire control computer
and remote sensors, the laser can act as as a sentry gun. An additional
turret can be added to the top of the craft to act as a point defense
battery or anti-aircraft weapon.<P>
The frame of the <I>Mudskipper</I> is designed to support 3-G's of stress.
