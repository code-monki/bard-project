Very few of the <I>Breton</I> class light cruisers were available in time to see
service in the First Solomani Rim War, and consequently the production run
was slowed as a result of the end of the war, many examples being scrapped
partially completed. Some new construction did continue though at a reduced
rate until the Third Imperium began to break apart, at which time
construction was accelerated on those vessels not yet completed to clear
yards for higher production work. <I>Breton</I>s were typically employed as small
squadron flagships, convoy escorts and as commerce raiders. They had a good
maneuver rating at 5G though endurance was somewhat limited when this was
employed, but their limited jump range, jump-3 reduced their flexibility.
<P>
One division of four <I>Breton</I>s was captured by the Third Imperium during the
latter days of the First Solomani Rim War at the battle of Terra. None of
them had functioning jump drives. These were taken into Imperial service and
served for many years at Dingir before being mothballed.
<P>
When the Civil War erupted the Imperial's solitary <I>Breton</I> CruDiv was
reactivated. They fought heroically, and two, <I>Davenport</I> and <I>Fremantle</I> were
re-taken by the Solomani. <I>Davenport</I> was damaged beyond repair during that
encounter. <I>Fremantle</I> was repaired and served with others of its type until
virus struck. Her fate is unknown beyond that point.
<P>
It is believed that a number of <I>Breton</I> class light cruisers are operating in
the Banners sector, whether by virus or other entity is not yet known.

<h3>Notes</H3>
Fuel purification equipment (141.875Mw) is sufficient to purifiy 28,375
cubic meters in 6 hours (30 hours for entire load exclusive of power plant
fuel) Fuel scoop capacity is 70,000 cubic meters per hour (2.03 hours for
entire load exclusive of power plant fuel).
