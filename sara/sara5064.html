 The Imperial Navy first built the <I>Transit</I>
class Destroyer in the late 790s to fill the light
fleet escort, screening and pursuit roles. It came
equipped with a large fighter bay to enable recon and
early warning roles, and a sizeable 10 GJ PAW mount to
protect the main fleet body against enemy strike and
recon ships. Never a popular design owing to its
limited armor and short range, and the availability of
better ships,  the class served a scant fifty years
with the Imperial Navy before advancing technology
made it obsolete.  Most of the class was placed in
mothballs among the Navy's many reserve depots, and
the remainder were either used for target practice or
as merchant auxillaries.
<P>
The class would have remained forgotten if not for the
intervention of the Imperial Civil War. Each competing
faction activated a handful of these ships, and
impressed them into service. Most served during the
height of the Black War as base ships for strike teams
and their supporting fighters.  In the Domain of Deneb
however, defense was a more pressing need than
planetary strike, and the ones they activated were
modified with grapples for small battle riders. In the
aftermath of the Collapse and especially the Rape of
Trin, the shortage of military starships compelled the
new Regency Navy to activate the fifty or so <I>Transit</I>
that were still in storage, and heavily modify them
for frontier service against Virus. Most were upgraded
with surplus TL-14 armaments and life support. The
most crucial modification was a grapple for a TL-14
1000 ton <I>Gargoyle</I>battle rider, and hangar space for a
number of other supporting craft.
<P>
Cargo capacity is tight, as is fuel usage, and the
addition of the rider limits jump performance to 2
when it is attached. But these modifications allowed
the Regency to create small pocket task forces cheaply
and quickly. The class is thinly deployed around the
entire perimeter of the Regency, patrolling critical
border and areas of the Regency Frontier. Most vessels
located away from the Deeprim are used in commercial
patrol and
piracy supression roles. A sizeable number of new
ships have been produced by the Regency's neighbors in
the Spinward Hinters for their navies.
<P>
The vessel is overweight with the <I>Gargoyle</I> attached,
and it is only carried during jump, which dovetails
with its SOP.
