<p>It should be noted that while the <i>Saturn</i> Class carry cargo, they are a purely military design. Their intended role as a Priority Transport is to carry small, valuable and often secret cargoes rapidly and safely to wherever they are required. A carrier stranded for want of a jump drive component? Send in a QF.
<p>Constructed as a joint venture between two subsector Navies, the <i>Saturn</i>s were conceived as small but versatile ships, able to earn their keeps on the limited budget available for non-combatant starships. Reasonably armed and well defended, they employ stealth as a primary means of survival. These ships completed a vast range of missions, from the main priority transport role to insertion of covert operatives, secret reconnaissance, survey and even, in the case of CNS Styx, service as a Missile Boat with a converted hangar and cargo bay.
<p>Viewed from outside, the <i>Saturn</i>s present a vaguely sinister profile, being covered with black EMS absorbant material. The surface is also faceted to reduce sensor profiles further. More design wierdness is provided by the six fins radiating out of the tail, covered in solar collectors. These are able to generate life support and controls power without the need to run the fusion reactors.
<p>Working down thriugh the decks: Zero deck, at the top, is not inhabited. The upper half of the boat hangar occupied the front half of the main body, with a tapered fuel tank behind it. Two large fuel sponsons, Alpha and Beta, sit outboard of this.
<p>One Deck, immediately below, is wider, and contains both the boat hangar and the cargo hold., as well as the upper HEPlaR thruster. Personnel access is by two ladders into the cargo bay, from which one must pass through either the auxiliary airlocks or the cargo loading door into the hangar.
<p> Two deck is the main system deck. At the very nose sits the bridge, with positions for the Captain, Pilot, and Navigator. A large viewscreen occupies the front wall, with two smaller screena offset to either side. Behind the bridge are the Primary Computer (a TL-15 Fib, manufactured by Dayta Windstrom) and the Control/Comms Room. 
<p> Ocupying the neck of the ship are the nine staterooms for the crew and up to eight passengers. Each contains a double bunk and a desk/locker combination unit. Amidships are the two passages laeding to the port and starboard sandcaster positions, which may also be used as backup airlocks in an emergency. Behind the casters are the low berths, added to the ship during design at the request of the Navy's Covert Operations Directorate. The backup computer is also located here, seperated from the primary and jump computers for survivability. <p>Finally comes the engineering section, containing the control room, jump drive and reactors. Entry into the engineering section is gained through an internal airlock, and the air recyclers are normally isolated from the rest of the ship for safety reasons. A narrow catwalk around the jump core provides maintenance access, as well as a route through to the reactor bay.
<p>Three deck is split into two sections; the pod at the nose, and the body. The pod contains the processors and controls for the active and passive sensor arrays, as well as the laser turret and gunnery station. The laser gunner's station has the ship's MFD built into it and cannot be fired without the use of the MFD, due to an incompatibility between the Cluster Munitions laser controls and the Anartech FireLance missile launch hardware. The main access airlock is also locatwed in this section.
<p>The nose of the body section is occupied by the missile launch bay, magazine and control station. Ten ready-launch missiles are carried in autoloading cradles which feed forward into the bay and are ejected downward. One missile may be controlled from the Missile Director's station, more than one requires the services of the MFD from the laser control system.
<p> Behind the missile units sit the fuel processing unit, the lower half of the jump core, and the Contra-Gravity lifter unit. All of these may only be accesses via the ladders from the upper deck, not from the missile station.
<p> &nbsp </p>
<p>The <I>CNV Charon</I>, QF-02 was found dead in space in 1202 in the uninhabited Lindstrom Beta system, in eccentric orbit around a gas giant. All the crew were dead and the only surviving passenger had managed to make it to a low berth before life support gave out. Sustained for seventy four years by the solar-power system, he was revived by a joint Korinall Cluster Navy and STREA expedition. Subsequent examination showed that the Charon's jump core and power plants were irreperably damaged, although a few primary systems had survived intact. Since the disaster had occurred before Collapse, virus was not a factor, although two of the three computers had been destroyed, by means unknown.
