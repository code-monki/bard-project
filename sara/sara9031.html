The <I>Sabre Expediter</I> is a private design
first built for a number of mid-sized courier
companies operating in the Spinward Marches. Given the
slow and arbitrary nature of the defunct Imperial
X-Boat system, a booming market in quick data
transference existed in many frontier areas. The
Expediter served mostly in the rimward parts of the
Marches, linking worlds like Trin and Glisten with the
scattered Imperial outposts and industrial worlds of
Trojan Reach. When the Aslan invaded during the Civil
War period, the companies that owned or leased these
vessels were driven deeper into the Domain of Deneb,
and the ship became a common sight along many main
trade arteries along the Midway and the Stronghold.
The lower maintenance costs and greater flexibility of
the design have subsequently made it a mainstay of the
new X-Web, with several hundred working primarily in
the interior of Deneb and along the Reft Highway.
<P>
The vessels main competitive edge over the old X-Boats
was its J-5 ability, enabling to transfer data at a
faster rate over long distances. Limited passenger and
for high priority mail and freight made these ships
even more valuable. The vessel was originally designed
to be unarmed, but all examples of the class
constructed in the last twenty years now carry two
hardpoints. The gunner listed in the crew complement
is usually not carried on unarmed versions, and the
extra stateroom is freed up for additional passengers
or cargo. Like most couriers, the vessel carries an
additional computer for data handling and storage. The
vessel has been a godsend for the Regency and its
overstretched communications; the one complaint has
centered around its limited reaction mass carriage and
low Heplar endurance. Some crews have also complained
about its inability to carry high impact weaponry.
