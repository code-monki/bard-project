<HR> 
      The Reformation Coalition Navy (RCN) has completed negotiations 
for the purchase of six  <I>Manticore</I>-class system defense boats (SDBs) 
from the Aubani Navy, with an option for more to follow. These
 vessels are being purchased to give the RCN a battle rider 
capability when used with <I>Aurora</I> or <I>Maggort</I>-class clippers. 
These SDBs are modified versions of the standard <I>Shukugon( Dragon)</I>
 class TL-12 SDBs, manufactured for centuries in the Last Imperium. 
The <I>Manticores</I> are distinguished from the basic <I>Dragons</I> by the
 absence of the <I>Dragon</I>'s missile barbettes and fuel purification
 plant.These are replaced by a spinal meson gun which gives the 
<I>Manticore</i> a powerful short-range punch, sufficient to disable much 
larger vessels.<p>

   The <I>Manticores</I>, which have been used up to now in the system 
defense of Aubaine, will be used as "battle riders," carried 
into combat one or two at a time by RCN clippers configured as 
"tenders." The battle rider concept is an old one, and reflects 
a permanent principle of interstellar combat. Given the fact that 
interstellar jump driver and their supporting systems make 
significant demands on the mass and volume of a starship, two 
spacecraft of equal size, one equipped with jump drives, and one
 without, will demonstrate vastly differing utilizations of space.
 The ship without jump drive will
have a great deal of additional space that can be allocated to
 weapons, armor, defensive screens, fire control, ammunition,
 greater maneuverability, and fuel, and will therefore be a better
 warship, albeit unable to travel between star systems on its own.
 In a confrontation between these two ships, the  nonjump-capable 
vessel should beat the jump-capable starship every time. This 
fact is the basis of the system defense boat. By extending this 
concept to include large jump-capable ships which carry these 
nonjump capable warships from star to star, the battle rider 
concept is born.
<p>
       The jump-capable ships. called tenders, carry several 
nonjump-capable ships, called riders, or battle riders, into 
enemy star systems. The battle riders detach and engage the 
enemy, and are recovered by the tender following the battle. 
The drawback to the battle rider concept  is the fact that a 
losing battle rider force has a very hard time withdrawing, 
as battle 
riders cannot simply jump out of the battle to a safe system. 
 The requirement to rejoin the large, non-maneuverable, and 
poorly defended tender in order to escape creates a vulnerability
 that ensures  that a defeated battle rider force is usually
 annihilated, where as a defeated jump-capable force is usually 
much less severely mauled.  
<p>
from <cite>Challenge</cite> #74<p>

Its impossible to build a TL-12 meson gun with the stats from 
<cite>Battle Rider</cite>, so John Macpherson designed a TL-15 meson gun.
Aubaine salvaged these meson guns from pre-collapse submarines which 
patrolled the oceans of Vras.
