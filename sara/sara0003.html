<FONT SIZE=6><I>Cutlass</I>-Class System Patrol Boat</FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=2>design by <A HREF="mailto:lewis@chara.gsu.edu">Lewis Roberts</A></FONT><P>

<HR>

The <I>Cutlass</I>-Class was built using lessons learned in the
designing the <I>Hobnail</I>-class SDB. Its designers thought it
was a bit to small to be called a System Defense Boat, so the
type designation System Patrol Boat was created.  The
<I>Cutlass</I>-Class has the same performance as the
<I>Hobnail</I>-Class, but without the planetary bombardment
facilities, the Configuarable Pod, and a smaller cargo bay.  This
allows the ship to be built on a smaller hull and for considerably
less money.  <P>

The <I>Cutlass</I>-Class is designed purely for the export market.
The salespeople pitch the ship as a small highly armed ship
capable of patrolling a system. It won't take out a Vampire
Capital ship, but is more than capable of fighting off a pirate,
smuggler or rebel ship.<P>


While the ship is streamlined, it doesn't not normally enter planetary atmospheres. Its fusion engines would contaminate the biosphere of any planet.  It normally only enters the atmosphere of gas giants.  Since the ship can not land on the planet's surface to pick up crew and supplies, these are normally supplied by surface-to-orbit shuttles.  If the planet does not have the capacity to build such vehicles, the Oriflamme have several models that clients can purchase.<P>

<H4>Notes</H4>
Total Fuel Tankage: 41.4 m3 (3.0 tons).<BR>
Fuel scoops (10% of ship surface), fills tanks in 0.04 hours.<BR>
Fuel purification machinery (1.8MW), 1.24 hours to refine 41.4 m3.<BR>
Crew requirements are calculated by using 'Original FFS' crew model.
53.5 MW power surplus with the fusion rockets powered, without them on, there is a power deficiet and careful power managment is neccesary. Usually this is made up by turning off unneccesary equipment.
