A class of ship, believed to be christened the <I>Eben Emael</I> Class 
Sloop, is reportedly used by Ides of March "Black Eagle" covert 
operations teams.  The Ides of March deny maintaining either covert 
operations teams or the ships to support them.  Ship names are believed 
to include <I>Eben Emael</I>, <I>Cabanatuan</I>, <I>Son Tay</I>,
<I>Entebbe</I>, <I>Mogadishu</I>, and at 
least two others.  On operations, they would be given the markings of 
either civillian ships or given a coating of black radar-absorbent 
paint.  It is significant to note that they do not have the prefix RMS 
(Registered Mercenary Ship) as formally, they don't exist. . . <P>

Atmospheric performance stats and stats for the plasma weapons will be 
sent shortly.  The stats in RCEG and Striker II are off on the ranges.<P>
 
<B>History of the ship names</B>:
Eben Emael was a fort on the Belgian border in 1940.  The first shots 
of the German's 1940 offensive were fired there.  A reinforced company 
of parachutists were dropped in gliders and eliminated the entire fort 
in about 20 minutes.  Cabantuan was a Japanese prisioner of war camp in 
the Phillipines.  When the US landed on Luzon in Jan 1945, the 
commander was afraid the US POWs would be massacred.  So he sent a 
Ranger Batallion to rescue them.  Son Tay refers to the raid on a 
Vietnamese POW camp which went perfectly according to plan--US 
casualties amounted to a twisted ankle--but the POWs had been moved out 
by the Vietnamese only a few days earlier.  Entebbe is a city in 
Uganda.  Palestinians hijacked an Israeli aircraft and took it there, 
then released all non-Jewish prisioners.  Israel sent an element of 
their Sayaret Matkal Counterterrorist Unit (Sayaret Matkal means 
reconaissance unit of the General Headquarters of the Israeli Defense 
Force--all Israeli SOF units are known as Sayarets, best translated as 
scouts) backed up by paratroopers for security and killed all the 
terrorists, rescued all but three of the hostages (they were killed in 
the crossfire) and only lost one man, Lt. Col. Jonathan Netanyahu, the 
younger brother of the current Israeli Prime Minister.  Mogadishu is a 
reference to the raid by the GSG (literally border guards sharpshooter 
group--the German anti-terrorist force is part of their border guards)
on a terrorist-held airliner there in the 70s.  It also was sucessful 
with no casualties in the attack force or hostages.

<h3>Notes</H3>
Ship can jump 8 parsecs (in two jumps, obviously) 
without any further fuel remaining.  Each parsec not jumped translates 
to 14 G-turns.  Ship can skim fuel at the rate of 2240 cubic meters of 
unrefined fuel per hour, and refine it internally at the rate of 47.5 
cubic meters per hour.
