<HR> 

The <I>Valkyrie</I> was a very high-tech interceptor design which was being
developed by the Third Imperium in the early 1100s.  Unlike the lighter
9-ton <I>Iramda</I>, <I>Dragonfly</I>, and <I>Rampart</I> fighters commonly seen in
Imperial service, the <I>Valkyrie</I> was based on the 50-ton "heavy fighter"
model.  Heavy fighters trade stealth for the ability to carry additional
equipment, usually heavier weapons and more armor.  In the <I>Valkyrie</I>,
much of the additional available space was put into a high-performance
maneuver drive.  The primary mission of these craft was to intercept
enemy vessels and occupy them until reinforcements had a chance to 
arrive. <P>

The 12G maneuver drive installed in the fighter can make a squadron on
maneuvers perform maneuvers which can only be performed by missiles, and
the fighter has many more G-hours available than a standard missile does.
Imperial G-compensation technology was stretched to its' limits in order
to allow the crew to withstand so much acceleration for even a short 
time.  Ensconced in their G-tanks and with the 7G compensators operating
at full capacity, the crew can function continuously at accelerations
of up to 10G, or 9G of evasion, with no ill effect.  Above these levels,
all tasks are one difficulty level more difficult per additional G-turn
applied.  Most crews are therefore equipped with neural links so that
they can regain a difficulty level under extreme maneuvers.  Even so,
accelerations above 10G are used only for brief periods and under very
specific circumstances.  Unfortunately, Virus-infected craft are not
bound by this restriction, as they need carry no organic crew.  
Fortunately, such craft are quite rare.<P>

The <I>Valkyrie</I> design is very tight.  The original prototype had fiber
optic computers installed, but these were removed in later models on
the grounds that they were too expensive, and the space filled with a
small cargo bay and additional fuel.  A compact tech-16 144 MJ laser
was installed which replicated the performance of the tech-15 laser
lance of the same power.  The fighter can carry two fully-independent
missiles.  Both crew members are somewhat overworked, one with flying
and fighting the craft, the other with baby-sitting the gigantic 
propulsion system.  Since the vehicle has no airlock, but only an access
hatch, the vehicle must be depressurized in order to perform an EVA, 
but this is typical in fighter designs.  Facilities are provided to
allow the <I>Valkyrie</I> to make extended patrols or sweeps of an area, a
traditional heavy fighter role.<P>

While performing well in tests by the Massilia Fleet and Deneb Fleet,
two flaws exist in this vehicle.  First, she is somewhat under-armed
for her size, and second, she is a bigger sensor target than the 
typical 9-ton fighter.  Additional missile grapples might be installed, 
but at the cost of a G of performance; a slightly larger HEPlaR thruster
to help address this problem was proposed for the next variant.  Some
experiments with robotic assistance to lighten crew workload were also
performed.<P>

Combat advice:  Note that if you aren't going to be using all twelve
gees of acceleration, you can overpower the laser x10 and pick up the
-2 bonus.<P>
