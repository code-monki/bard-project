Libert Space Defence Associates (A wholly owned subsidiary of
Sternmetal Horizons), is proud to present the 'Persistence'
-Class System Defence Boat, to fulfil INIreq 1080/107/2354. 
The afore mentioned Imperial Navy Requirement is for a Naval
SDB, built to Navy standards, for defending Naval facilities. <p>


In detailing our entry, let's start with the armament - the 
most vital part of any warship. Our ship is fitted with 
4 Instellarms 'Ravager' X-ray barbettes, of 729 Mj intensity,
capable of firing at a rate of 13.334 times a minute. Any 
standard warship of sub 10,000 dTons caught in their glare is 
going to feel a whole universe of hurt fast. A secondary battery
of two Instellarms 'Fusillade' X-ray turrets can add to this 
onslaught or concentrate on other vessels, and with a fire rate 
of almost 27 times a minute they are guaranteed a hit. Their 
output intensity is 289 Mj. The offensive weaponry is rounded 
out by a 25 Ton missile bay, with a reload magazine of 24 
missiles. An additional 6 missiles can be carried in the 3 
launchers associated with the bay, and the autoloaders that 
feed them. All of these weapons are manned, providing control 
under the most trying of circumstances. In normal operation 
4x300,000 km range MFDs will provide guidance.<p>

Before we go on to talk about the defences of the ship - we 
have to make some points about our choices for armament. I'm 
sure some people in the industry will be surprised at the lack 
of a Spinal Mount System. On reviewing the opponents our kids 
will have to go up against we decided against such an option. 
Whilst a Spinal PAW might impress opponents in Close Escorts 
and Destroyers, Fleet Escorts will just shrug them off. Meson 
Guns? Forget them! A gun to fit into a sub 1000 dTon hull is 
not going to have much effect on even a Destroyer Escort with 
a reasonable screen. X-ray lasers provide the penetration and 
damage necessary to hurt Fleet Escorts.<p>

With that point addressed, on to defences. Firstly, the heavily
armoured hull, this is durable enough that it will require the
attentions of a Fleet Escort to make an impression. Meson 
protection is provided by an INIstd2 Screen. Eight decoy 
dispensers with a total capacity of 1280 decoys, coupled with 
EM masking and a 300,000 km jammer make the Persistence a 
slippery customer. Unwanted missile attention can be dealt with
by the 4 dual X-ray CIWS, rated with a ROF equal to that of the
secondary battery. Two dedicated MFDs provide targeting for 
these unmanned weapons. The defences are rounded out with a 
standard sand turret.<p>

With 7G's acceleration, and a duration of almost 9 hours at max
acceleration, this ship has the edge over even our own Imperial 
Navy - and that's as it should be. However - it possesses the 
same tactical limitation of most SDBs - no jump capability. 
Whilst lack of a Jump Drive frees up the space to make SDBs 
deadly effective in combat, it leaves them with less scope for 
retreat, limiting the types of survivable engagements possible. 
We have combated this by adding a low acceleration Fusion 
Rocket, with enough tankage for 150 days thrust. Using the Heplar
tankage could multiply this by a factor of a hundred. There's 
nowhere in a system off-limits to this ship, so the blow against 
the enemy could come from any direction!<p>

Even with this ship's superb performance, damage is inevitable
in combat, which is why the sensors have multiple redundancy.
The 480K range AEMS is covered by a 300K back-up, and the 240K
PEMS is backed up by not only one 210K unit, but 3 fixed 120K
units - when other ships will be running for cover to repair
themselves, our ship will be delivering the deathblow. Two 240K
ladars provide for lock-ons. And when combat is over, the
machine and electronics shops provide aid for repairs.<p>

Given a choice between crew comfort and survivability, comfort
usually suffers. Accommodation is tight, only the Captain has
a staterooms to himself, the other six officers share a stateroom
each. Everyone else must hot-bunk, but stateroom occupation does
not exceed 3 per stateroom. To alleviate this a dedicated rec.
lounge, of 4 dTons has been provided for crew entertainment, in
addition to the usual dual purpose canteen/lounge.<p>

The ship hull is a 55.52 metre airframed cylinder, resembling 
the Petty class merchant in form. <p>

The ship is rounded out with almost 7 dTons of cargo space, 
leaving the ship well equipped for long duration missions.<p>

In conclusion, we feel that our submission has the durability,
defensibility and armament to fulfil the requirement. In 
addition, its superb acceleration, coupled with it's long
duration fusion drive expands its effectiveness enormously,
allowing the ship's commander to engage and disengage enemies
successfully under most condition. This is the ship the Navy needs.
