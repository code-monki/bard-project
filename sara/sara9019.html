 In compliance with the �Nebula-8� program to advance the rate of exploration
 in the Wilds, Consolidated-Amalgamated has introduced two new subsidized
 designs � the 100dt <I><I>Guppy</I></I> class and it's larger cousin the 200dt
 <a href="sara9020.html"><I>Mudskipper</I></A> class.<P>
 Both vessels are based on common existing designs to help them �blend-in�
 with local space traffic. This also allows for easy procurement of parts and
 servicing: both designs maintain over 50% compatibility with the designs
 they originated from. The two ships have a modular design internally,
 allowing existing systems to be swapped out and replaced with different
 packages or upgraded to the owner�s tastes. Consolidated-Amalgamated has a
 wide variety of upgrades available for these ships. The two vessels are made
 with as many identical parts as possible (including the entire electronics
 package) to simplify production and maintenance of a large fleet.
 The frames of both models have been reinforced to grant additional longevity
 to the ships or to allow the installation of more powerful engines.
 Due to the overwhelming demand, both of these designs come equipped with
 ground support weapons as part of their basic equipment. However, these
 ships are not recommended as dedicated fire-support platforms as they lack
 the protection of an AFV and the agility of an air-superiority fighter.
 <P>
 The <I>Guppy</I> is based around the venerable MkXII Scout/Courier design. Using
 only TL-12 parts, the <I>Guppy</I> is designed as a low-cost, low maintenance
 vessel for exploration and transport. The <I>Guppy</I> is designed with an
 extremely fast turnaround time in-system: it can scoop its full tanks in
 less than half an hour and purify enough for a jump in just over three
 hours. If trouble shows up, it had better do so quickly...
 Although not designed as a gunship, it�s three turret sockets also allow the
 vessel to pack an unexpected punch in a firefight. When not needed for
 weapons, the turret sockets can hold additional cargo or fuel in pods now
 available.
 <P> 
 The <I>Guppy</I> is a simple exploratory/transport vessel. It is designed to be
 manufactured in large quantities or with limited resources. The ship is a
 no-frills design: captains looking for a dedicated combat vessel, yacht or
 blockade runner should consider extensive modifications or a dedicated
 warship for their needs. The <I>Guppy</I>'s primary goals are the exploration of
 the Wilds (with discretion) and fostering of interstellar communications.
 These ships are frequently subsidized by local governments with reduced
 costs, free upgrades or low-interest loans to promote the revival of space
 travel.
<P>
 The ship is capable of taking a 4 man team � in some discomfort � and their
 gear to a destination. If such transport is common, Consolidated-Amalgamated
 recommends adding an additional stateroom in the cargo hold.
 Although <I>Guppy</I>s are new ships, they are usually given a "dent & scratch"
 treatment that cosmetically alters them to appear more like existing ships
 in the Wilds. The enormous fuel scoops of the <I>Guppy</I> prevent them from
 effectively mimicing the Scout class vessels.

<h3>Notes</H3>
Fuel scoops can collect 1120kl/hour, filling the ship�s tanks in 26
minutes. The fuel purifier can refine 200m3 every 6 hours. Full tanks can be
purified in 14.5 hours hours.<P>
The <I>Nail</I> launcher can accept any of the family of <I>Nail</I> missiles although th
ship has no fire-control system installed. Instead, the missiles are fired
remotely and guided in with independent laser designators. It takes 30
minutes to reload the missile tubes and can be done internally from the
cargo bay.<P>
The frame of the <I>Guppy</I> is designed to support 3-G's of stress.
