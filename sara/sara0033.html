    Originally intended as a Temporary Base defensive ship, the concept
 was altered in the Fleet Tactics Topical Club along with input from the
 Memberworld System Defense Topical Club, primarily by the efforts of the
 Hiver, M. Nao.  The original concept, after dialogue with the Memberworld
 System Defense Topical Club was changed towards a Light Monitor, a ship
 class that was particularly sought out by memberworlds near the periphery
 of the rebuilding Federation, which were almost continually harrassed by
 Vampires, raiders, or both.  Elements of the Federation Navy were
 overextended and crucial funds were already being diverted to a large
 scale manipulation in Human space.  The Naval Procurement Topical Club
 then issued a mandate that the Light Monitor Project must be merged with
 the Light Battle Rider Project that had been continually resubmitted by
 the Fleet Tactics Topical Club with the understanding that the mission 
 parameters of the Light Monitor Project must also be accomidated.<P>
    The BRL-IIc as soon as the first units were deployed, was seen as
 quite capable.  It has very extensive offensive and defensive abilities,
 and was immediately seen as a capable defensive vessel for the Tender
 Project, as well, allowing jump capable elements of the Federation Navy
 to be spared for other missions.<P>
    An interesting manipulation has been recently revealed: that of the 
 "Christening" of the class as  <I>Tschudi</I>.   Such has long been a custom of
 Humans, Aslan, and Ithklur, as well as numerous other species, including
 the Reformation Coalition, in honoring famous places, personalities,
 battles, and qualities.  A Hiver supervisor in the Federation Naval
 Procurement Office was proccessing the orders for the newly constructed
 BRL-IIc's and inserted the name of a famous Hiver, Tschudi, a hero of the
 Federations' war with the K'kree (-2029 to -2013 Imperial), to test its
 theory that it could introduce a similar system in that of Federation
 Navy.  The name proved popular with the nests training to command the
 BRL-IIc, and for some reason to the irritation of the normally
 unflappable Ithklur.  The Federation Navy has officially stuck to the 
 designation BRL-IIc, but the popularity of the name is evident in that
 amongst most circles of the Federation Navy, the BRL-IIc is referred to
 as <I>Tschudi</I>.  Just recently, the Manipulations Club of Guaran has
 taken up debate over granting the Manipulator title to the Hiver, Brehn.<P>
    The upper circles of the Federation Navy have seen that the BRL-IIc
 has very high capabilities and current debate over the Post-Collapse
 Battlecruiser Project has revolved around including (possibly multiply)
 the BRL-IIc as either a Rider or as a defensive platform (modified), and
 the added expense such would make (especially as the Naval Appropriations
 Topical Club has stated that budget allowances will not be allowed to be
 exceeded).<P>
    Like other manipulations coming out of the Fleet Tacics Topical Club,
 the high price of the new design was adequetly funded by an ample
 appropriation from the Naval Appropriations Topical Club.  Members of
 Naval Appropriations claim that the additional funding was granted due
 to system defense clauses in the budget of the Federation Navy, but many
 have claimed that there is a large scale manipulation of at least of the
 Federation Navy, if not the upper levels of the Federation itself.  One 
 Hiver, one M. Aruhn, has warned of a manipulation that will bring a
 despotic government to an increasingly militarized Federation and that 
 evidence is seen in the high prices of the Federation Navy's newest
 vessels as well as an in-depth analysis of the debates in the Naval
 Appropriations, Naval Procurement, and Fleet Tactics Topical Clubs.
