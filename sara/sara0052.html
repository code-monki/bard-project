<hr>
<p> The Progress, designed by VAeSA, a small but traditional nomadic spacecraft
design agency, in close cooperation with a local high-G walker specialist
and the RQS bureau of the current temporal homeworld of VAeSA, is a 100 ton
TL 15 assault shuttle aimed more at the paramilitary/security market than
for large scale naval operations. </p>
<p> Its impressive 20 cm of enhanced BSD armour, the unique frog leg upside
down grappling technology, the EM Masking and the ability to survive atmospheric
dives of the docked ship &#8211; the shuttle is completely streamlined - make the
Progress a relatively safe ride if the opponents main armament has been properly
disabled. </p>
<p> The grappling apparatus, consisting of magnetic feet attached to two
legs extending to over 50 m of length, is positioned on top of the shuttle
as seen from the pilot and the gunner. Docking is therefore done somewhat
upside down. This has the advantage that the pilot can actually see the docking
process after removing an armoured &#8220;visor&#8221; coverage over the cockpit, if
the multiple redundant sensor vision is fading due to surface hits. Another
advantage is that the boarding crew can push themselves with their feet towards
the dockee when leaving through the cargo hatches. </p>
<p>
 After grappling, the up to 40 men in battlesuit (adequate seating, effectively
cramped taking into account the battlesuits) can leave the already decompressed
passenger room either through 2 small cargo hatches on the sides of the ship
or through one of the 3 air locks available for the boarding crew. Superior
fire support for the boarding crew is guaranteed by the 80 MJ short range
meson turret on the top side of the Progress. </p>
<p> The drawback of the design is that it is extremely stretched: No medical
support for the boarding crew, a very short vision (best sensor is 3 Hex
PEMS, so it has to rely on external support to even find the target) no dedicated
sensor operator (all the secondary sensors are only fallbacks and to be operated
only exclusive to all other sensors of the same class), being highly underpowered
(usually even the lights in the passenger room turn off when the EMS jammer
is activated during the final approach), missing CG capability (indeed very
uncommon for a streamlined hull, but aimed at a defensive role, the Progress
can afford to depend on orbital facilities) and, most of all, being very
short legged: due to the enormous mass of the 20 cm thick armour coverage
and the extremely high volume consumption of the streamlined grappling apparatus,
internal fuel is only sufficient for 17 G-turns &#8211; that much can be burnt
in less than 90 minutes - and even the two pairs of nearly unarmoured (50
points) 15 dt drop tanks which are available for 1.13 MCred (EMM version)
or 0.08 MCred  (unstealthed budget version) each are only of small help against
this disadvantage (first pair: 10 G-turns at 5 G, second pair: 14 G-turns
at 5 G). As a last resort Progress shuttles usually carry an emergency G-turn
in an unused compartment of the meson turret. Also, the reactor has only
fuel for one month of full power operation (not that the HEPlaR, which makes
up for about 95% of potential power consumption, could operate at full power
that long).   </p>
