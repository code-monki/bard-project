<HR> 
 	The idea behind the <I>Paladin</I> Class LSC is speed.  With enough
speed, one can get out of the way of missles (causing them to usually
coast into oblivion as they have little fuel), or evade with enough
Gs to make sensor locks nearly impossible.  Coupling this with the
craft's superior EW suite, which include flares, and the ship's small
size, it is a very difficult target.  However, the target has teeth. <P>
	When travelling at normal imperial speeds (ie less than 7Gs),
the ship is capable of a deadly accurate barrage that includes 60 
lasers.  Missles were added due to popularity, but are seldom used.
With one reload per launcher (more if the captain wants), this is a 
mostly energy based design.<P>
	The most dangerous weapons on the ship are the 800 Mj X-ray
lasers. Capable of penetrating all but the toughest of armor, these
lasers can easily turn a Small or medium ship inside out very quickly.
Also, these lasers can be underpowered to 50Mj allowing for an extremely
rapid fire against light enemy targets such as missles.<P>
	If the RQS accepts this ship as the certified "Vampire Hunter",
it can field as many as 111 of these. Operating in groups of 4, these
can easily defend large areas of territory effectively.<P>
	Complete with shops, these ships are capable of surviving in the
wilds for a long time.  Also, the large cargo hold allows for supplies
and parts along with additional missles, and modifications to be added.<P>

<h3>Notes</H3>
  Fuel scoops capable of ingesting 6,300 cubic meters (450 dt) per  
hour. Fuel purification machinery capable of refining  6,300 cubic 
meters in 24 hours (7.875 MW).  Standard Operating Procedure calls for
Lasers to be further overpowered when ship is travelling at less than
8-Gs.  All power lines reinforced for such an action.<P>
	The 800Mj turrets are equiped with Workstations, so if the MFDs
are destroyed, the 10 damage control members (1/2 of the engineering
crew) can double as gunners.  Of course they would get payed for both
jobs if they are to be trained as such.  Also, standard practice is to
have the two missle MFDs switch to beam MFDs after firing one barage.
The lasers also have an integral power plant that powers them to ROF:50.<P>

	The Quint-X lasers are extremely unusual.  By using Grav-Focused
X-ray lasers, they were able to mount 5 focal arrays in one 39m<SUP>3</SUP> turret.
They share a common HPG (nothing against it in the rules, it is just 
like having the HPG download at a higher ROF, which only requires a
bigger focal array), and have an integral power plant.<P>

	There is a 840kl Collapsible tank mounted in the cargo bay (it
is allready figured in), which reduces the cargo to 142.497m<SUP>3</SUP> when it
is loaded (which supplies an extra jump, or an extra 18.3 G-turns). The
2.497m<SUP>3</SUP> in the Cargo bay is in a section capable of being refitted as
a ground weapon turret, and usually is based on captain preference.<P>

	The large cargo bay (70dt) is used for supplies, missles, and
small craft as per captain preferences.  This allows for those who 
prefer more missles to get them.  <P>
