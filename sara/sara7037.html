The Al Morai corporation is a mid-sized
shipping line based at Mora/Mora in the Spinward
Marches. A powerhouse in the Domain of Deneb even
before the Collapse, the company's traders, merchants
and liners visited most A and B-class starports in the
Marches on a regular basis. Most famous of these were
the <I>World</I> class Merchant/Liners, a proprietary design
built for the company by Bilstein Yards of Glisten.
These 1G, j-4 vessels traveled the former X-Boat
lines, connecting major industrial worlds with the
Imperial mainstream.
<P>
The ship is a long sharpened needle in appearance,
with some likening it to a swan stretching it neck.
The vessel is optimised for use on settled trade
routes, and lacks either fuel scoops or fuel
processing plants. On a normal run it can carry in
excess of 700 tons of cargo (including the shuttle)
and 100 to 200 passengers, depending on occupancy
demand. The lower cargo hold is a "drive thru"
arrangement that allows loading from amidships and
aft. A single shuttlecraft is carried for passenger
and cargo disembarkation.
<P>
Since the Collapse, Al Morai has expanded its base of
operations into the remainder of the Regency, often
taking over the routes and facilities of competitors
bankrupted or destroyed by Virus. Despite this
expansion, shortages of new build starships due to
higher construction priority on military and RQS ships
has prevented the company from building enough new
ships to adequately cover these new routes. Many older
<I>World</I> class ships had been taken out of mothballs for
transport of populations from worlds hit by the
Abandonment, and these have been pressed into service
as quickly as the Navy repatriate them. Seventy three
of these ships are currently in service, with another
fourteen older ships working with the Regency Navy.

(Special Thanks to Claude Murdoch for providing the
stats from Traveller Campaign. However the stats may
vary a bit from the CT design, owing to the fact that
I accidentally deleted his reply.)
