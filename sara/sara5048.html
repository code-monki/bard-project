What's a warfleet without massive troop transports? True, in wartime liners and
other civilian starships are typically secured by the government for this job
(observe both World Wars), but for nasty naval assaults on defended worlds you
may want something more, umm, Sturdier. With, maybe, just a *little* bit more
armour.
<P>That's where the <I>Sudniidbaa</I> comes in. In it's typical operational use, it
comes in when the capital ships have silenced the major gun's on the world under
attack. It comes in between far orbit and 300,000 km off said world, and
releases it's deadly cargo of 50 x 50-ton troop transports, each with between 50
and 100 men in full battle armour. It also send out 5 x 50-ton modular cutters
(with a variety of possible modules in use, from anti-air to command posts to
vechile transport to cargo), and 10 x 15-ton fighters (to gently tend the brood
as it approaches it's destination, and provide immediate air cover when the
Marines arrive.)
<P>If a classic orbital assault is needed - with the troops being individually
shot out of the missile tubes to the drop zone - the <I>Sudniidbaa</I> has 30 missile
barbettes, permitting 150 men (max: this excludes cargo and ECM packages) to be
launched from far orbit every 30 minutes.
<P>These ships are actually commanded by Imperial Marine officers, rather than
Imperial Navy men. Each ship holds 2,500 men standard, enough for a full
regiment of marine infrantry. The following notes come from the Rebellion
Sourcebook (MT), pg. 36 Regiment: A regiment is composed of several battalions.
It is commanded by a colonel. Battalions: A battalion is composed of several
companies. It is commanded by a lieutenant commander. A battalion is the basic
military unit in the Imperium. It contains approximately 500 men. Companies: A
company is composed of several platoons. It is commanded by a captain.
<P>Note also that the 2,600 Marines carries are housed 4 to a large stateroom.
If neccessary, the staterooms can be 'hot-bunked', allowing 7,800 Marines to be
transported.
<P>Note the <I>Sudniidbaa</I> is capable of jump4, G5. It's capable of keeping up with
most naval strike forces, but will 'hang back', as it lacks a spinal mount. It
can defend itself, but isn't meant to attack: that's the job of it's mates.
<P>Also note that the <I>Sudniidbaa</I> does not carry extensive fighter wings, nor is
it meant to carry armoured battalions. The Imperial Marines are currently
working on a way to 'package' Trepida grav tanks and Astrin grav APC's so they
will fit into Yolanda docking rings. The first prototypes are expected to be
ready in 1117.
<P>NOTE: The <I>Sudniidbaa</I> is actually built to G6 specifications. However, due to
it's cargo load and transports, it cannot go faster than G5. Once it's cargo and
transports have been dropped off, however, G6 performance can be reattained.
<P>50-disp ton <a href="sara0041.html"><I>Yolanda</I> Troop Transport</A> is taken from Classic Trav's
'Fighting ships', and altered beyond recognition. The armour have been pumped up
to 100 levels, sensors and EM masking has been added, and an optional 'heavy
anti-personnel' laser put in place of the missile turrent. Finally, 2
sandcasters and 2 fusion guns have been added to the transport.
<P>If the troops are being sent to a 'low-threat' landing zone, the lasers,
sandcasters and additional fusion plant is removed, allowing 100 troops to be
sent rather than fifty.
