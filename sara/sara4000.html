<HR> 
 As an exercise (and to go with some starship designs I'm working on) I 
tried to design TL 9- (TL 9 without contragrav) ground-to-orbit shuttles.
It mostly worked, without breaking the FFS rules more than slightly.
The only major difference in fact was that I used the real delta-V
formula rather than the simplified FFS one
(see http://www.missouri.edu/~ccjoe/traveller/thrusters.html, especially the
article from cyhiggin@usa.pipeline.com, though her transfer orbit
formula looks wrong to me.) I did use FFS engines (see below.)
Ways in which the design changes with alternative rules, or CG, are also 
discussed at the end.<P>

TL-8 versions of these designs would look almost identical; if anyone is
really interested in the subtle differences I can post them.<P>

The one major difference to published TNE rules is of course the delta-V
to orbit. The TNE rule-book number-of-G-hours to orbit, as has been noted,
are completely wrong. Delta V from earth's surface to a 150km orbit
is 8.00 km/s. (Not 0.64 G-hours, which is 22.5 km/s.) Getting back
from orbit requires much less delta-V, too; all you have to do is
change your orbit so it scrapes the atmosphere more, and then aerobrake
(like the Space Shuttle does.) This raises total delta-V to 8.04 km/s.
If you start near the equator delta-V goes down; 7.64 km/s is the figure
I used, appropriate for a 30-degree inclination takeoff. 
For a size 9 world of normal density delta-V is 8.52 km/s, for a size 7, 6.72
km/s.<P>

These are delta-V in a vacuum and assuming very high instantaneous 
acceleration. Real atmosphere and gravity complicate this somewhat. 
FFS talks about non-CG spacecraft using 1-g of their thrust to negate 
gravity until they reach orbit, which is spectacularly nonsensical, even by GDW
standards. *Anything* that's moving is in an orbit; a thrown baseball is
in an orbit - just a *very* long and skinny elliptical orbit that 
happens to intersect the Earth's surface. The trick for a rocket is to
make sure your orbit never actually reaches the ground. For finite
accelerations this means some amount of delta-V is spent going upwards as the
spacecraft lifts off, which is less efficient than a pure Hohmann
transfer orbit. In addition, you lose delta-V due to atmospheric friction.
Together these add about 1.5 km/s to the delta-V requirements for a classical
rocket, and require that the takeoff acceleration be significantly higher
than 1G.<P>

The shuttle designs below are horizontal-takeoff designs which use their
airbreathing AZHRAE engines for takeoff and to climb to high altitudes
(and, in the case of the first design, for some extra delta-V.) This is similar
to the (now-cancelled) X-30 Aerospace Plane. This approach has been pretty
much abandoned in the real world, but FFS makes it easier to design than
most other single-stage-to-orbit designs (see below.) It also means that
the acceleration required of the engine is only 1G (or even less.) I've
allowed 0.6 km/s delta-V for remaining atmosphere drag (8.1 km/s round trip
to 150-km orbit from 30 degrees latitude), which is typical for the Pegasus
air-launched rocket. There's a huge range of operational parameter space for 
these vehicles depending on the atmosphere, density and diameter of the world 
they're operating on; I've designed for an Earthlike world.<P>

Terminology for those who don't have FFS: AZHRAE is the acronym
for a combination turbojet/ramjet/rocket engine. HRF is hydrogen
rocket fuel. HCD is hydrocarbon distillates (petrochemical fuels.)
EAPlaC is the incredibly efficient solid-rocket-like TL-9 engine in FFS,
normally used in missiles.<P>


FFS engines have low thrust-to-weight but also lower fuel consumption than
the Real World. This is actually an advantage for craft like this one which
have quite low accelerations. Using more realistic engines (see the URL
above) bites heavily into the payload; designs are available if anyone is
really interested.<P>

One can argue that craft that aerobrake should have higher armor values
than normal craft, but one can also argue that AV=1 and especially the
internal structure is far heavier than real world craft needed, so I've
just left it at AV=1.<P>


<h3>EAPlaC</h3>

   These designs don't use EAPlaC for a variety of reasons:
<LI> I started with the exploration shuttle, which needed to be completely
field-refuellable.
<LI> I wanted them to be basically practical at TL-8
<LI> I wanted the commercial shuttle to emphasize rapid turnaround, thinking
that this would decrease operations costs. (I was wrong.) 
<LI> Even though the rules implicitly assume EAPlaC rockets can be turned off
and re-ignited (unlike solid rockets in the real world), they're still a
type of solid, and no-one in their right mind uses solid rockets on a 
manned vehicle. (The NASA Space Shuttle is a case in point.)
<LI> EAPlaC is poorly-explained magic, not extrapolated technology.<P>

   However, EAPlaC has an *incredible* ISP. It's very tempting. If the safety 
considerations don't apply, TL-9 shuttles would probably at least use 
expendable strap-on EAPlaC boosters. A shuttle that gets part of its delta-V
4 ton (28 m^3) strap-on EAPlaC boosters can carry 390 tonnes into orbit at a
fuel cost of MCr 1; commercial shipping charges would be about Cr 2500 per 
tonne.<P>

   Additionally, pure EAPlaC unmanned rockets would almost certainly dominate
the bulk cargo market, where safety is irrelevant. A 100-ton unmanned 
disposable EAPlaC cargo carrier can carry 1280 tonnes into orbit, and costs
MCr 0.42! It's so cheap - dominated by fuel costs - that it's not even worth
reusing. Commercial cost to orbit would be about Cr 500 per tonne.<P>




<H3>The Real World</h3>

   In the real world, SSTO's are unlikely to look like this. Partially this
is because we don't know how to make an AZHRAE engine, and partially it's
because of various details like landing gear that FFS doesn't model.
Without AZHRAE engines horizontal takeoff has no advantages and in fact
is a net disadvantage, because you have to design the wings and landing
gear to lift the whole loaded weight of the spacecraft, not the empty weight.<P>

   Current SSTO paper designs are either VTHL (vertical-takeoff/horizontal 
landing) rocket takeoff/glide-landers, kind of like the Space Shuttle with no 
external  tank or boosters, or VTVL (vertical-takeoff/vertical landing) craft
which look a lot like 1950s science fiction and hover/land using thrust from
rocket engines (the DC-X and proposed follow-ons.) See sci.space.policy
and s.s.tech for perpetual debates as to which approach is better.
Neither works well with FFS engines. Also, a VTVL doesn't work very well
for a shuttle that starts in orbit - it has to land/hover while carrying 
all the (heavy) fuel it needs to get back into orbit. Realistic rather than
FFS engines are better for these high thrust-to-weight designs, but they're
still very hard to do (I suspect because the interior structure mass in FFS is
too high for small craft.)<P>

<h3>Notes</H3>
 This version is designed for field operations on unexplored worlds.
It's VTOL-capable (Using the VTOL aircraft rules, this adds 10% to the hull 
material volume, and requires a minimum acceleration of 0.5G, which the
turbojets satisfy.) The AZHRAE engine burns hydrogen in its airbreathing modes rather than 
hydrocarbons. Since hydrogen is so bulky, it's no longer efficient to use 
the AZHRAE engine for any delta-V beyond that needed for takeoff and landing,
but this makes the shuttle completely field-refuellable.<P>

The shuttle normally starts in orbit, carried by a starship. It de-orbits
(0.05 km/s delta-V) and aerobrakes, then glides towards a carefully pre-
selected landing site. It activates the turbojets for 5 minutes at
0.1 G (350 km/h) to find the landing site, then 3 minutes of hovering at
0.5 G for landing. Vertical takeoff uses another 2 minutes of 0.5 G, then 5.5 
minutes of full thrust are left to climb to altitude before firing the rockets.<P>

For field refueling the shuttle would carry down a fission reactor
(60 tons) and then a fuel refining plant, modified to refine both 
liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, and several fuel storage tanks.
Using some of its HRF tanks, and the cargo hold, for  plain liquid hydrogen 
the shuttle can carry 295 m^3 to a 150-km orbit.<P>

Operating purely as an aircraft (with the HRF tanks full of hydrogen
for the turbojet) it has an endurance of about one hour, plus a margin for 
vertical takeoff and landing.<P>

Since it only has one electronics operator, it can only operate a total of
two sensors or communicators at any time.<P>
