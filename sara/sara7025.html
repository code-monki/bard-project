As promised, here is the information I worked up while working the
Seeker information on the "400 ton far trader".  This ship, the
<I>Rossi Nante</I> is currently being used in my campaign and is modified
from the original stats published by Seeker Games.
<P>
During the Final War, factions of the Imperial shadow corps who were
loyal to Margaret found their old networks failing them.  Desperate
to forge new ties as quickly as possible, they decided to outfit
several vessels to do their covert intelligence work for them.
Finding usable vessels was getting very difficult as well, so they
turned to a small shipyard which the "company" had aquired some
years before, Seeker Grand Survey, to build the ships they needed.
Because of the increasingly hostile situation, the ships were to be
twice the size of normal far traders, so they could support more
weaponry.  But the spooks would not budge on one point.  These
vessels were to look as much like the <I>Empress Marava</I> class far
traders as was possible.  Within a matter of 18 months SGS pushed 16
vessels out of the five shipbuilding slips it owned when a daring
raid by Lucan's forces smashed the little shipyard.  Known survivors
of this class include the <I>Rossi Nante</I> now operating in Coalition
space, <I>By-Tor</I> operating in the wilds and now believed to be in
control of Guild forces, <I>Snow Dog</I> which is belived infected by an
unknown strain of Virus, and <I>Ghost of a Chance</I> which was last
reported operating in the Regency.
