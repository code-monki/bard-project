Originally layed down in 1184 the <I>Aries</I>-Class Patrol Cruiser was
originally designed as a single use system assault boat, designed with
one purpose and one purpose only.  To each bring 200 Marines from
Stonehaven's surface to the K'pinah Orbital Starport, the Marines were
to assualt the station, seize control and defend it from any viral
assault.  The operation was a complete disaster, the station was lost
and two of the original four <I>Aries</I>-Class Assault Ships were lost in the
ensuing blood bath, one to friendly fire.
<P>
The remaining <I>Aries</I> were quickly redesigned and out fitted for system
defence duties.  This refit included the removal of the troop bays and
replacing them with a pair of short range Particle Accelerators and the
addition of a midline mounted collapsable spin habitat.  Four more <I>Aries</I>
were hastilly constructed with these specifications, three of which
were lost securing the system.
<P>
By 1189 the people of Stonehaven were ready to secure the remainder of
the Stonehaven Cluster, a grouping of three stars barely inside Reavers
Deep.  The <I>Aries</I> were quickly refitted with J-1 Jump Drive's at the
expence of manouver fuel.  The <I>Aries</I>-Class Patrol Cruisers were born and  in 1189 six of them jumped into the neighbouring Aries system, for whom they were named, and quickly established space superiority over a small number of system bound Vampires.<P>

The <I>Aries</I> would eventually be outfitted with a larger Fission power
plant and HEPlaR manouver drives before finally reaching the end of
their useful life in 1195.<P>
