This is the final design iteration of the Aurora-Trybec-Eos-Fija Common
System Defence Boat (ATEF-SDB). This design study was started on
11/III/1201, in response to the greater threat from the wilds perceived
upon the loss of the 12 Traders. Whilst information received on the
follow-up missions downgraded the threat, it was decided to press ahead
with the program, in order to free up Jump-capable warships from the
systems planetary navies for recovery missions. With these missions being
supported by freelance and RC help, more manpower could be freed up to man
the <I>ATEF</I>s. In addition, as the vessels are largely TL-10 and 11, with a
large TL-9 Fusion Plant, in-system support is more economical, and thus
more ships can be put in service than would otherwise be the case.<P>

The go-ahead to manufacture the first two vessels in the series was given
on 01/IX/1201, though it seemed that they would be the only vessels in the
series to be manufactured, as political opinion on the member worlds of
the ATEF-SDB consortium saw the external threat to their worlds as
minimal. The Vampire attack on Nike Nimbus on 18/IV/1202 changed that
opinion. The order for a complete production run was signed on 10/V/1202.
The order is broken down for the individual worlds as follows :<P>

The extra unit at Aurora is assigned to the <I>ATEF</I>training centre, which
will be based at the orbital port. Here prospective crews and support
staff will be trained quickly and expertly in the operation and
maintenance of this formidable vessel.<P>

The ship is of ovoid form, the armoured hull displacing 400 dT. It matches
the 4G acceleration typical of the <I>Shukugan</I> SDB, with slightly less
duration. The problem of g-compensation, which the Auroran compensator can
only negate 2Gs of is dealt with by orienting the decks vertically with
respect to the thrust vector. When at action stations, the g-forces
experienced by the crew are well within standard tolerances. The ship has
a good sensor suite, and countermeasures, including decoys. Weaponry
consists of a 25 dT missile bay, which combined with the mfds is capable
of salvoing 8 missiles rapidly at a foe, from a stock of 27. All these
missiles are in ready-use cradles, meaning there is minimal loading time-
vital in a heavy combat. The bay is located near the base of the ship, to
ease re-supply on the surface. The secondary laser barbettes are located
on the centreline, and have a good power rating and rate of fire. At right
angles to these are the rapid-fire defence lasers, which are fired from
their own dedicated mfds, these are an acceptable offensive weapon at
close ranges. The mfds can also control the Barbettes, if the main
directors are engaged with missile firing. Sand turrets fill out the
defensive weaponry, one aft and the other forward, on opposite sides of
the hull. At a cost of just over 309.9 MCr, this ship delivers at least
twice the effectiveness of relic designs, for less than twice the price.
<P>
Nike Nimbus seems certain to be a future client, and her proximity to Eos
should prove helpful in supporting the vessels. One program associated
with the <I>ATEF</I>is the ATEF-SBS (Scout Base Support), which would make
maintenance easier at RC Scout Bases. This would enable Nike Nimbus,
Baldur and Lancer to operate the <I>ATEF</I>with ease. Another associated
programme is the ATEF-SILTS (Support Infrastructure in Lower Technology
Systems). This involves modular maintenance facilities that would enable
the <I>ATEF</I>to be easily supported in Systems of Tech Levels 7-9. Lucifer is
the only likely customer within the RC, but Teldora, Xezor and other
possible RC allies in the wilds are likely external customers. Officials
suggest that future clients could purchase up to 50 units.<P>

There are two production lines for the <I>ATEF</I>, one at Aurora Ship Building
and Design, the other at Dawn Construction, Trybec. Eos and Fija provide
components, mainly the tech 9 fusion plant, and also fit-out their own
vessels. The only externally supplied equipment in these vessels are the
sensors, MFDs and decoys, purchased from Aubaine.<P>

With the first prototype set to make it's maiden run in little over a
month, the safety of the Spinward Face of the Coalition will soon be
assured, freeing up manpower and vessels to ensure our community grows,
and survives.<P>
