The Lucifer-class destroyer escort is a common ship employed to
screen and support destroyers in the Old Imperial Navy. Heavily
armed and armoured for it's size, it was designed in response to
events in the forth Frontier War, where inadequate screening led
to some tactical Zhodani victories.<p>

It has the Imperial standard J-4 and G-6 manouvre, good armour
backed up with a sandcaster. It's weaponry consists of two
standard missile turrets, and two Instellarms LXR45 X-ray
barbettes. These are rapid-fire weapons, capable of firing off
a burst almost fourteen times a minute. Against ships of it's
own tonnage, it can often stop the target dead with one hit.
This fearsome potential has led the vessels to be nicknamed
'Fusion Gunners'.<p>

The ship has a reasonably ranged sensor suite, with a backup
passive array. A full EMM system, EMS jammers, and decoys make
the Lucifer a hard ship to touch.<p>

Accomodation is tight. Staterooms are provided for the 3 
officers, but the rest of the crew must share 8 rooms between
them. Often one of the command quarters is freed up to cope
with the overspill.<p>

In addition to escort duties, the Lucifer is employed on garrison
and patrol duties. It is often employed on detached duties as
well, as it's large cargo capacity allows it to function away
from support for a considerable time.<p>

Since the collapse this vessel has become the backbone of the
Regency Navy, providing a dependable vessel that can 'bring
back the goods' in the most dangerous situations.<p>

In the wilds, this ship is encountered less frequently, as a
military vessel only worlds which had naval facilities on them
pre-collapse usually posess them.<p>
