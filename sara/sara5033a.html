Editor's Note: This is an alternative design to Jon Goff's <a href="sara5033.html">design</A>. <P>
With the recent discussion of the <I>Fusilier</I>, I thought I'd drop in this, a
<cite>Brilliant Lances</cite> conversion of the RCS <I>Lancer</I> that I ran up a while back. To
my great amazement, it was possible to pack all the required systems into a
hull of the right size class, (with the exception of the folding passive
array's surface area, but I've always allowed the surface area calculations
some leeway.
 <P>
This conversions was based on very little data - the back of the BR card was
all I could find. But from that we know what weapons it carries, that it's
in the 6,200 to 6,560 ton range, and that there is limited manoevre fuel
available. Personally, I think putting an 8-hex active array on board was
daft - it represents about a seventh of the ship's procurement cost, but
it's on the card.
 <P>

The second of the Coalition's home grown destroyers, the RCS <I>Lancer</I> replaced
the Fusiler's particle accelerator with a Europa Starcracker 6.4 Gigajoule
meson gun, designed and built especially for the hull. It was hoped that the
meson gun would be more useful against ground targets, especially the
heavily armoured and often subterranean planetary defence assets remaining
to TEDs in the Wilds.
 <P>
The <I>Lancer</I> represented the cutting edge of the RC's shipbuilding
capabilities at the time of its launch. The majority of Aubaine's
shipbuilding industry was involved in the construction at some stage, as
many of the components were one-offs (or two-offs, in the case of components
common to the design of the Fusilier. As such, several aspects of the ship
were rather stretched to the limit - the fuel refining plant was notoriously
slow, the power plant was nearly a Gigawatt short of the ideal, and the ship
carried only 20.5 G-hours of fuel after a full-range jump.
 <P>
The nominal small-craft load was two 50-ton modular cutters, but one of
these was usually replaced with a few fighters or Fury class landers. The
ship was nominally capable of temporary conversion to the assault role, by
adding bunks and drop capsule launchers to the cargo bay. Theoretically up
to 100 troops could be carried in this way, although the conditions would be
far from ideal.
