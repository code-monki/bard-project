<i>Mureena</i> II-Class ("<i>Mureena</i>" is "Moray Eeel" in Anglic) was a pre- 
collapse export version of the Vyborgian <i>Mureena</i> SDB. <i>Mureena</i>-class was 
designed to be a long-range Laser/Missile platform, with adequate 
sensors, thrust and fuel endurance. Additional design requirement was 
the ability to lay low in atmosphere and underwater.
<p>
Because of the stealth requirements, the <i>Mureena</i> is shaped like a 
submarine: the hull is cylinder (5:1 L/W ratio) with rounded ends, and 
has elevated "conn tower" on top deck. The conn tower is shaped so that 
underwater <i>Mureena</i> can push the tower through thick ice while the rest 
of the ship remains underwater.
<p>
The ship has unusual auxiliary ducted fan thruster (twin rim-drive 
tunnel propellers), which generate 1 MN thrust in standard atmosphere 
(much more in water). These fans allow slow underwater and atmospheric 
manoeuvering (640 km/h) without using the highly visible HEPlaR 
thruster.
<p>
The main differences between <i>Mureena</i> I and II is that the M2 equipped 
with Imperial TL-15 weapons, meson screen and fuel purifier. The M1's 
original High-Automation control systems are also re-engineered into 
Imperial low-automation standards, so the M2 requires a crew of 54 (+10 
Mariners) instead of original 22 (+30 Jaegers).
<p>
Exported <i>Mureena</i> II SDBs were equipped with standard imperial socket 
weapons: 150 MJ tunable laser turrets, 50 cannister sandcasters and 
standard missile barbettes with 5 missiles each.
<p>
The original <i>Mureena</i> I SDBs were equipped with Solomani socket weapons: 
144 MJ x-ray laser turrets, 40 cannister sandcasters and either 
guided "SS-N-31 Sparte", semi-independent "SS-N-33 Swarm" or "SS-N-34 
Scramasax (AHEAD KKM)" missile barbettes.
<p>
Aurora Boriolis uses the same hull/sensor/socket suite for <i>Mureena</i>-class 
SDBs and Barracuda-class patrol cruisers.
<p>

The ship has many power-hungry components, but many of them are 
redundant and are likely to be turned off during combat. For example, it 
is highly unlikely that main thruster, auxiliary thruster and CG lifter 
would have to be operating at full power level simultaneously.
<p>
The sip is build in a world with Technology Profile: EE-EFFFF-EEEG-EE-G, 
so the only key component that had to be imported is the TL-15 Power 
Plant. (The 4.5 GW plant is a stock item manufactured in Aquitaine for 
Saxe Transport's <i>Palfrey</i>-class freight tug).
<p>
The HEPlaR thruster provides slightly more than 6G acceleration. This 
allows the ship to have full 6G acceleration even if all turret were 
fitted with heavier lasers.
<p>
Auxiliary Ducted fan provides 1000 kN thrust, and is used for low-speed 
maneuvering in atmosphere/hydrosphere.
(Ref Surf = 172.2 m2, Drag Coeff = 0.3, Air Density 1.225 kg/m3,
Thrust = 1 MN => Max Airspeed = 177.8 m/s = 640 km/h)
(Ref Surf = 172.2 m2, Drag Coeff = 0.3, Water Density 1000 kg/m3,
Propeller power = 40 MW => Max submerged speed = 11.6 m/s = 42 km/h)
<p>
Crew formulas did not require a sickbay, but it was included since the 
ship was intended for long-duration patrols.
<p>
Conn tower contains laser turret, 4-hex fixed PEMS, MFD sensors and 2 
air locks.
