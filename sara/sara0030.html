The <i>Eyeball</i> series of probes offered a means of observing over a wide area without danger to the parent ship. Ranging in size from 1dt to 3 dt, plus the larger 5dt Cyclops, they provided survey and scout ships with many additional functions.
Later versions of the probes were modified to provide even more capabilities, including personnel transport and some were even made jump capable.  
<p>The Alpha version was the most basic, displacing only 1dt and with a sensor package limited to only 2-hex Active and Passive EMS Arrays.
Manoeverability, as was common for the series, was impressive, with a top thrust of 8G and 56 g-Hours of fuel on board. Comms and control ran through a standard military maser link for security.
<p>EMM was fitted as standard, since this was primarily a military design, and the probes were even fitted out with Contra-Grav drives to assist operations in planetary gravity wells. Overall, the <i>Eyeball</i> series were a very successful and versatile range, although the Alpha was superceded by more useful units.
