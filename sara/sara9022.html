 The Keluin Republic government has announced that 
 they were accepting tenders to build a new class 
 of scout ships. All tenders are to for the 
 construction of the following design, which won 
 the Republic's Naval Architecture Department's 
 internal competition for the design.
 <P>
 This new class, tentatively named the <I>Vulpine </I>
 Scouts after a swift and stealthy Terran 
 predator, are intended to maximise use of the 
 AEMS systems recently salvaged from the hulk of 
 an old Solomani <A href="sara5006.html"><I>Scharnhorst</I> Class Heavy Cruiser</A>. 
 These will be allied with the passive EMS and 
 computer/control systems from the assortment of 
 Aslan vessels currently employed as in system 
 cargo haulers (mainly the <I>Khtukhao</I>-Class Clan 
 Transports). The first run of these new vessels 
 will be limited to three ships by the shortage of 
 these extremely high-tech components. In fact 
 these computers are so high-tech that they will 
 be installed by technicians on loan from Fulton 
 as part of the technology exchange program.
  <P>
 The <I>Vulpine</I>'s were designed as multi-role scouts 
 capable of preliminary system and planetary 
 surveys, including contact, if necessary. 
 Consequently they have an extensive sensor suite 
 of relic sensors. Because these electronics and 
 scout crews are too valuable to throw away the 
 vulpine's were also designed to be able to run, 
 or if that is impractical, fight. To this end 
 they are capable of 3G's acceleration, and have 
 enough fuel to perform a second J-2 jump without 
 refuelling if they have to. However only a 
 foolish crew would return to an insecure system 
 as this manoeuvre will leave the ship dangerously 
 low on fuel.
  <P>
 To aid in running the scouts are provided with 
 288 decoys, in an even mix of types. This is 
 sufficient for over an hour of evasion, or two 
 hours of straight acceleration.
  <P>
 For the fighting part the <I>Vulpine></I>'s are equipped 
 with a missile turret for the 4 m<sup>3</sUP> light 
 missiles, and a 150Mj laser barbette which is 
 fitted with the multiROF software update from 
 Fulton, which has become a standard. This program 
 allows the turret to switch from one 150MJ pulse 
 every 18 seconds to one 18.75MJ pulse every 2.5 
 seconds, plus several intermediate settings. 
 Originally intended for anti-missile duties this 
 software has proven popular with scouts forced to 
 deal with hostile dirt-siders. Coupled with the 
 1500km effective range that the laser displays 
 even in dense atmospheres this should provide 
 plenty of fire-support for any scout team that 
 get in trouble on-planet.
  <P>
 As scouting is more than just acting as a sensor 
 platform the Vulpines are to be built as 
 airframed wedges, capable of stealthy re-entries 
 and equipped with an air-raft for quiet scouting 
 of the countryside. They have accommodation for 
 up to six specialist staff without undue 
 crowding, though it is expected that a normal 
 mission profile will only require four. The 
 vessels will also be equipped with an extremely 
 large set of doors to their cargo bay - so large 
 that the bay can be used as a hanger for vehicles 
 up to the size of the pre-collapse <I>Pyrrhus</I> grav 
 support sled or a G-carrier, should the mission 
 require it (or the opportunity to recover one 
arise).<P>

For those of you that are unaware of this, Keluin 
is the TL11 capital of a small PE on the extreme 
rimward edge of the old Solomani Confederation, 
in the Canopus sector. Fulton is a TL14 member 
state of the PE that has only a 'B' starport, and 
has recently entered into an exchange program 
with Keluin. Fulton will help uplift Keluin to 
TL12+ and Keluin will help upgrade Fulton's 
starport to a type 'A'. This has not been met 
with universal approval on either world, as many 
businesses feel they will lose out with the loss 
of various monopolies.<P>
