<B>CONFEDINFONET, CLASS NEWSREPORT, DISTRIBUTION UNLTD AUTHORITY NIGHTRIM 
NAVEL COMMAND, TWILIGHT BASE, STONEHAVEN (2917/REAVERS DEEP, A9D5742-B) 
12/VI/1201
KEYWORDS: SCOUT/ COURIER, NNC, DARIUS ENGINEERING, MODIFICATION, ARTEMIS, 
STOCK SHARES</B><P>

With the announcement late this afternoon of Nightrim Navel Command's 
acceptance of the Darius Engineering Scout / Courier modification, stock 
prices in the once little known firm rose dramatically sending investors 
scrambling to acquire more shares.  The terms of the contract have yet to 
be announced; however, inside sources say that the deal is for the 
modification of five Scout / Couriers to the Artemis specifications by 
the end of the year, with a further ten to follow the following year.<P>

<UL>"Naturally we're all thrilled about the rise in stock prices, but the 
real victory here is yet to come.  We've got a lot of work ahead of us."<BR>
<UL>James Thornton, CEO Darius Engineering.</UL></UL><p>

Although the final performance statistics of the <I>Morrigan</I> are still 
classified inside sources have managed to provide us with the following 
information.<P>
 
The <I>Morrigan</I> is used by the Nightrim Confederation, a small pocket
empire located in Reavers Deep. The ship was designed using <i>Fire, Fusion
& Steel</I><P><BR>


  The Confederation of Nightrim has,  
due to it's general unsuitablity for missions into the Wilds,
decertified the S-Class Scout for anything other than milk 
runs.  Hence the Artemis, it was designed as a small, fast, long legged 
scrapper capable of holding it's own with larger vessels in the Wilds.  
It was designed as an armed exploration vessel for use by CNERS 
(Sinners).  With the abundance of S-Classes the Confederation 
decided that it might be 
cheaper and faster to recondition relic vessels and return them to 
forward duty than it would be to construct vessels from scratch.  The 
result of this program is the Morrigan.  The 
problem with the Morrigan is that the contractor building it is competing 
with the contractor of the Hecate for the S-Class's parts.

<B>Notes</B><BR>
<B>1)</B>  The <I>Morrigan</I> is also armed with a, pop down, TL13 Plasma Cannon and 
coaxial VRF Gauss.  The Plasma guns statistics are identical to those on 
the Phyrus with one exeption, it has 800 rounds of ammunition.  The Both 
the Plasma Gun and the VFR Gauss are controlled by the MFD operator and 
has advanced stabilization.<P>

<B>2)</B>  The Cargo Hold door is large enough to act as a launch port for a 3 ton vehicle (Grav Sled or Range Truck).  Cargo capasity drops to 35.698 
cubic meters if an adiquate hanger is allowed.  If not the cargo capasity 
is reduced to only 77.698 cubic meters.<p>

<B>3)</B>  If the <I>Morrigan</I> is intended as a conversion to the old S-Class Scout Courier, the cost of the conversions is, 74.845 Mcr.<P>

<B>4)</B>  Though there are no dedicated passanger cabins, the second small 
stateroom has a second bunk allowing for a single passanger to be carried 
without a loss of comfort.<p>
