In antebellum times, the Bwap Runabout was
given to Elder Guardians of the Tap-a-wewaka-atapas
(Guardians of Order), the enforcement arm of the Bwap
Council of Order.  Every Elder Guardian was assigned a
particular region of the Imperium that contained Bwap
creches, and was nominally in charge of enforcing
their races overriding Wepawab philosophy. The
Runabout is not manufactured by the Bwap themselves,
but it was a standard design kept on the books of many
antebellum era shipbuilding firms, as a courtesy to
the Newts. These ships are not available for any other
race, and Bwap Guardians often used force to prevent
their acquisition by pirates or swindlers.
<P>
The vessel is quite distinctive. It is Y-shaped, with
the front splitting apart horizontally at the front to
reveal staterooms enclosed behind massive bay windows.
The remainder of the shape is a tapering cylinder,
with the bridge amidships, in front of the sole turret
socket, and finally splitting into two nacelles, top
and bottom, containing the jump drive, that flank the
Heplar Drive. The lower nacelle also contains the main
cargo hold, and is equipped with a hatch large enough
to accomodate a small air raft or ATV. The vessel is
equipped with two airlocks, port and starboard, that
branch off of the bridge.
<P>
The Bwap normally have the Runabout manufactured at
TL-12 to make it as available as possible. The
interior of the ship is noticeably different from
normal human ships, as Bwaps are most comfortable at a
gravity of 0.8G and a very high relative humidity of
eighty to ninety percent. Because of this moistness,
fiber optic systems must be substituted for normal
computer and control systems, though these work out
rather nicely in combat as well.  A 28 cubic meter
"wallow" is provided for the Bwap crew in their off
time or during jump, and which has proven very useful
in the transport of aquatic sentients like Dolphins
and Githiaskio. The version detailed below is armed
with a 120 MJ TL-12 laser turret; in most cases the
ship is manufactured without armament, as this is
usually left up to the Elder Guardian's preference and
ability to afford.  In most cases the turret is left
unmanned, and is fired from the bridge by one of the
two manuever personnel. The MFD is usually fitted to
missle armed versions.
