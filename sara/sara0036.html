Designed to defend the Fulton system against marauders and vampires, FLNB
<I>Fulton </I>(FLNB means "Fulton League of Nations Boat") and her sisters were
intended to close rapidly to give their missiles maximum initial closing
velocity, launch a massive salvo, and then run away. It was hoped that
tactic, while expensive in monetary terms (a full 32 missile salvo costs
FultonMCR 40.32, or RMCr 42.84 in Republic Credits) would minimise losses
of valuable ships and crew, as well as disposing of the threat before it
attack civilian shipping, or other targets within the system. The downside
is that even with only a very minimal crew on watch it takes a full eight
hour shift for the rest of the crew to reload the missile bay from the
missile store. The secondary laser armament is impressively powerful, but
lacks the long range punch that a vessel of this sort really needs. While
plans were drawn up for a gravitic laser with better long range performance
it was felt that using an existing design would be cheaper, given
re-training considerations, etc. While not designed with anti-missile work
in mind the lasers have had this capacity upgraded by a software
modification that allows them to fire up to eight times as fast as normal
(ROF800 vs ROF100) by reducing the power of each shot to 'only' 81.25MJ,
while retaining the original range, etc. This feature is also useful for
dealing with spreads of small craft and light armoured vehicles, and is
thus being retro-fitted to all lasers of this model.
<P>
The few serious incidents the <I>Fulton</I>'s have been involved in have shown
that the missile salvos are very useful, but that they require fine
judgement by the commander particularly when there is more than one target,
as firing too many can leave the vessel vulnerable, and is wasteful, while
firing too few weakens future salvo and makes it too easy to defend
against. This is probably the biggest weakness of the class - that to be
used to their full potential they need a good deal of information about
their target of a type that they are unlikely to have, given the nature of
their role and their likely targets.
<p>
Despite having reactor fuel for a year the <I>Fulton</I>'s were never intended to
operate away from a base for more than a month or so, and as a result they
have no on-board machine shops and no fuel purifier, forcing them to return
to base when their reactor fuel runs low. They are also a bit cramped (all
crew are two to a room) However less <I>Fulton</I>'s were completed than was
originally planned (nine as opposed to twelve), due to the diversion of
yard capacity towards building in-system freighters to meet the demands of
renewed exploitation of the system's two planetoid belts. As a result more
volume has had to covered by less boats, meaning that patrols have got
longer and longer, to the detriment of boats and crews alike.
<p>
This class of boats is equipped with a launch, because despite the
relatively short patrol envisioned when they were designed it was felt that
it would be useful if they could send a detail to investigate anything odd
they might come across e.g. pre-Virus hulks. Having a launch means this can
be done without risking the MB without needing specially trained Marines
and extended EVA suits, etc. This design decision has not been without its
critics, however. Most of these critics advocate removing the docking ring
and flight crew quarters to make space for more fuel, however most Naval
observers don't think that it's worth the 2 odd G-turns of extra endurance
it would give.

Total Fuel Tankage: 5032.8 m3 (359.5 tons) <BR>
Fuel scoops (10% of ship surface), fills tanks in 1.1 hours<BR>
79 MW power shortfall, usually made up by leaving the CG unit off (in
atmosphere by reducing power to the AEMS, jammer, MFDs and/or leaving 1
laser unpowered).	<BR>
