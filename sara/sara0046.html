<HR>
The <I>Gargoyle</I> BR was originally designed to
be the companion piece for the Third Imperiums
controversial <I>Gishikimega</I> class Light Cruiser. Unlike
most battle rider and tender combinations, the 30,000
dton <I>Gishikimega</I> was intended to be a main battle
unit, with its five <I>Gargoyle</I> riders escorting and
screening it into the heat of battle. The idea of
using the tender as more than a largely helpless
support unit ran against the strong tide of
conventional thinking that always stifled the Imperial
Navy, and only half of the intended class ever reached
production due to bureaucratic stonewalling.
<P>
The combination recieved its baptism of fire during
the Solomani Rim War, and acquited itself rather well
against light Solomani fleet elements. Nevertheless
the design was a political orphan, and went out of
production in 1023.  Most of the class was banished to
outlying frontier areas, and a good number of them
ended up in the Domain of Deneb.  Several served in
the Fourth and Fifth Frontier Wars with distinction,
where the shortage of new line units forced the Domain
naval command to deploy them in spite of their
prejudice. Both ships were still in service by the
time of the Civil War and the Collapse, and served
with distinction against Virus.
<P>
The strategic value of small battle riders in the
defensive role became clear after the Rape of Trin.
The Regency Navy decided that employing large numbers
of 1k to 10k ton riders in place of traditional SDBs
in critical systems bordering the Wilds would would be
more effective against large Vampire incursions. The
<I>Gargoyle</I> was one of several BR classes rushed back
into production, but the cheapness of producing the
class meant that its construction would outstrip the
supply of available Gishikimegas. With no other
recourse the Navy modified a number of older frigate,
escort and destroyer vessels to act as carriers, and
who would supplement the BRs firepower with their own.

<P>
The vessel has an unusually large cargo hold, the
result of a design specification for local
customisation. The vessel is designed with a minimum
level of embedded firepower, with local commanders
filling out the balance of the vessel as they saw fit.
This was not only intended to provide ships to order
for local conditions, but also to inject a level of
uncertainty by randomising each ship's combat
abilities and making their actual equippage
unpredicatble.
