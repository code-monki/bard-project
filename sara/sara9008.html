In the Regency Navy, knowledge is power, and the ability to quickly transmit
and convey information can mean the difference between a conflict averted, a
conflict won and a conflict lost.  The Type S6 Long Range Courier is
designed with this maxim in mind - to transmit information as quickly as
possible.<P>

The Type S6 crams a Jump-6 drive and fuel tankage for two consecutive jumps
into a standard Scout/Courier hull, allowing a twelve parsec journey to be
completed in 15 days (a full day is allowed between jumps in non-emergency
situations for diagnostics and routine maintenance on the jump drive).  Fuel
scoops and purification machinery allow a third jump to take place in as
little as 12 hours (the remainder of the fuel can be processed while the
ship is in j-space).<P>

Naturally, the drive to extend the Type S6's range has led to some
sacrifices.  The ship carries no weaponry - even the hardpoint socket has
been removed to fit in more fuel.  The ship also has limited endurance in
normal space, with only 22 G-turns (without jump fuel), the Type S6 is not
expected to do much more than head directly to it's destination upon
emerging into normal space.  Only three crew are present - one maneuver
officer also doubles as the ship's electronics officer, although there is a
dedicated engineer on-board.  Crew accommodations allow four a single
passenger to be carried if required.<P>

In times of conflict, the Type S6 is expected to jump into the outer system,
far beyond reach of planetary defenses, and jump out after burst-tranmission
of it's data cargo to Naval assets in-system.<P>

The Type S6 (aka <i>Uiderfowl</i>, after a migratory bird found on Lysen) was
designed by Fremantle Shipyards in 1197 in response to RFT-1195-110 (a
Request For Tender issued by the Regency Navy in 1195).  The first Uiderfowl
was launched on 014-1199, and was commissioned into the Navy in 1200.  After
extended trials, the type entered regular service in 1201, and an extended
production run is anticipated.<P>

To date, 70 examples have been ordered:  22 of these are to be produced at
Fremantle's Number Three yard on Jewell, the remainder will be manufactured
under license throughout the Regency.  The <i>Uiderfowl</i> is not exepected to
be offered on the civillian starship market.  A number of these will be
conversions from existing Type S hulls, Fremantle Shipyards is preparing a
conversion kit to assist manufacturers.<P>
  
After entering regular service in 1201, eight examples of the <i>Uiderfowl</i>
are currently in service.  Two have been attached to the RQS, and are in
service in Quarantine District 5A as part of RQS peacekeeping duties in The
Islands.<P>

<h3>VARIANTS</h3>

Althought no known variants are in service, Fremantle Shipyards is working
on a number of variants which will be offered to the Navy.  The Type
S6-ELINT will feature an improved passive EMS array, as well as additional
sensor suites and will be used to gather electronic intelligence in
potentially hostile systems.  The improved sensors comes at a cost of
reduced flexibility - the S6-ELINT sacrifices fuel purification
capabilities, instead relying on it's existing fuel tankage to jump directly
into and out of target systems from a support base.  Fremantle is also
believed to be negotiating with Ling Standard Products Advanced Systems
Division on Mora to produced an improved TL-16 version of the S6.<P>
