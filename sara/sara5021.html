The <I>Wolf</I> Class Destroyer is a design to take the battle to the enemy.  For
too long have we hidden behind the borders of quarantine, and now that we
are looking outside these borders again we need a ship capable of hunting
down Virus controlled ships and destroying them.  The <I>Wolf</I> Class Destroyer
is the ship which will allow us to finally get our revenge.<P>

The primary feature of this design is its maneuverability.  With four
parsec jump engines these ships have been designed to respond in numbers to
any reports of Virus shipping.  Operating in packs of three to four ships
these ships should be able to patrol a large area of space for months at a
time, and deal with any but the very largest of Vampire fleets, and even
those they should be able to disrupt until help can arrive.  Their
maneuverability doesn't stop there though.  With almost six full hours of
fuel at an acceleration of six standard gravities, without cutting into its
jump reserves, these ships should be able to engage their opponents for far
longer than most other designs.<P>

Once you add to this, the designs formidable array of both offensive
and defensive features it soon becomes apparent this is a ship
designed to deal damage, but not to receive it.  With twelve
sand-casters, an array of point defense lasers large enough to keep
off a barrage of missile fire, a thirty-two mega-watt meson screen,
and a large stock of decoys, these ships are more than capable of
surviving even the heaviest of combats.  The designs primary weapon is
its massive fourteen thousand mega-joule particle accelerator, capable
of forcing a reset on the computers of unhardend ships, and of such
power that a single hit will take most small combatants out of the
picture permanently.  This is backed up by the point defense lasers
which can be used at close range to penetrate even the densest of
armour, and a series of missile barbettes largely to add flexibility
to the designs armament.<P>

Other features of the ship include full workshops to carry out any repairs
that do become necessary, a fuel purification plant capable of refining
enough fuel to keep the engines going at over four gravities for as long as
the ship can obtain raw materials, a fifty displacement ton auxiliary
vessel as a life boat, and a seven hundred cubic meter combined cargo area
and briefing room.  The briefing room area should also help to relieve the
otherwise cramped conditions on board with most of the crew sleeping two to
a small stateroom for months at a time.<P>

The only problem we can see with this ship is the slight delay whilst
waiting for construction due to the requirement for the latest design
control and power systems, but since without these the ship would have to
be significantly enlarged to hold the larger power plants, and all the
additional crew needed to run them, we feel this design decision wasn't so
much of a decision as a necessity.<P>

It is time to move back to the stars we once owned, and this is the ship to
protect us whilst we are doing it.<P>
