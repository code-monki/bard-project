The <I>Wyvern</I> SDB was designed to provide a formidable defender of Imperial
Naval assets.  The <I>Wyvern</I> is designed to intercept and destroy enemy
targets long before they get near friendly assets.  The boat has
6Gs of acceleration which should allow it to close with hostile targets
and to dictate where the fight takes place. It is armed with a power
battery of laser weapons. These are linked together and focus a
terrific amount of energy on a single target.  To defend against
attacks, the <I>Wyvern</I> is equipped with a decent amount of armor, more
was desired, but the weight of the extra armor, drastically increased
the amount of thrust required of the Heplar plant and drove the cost up.
In addition to armor, the <I>Wyvern</I> is equipped with 5 state of the
art sandcasters, to protect against PAWS, Lasers and Missile blasts.
It also mounts 10 half ton point defense lasers, which can shoot
down incoming missiles or fighters and at short range can do as
much damage as the standard TL-15 150 MJ laser turret. It also mounts
a very large Meson screen, which should neutralize meson guns of all
but the largest ships. It also has a standard EMM system and 600 decoys
to prevent target lock ons.  To further decrease the chance of 
enemy ships locking on to the <I>Wyvern</I>, it is equipped with a 300,000km
EMS jammer and a 180,00km Area Jammer. <P>

The <I>Wyvern</I> is equipped with 300,000km meson communicator, which allows
it to keep in constant contact with its base, even while lurking in a 
gas giant.  <P>

The <I>Wyvern</I> doesn't carry sick bays, or shops. It is expected that the
naval installation which the <I>Wyvern</I> is assigned to can provide these
faciliites. The <I>Wyvern</I> has a small 10 ton hangar, to accomadate small
crafts carrying crew replacments, cargo and other supplies. The standard
procedure is to base the small craft out of the Naval base.<P>

The <I>Wyvern</I> is a very sleek and stream-lined design.  It is formed from
a central disk and two smaller disks, which are mounted to each side
of the central disk.  The large 100 Ton laser bay is mounted on the
bow of the central disk.  Four PD lasers are mounted on each wing disk
and two are mounted on the central disk.  <P>
