 The Hive Federation deploys this ship as the primary Fighter Carrier
 for Convoys to the Reformation Coalition and wherever a Naval Presence is
 required.  Constructed from the same hull design as the CL-IXa class Light
 Cruiser, the LC-IIIa was an economy design, a manipulation from the 
 Naval Procurement Topical Club. The primary goal of the manipulation
 was to prove the theory of M. Gualee (a noted Hiver Navy Manipulator) that
 the same hull as the the Light Cruiser (which was still being "debated"
 among the Naval Procurement Topical Club) would be usable as a Light
 Carrier.  At the same time, he progressed along several manipulations for
 the Naval Appropriations Topical Club and the Fleet Tactics Topical Club,
 including the inclusion of the same meson screen generator of the CL-IXa.
 Some claim that there's a further manipulation of the Federation Navy's
 highest circles, but that remains unproven and M. Gualee has kept its
 opinion to itself.<P>
    In addition to the hull, the parallel mount NPAW of the CL-IXa is also
 used (the product of a manipulation of M. Thuran, a junior assitant of
 M. Gualee). The record shows that Gualee originally pushed for a meson gun
 to replace the NPAW for the Post Collapse Light Carrier Manipulation, but
 Thuran was able to convince the Fleet Tactics Topical Club about the
 uselessness of such a small meson gun.<P>
    The fighter complement is the primary armament of the LC-IIIa.  36
 F'naah Class Heavy Fighters, 60 S*kfani Class Medium Fighters and 12
 Bark*ktonye Class Light Fighters are carried.  Organized into squadrons of
 6 Fighters, there are 18 total squadrons carried, used for a variety of 
 missions and roles.<P>
    In addition to the 240 pilots, there are 18 fighter mechanics manning 
 the 3 machine shops and 3 electronic shops of the Carrier.  There are 50 
 pilots and 10 mechanics carried in low berths for emergency situations.  
 Since these are Ithklur, they can substitue as Ships Troops or Marines, if
 necessary.<P>
    An additional 110dt of assorted small craft are carried as well as
 well as  staterooms for the Chief Convoy Manipulator and the Fleet Tactics
 Manipulator.  The 12 GJ Parallel Mount NPAW is designed to give the
 carrier the ability to defend itself against escorts and destroyers as well
 as annihalate the smaller Vampire and utilize the EMP effects.<P>
    Federation Naval doctrine demands that the carrier be deployed with an 
 escort of at least a Destroyer Squadron, though the carriers are usually
 at least paired with Light Cruiser CL-IXa.  With less than 1/3 of the armor
 of the CL-IXa and only capable of 2Gs of acceleration, the LC-IIIa is not
 designed for heavy engagements.  SOP calls for jumps of less than 2 parsecs
 into insecure space so that an escape jump may be made should opposition be
 heavy enough to threaten the carrier itself.  In situations that warrant,
 this will occur after the fighters have been deployed in which SOP leaves
 the (Ithklur) Wing Commander in operational command of the Federation
 fighters.<P>
