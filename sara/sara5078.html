This ship was constructed with TL 13
Enhanced SD armor (AV=18, 15 tons) adapted from Harold
Hales alternative materials list. See
http://www.myhelliconia.freeserve.co.uk/trav/rules/material.htm
for more information.
<P>
The Crusader was first constructed for the Imperial
Navy in the early 940s, and was distributed throughout
the Third Imperium. The ship was unusual in that it
carried four 57.6 GJ Parallel N-PAWs as its main
armament. This made up for its light armor and its
moderate acceleration. The cross-like mounting is what
gave the ship its name, as did its baroque armor
arrangement, which evoked armored knights in its
design. Because of the deadly range of N-PAWs versus
weak armor levels at these tech levels, fleet battles
revolve less around massed setpiece battles than
slashing raids, ambushes and long range sniping.
<P>
After about fifty years of service, which included
action against the Zhodani during the Third Frontier
War, the ship was downgraded and moved into the
reserve fleets. Hundreds of these ships ended up with
the fleets of the Solomani Autonomous Region, and were
used against the Imperium during the Rim War. After
the war the type continued to be manufactured by both
sides for their reserve and planetary navies. When the
Imperial Final War erupted in 1116, it was again
caught in the crossfire, and as the war deepened into
attrition, replaced lost frontline units in both
fleets. Aslan Naval and Quarantine units have
reportedly destroyed scores of these ships, in the
colors of both states, and captured several more that
serve within the Riftspan Theater. In the Regency the
ship is still a mainstay of several reserve fleets,
and a number of client states deploy the craft as
well.
