<B>Pre-Collapse:</B> The <I>Sundowner</I>-Class Free Trader was a 
common sight in the 
Solomani Confederation.  It was 
the standard tramp freighter hauling freight on the fringes and 
to worlds far off the beaten path.  It carried freight and 
passengers between the various member states, and between 
individual worlds.<P>
    
<B>New Era:</B> Four of these craft are known to exist in RC 
space, all  four are owned by 
<A HREF="../icis/icis0000.html">Transstar</A>; the <I>Hokka</I>,
<I>der Krieger</I>, the <I>Zauberer</I>, and the <I>Skakac</I>.  
<A HREF="../icis/icis0000.html">Transstar</A> was able to store 
these ships through the collapse, and once contact was made with 
the Hiver, they were able to buy new parts, and start flying them 
again.  To prevent Virus from taking over, the controls were 
redone, and an additional engineer is stationed aboard. To make 
room for the extra workstation, the engineer's fresher and storage 
closet were converted into workspace.  The new workspace isn't 
very pretty, and the junior engineer on board is assigned to the
"Head station."<P>

<B>Solomani Space:</B>  Ships of this class were found throughout 
Confederation space, and many are sure to survive in places like 
the 
Near Bootes Confederation, the 
Terran Republic, and the 
League of Dingir. See <A HREF="../bardperi.html">PERI</A> for more details on these Empires. The Terran Republic and the League of Dingir are listed under Children of Earth.<P>
