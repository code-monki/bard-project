When we at Apogee Ship Design first started to design a Far Trader to
replace the venerable <I>Jayhawk</I>, we first looked at ways we might
improve the design to make it a better trader.  However we soon
realised that very few major improvements could be made over the basic
design of the <I>Jayhawk</I>, forcing us to step back and rethink the aims
of our design.  This lead us to the conclusion that the main failing
of most Far Traders currently available is their survivability, and
this lead us to design the Iguana.<P>

These are dangerous times, particularly beyond the borders of the
Coalition, so the Iguana has been designed to survive, even at the
cost of its cargo.  The Iguana's first line of defense against any
would be attackers is its standard sandcaster turret, and laser
barbette capable of giving almost all similarly sized ships second
thoughts.  If that doesn't prove sufficient then the Iguana is still
capable of turning tail and running.  Since the Iguana's cargo is held
externally, in two large fifty displacement ton cargo modules
specifically designed to fit the Iguana, these can be dropped to
improve the performance characteristics of the ship, doubling its
acceleration and improving its jump capability to allow a three parsec
jump, or an emergency one parsec jump on less than one hundred litres
of fuel.<P>

Another advantage the Iguana has over its competition is its
flexability.  Since the individual captain can determine the type of
modules he purchases for his ship he can decide whether to make it a
pure cargo hauler, or a passenger liner, or a mix of the two.  The
modules can also be used to make loading and unloading the ship
faster, since they each contain contra-grav lifters, and enough
batteries to maintain the contra-grav, life support and artifical
gravity for over an hour, they can easily be moved about the starport
to positions where they are easier to unload.  It would even be
possible for a group of Free traders to form a cooperative and
purchase several extra modules allowing even more rapid turn around
times.<P>

It should be noted that we recommend that no captain ever use a module
from an unrecognised source.  Whilst we have made every effort to
prevent Virus infection from a compromised module, the designers will
take no responsibility for any captain who accepts a module which has
been infected by Virus.  The anti-virus methods employed to prevent
this kind of infection can basically be split into three sections,
voluntary conection, limited connection, and isolation.  The first
ensures that no connection can be made between the ship and the
modules until a switch has been thrown on both sides.  This will then
connect the module to a disposable "canary" until the ship's switch is
thrown again.  The second is a very limited protocol on the limited
connections between the ship.  If any variance is detected on either
the power, or contra-grav control line, these connections will be
broken off. The third guard is that both these connections are
isolated inside the ship, in particular the power connection is to a
small self contained 21MW fusion plant.<P>

The only problem with using the Iguana in the replacement ship scheme
is its relative cost, but this could be offset fairly easily by
retaining part ownership of the ship when exchanging it.  A fifteen to
twenty percent share would probably not be seen as too excessive by most
Free traders bringing in old ships for new, and would bring immediate
material gain to the Coalition.<P>

The Iguana is fairly uninteresting to look at, a blunt nose slopes
back to a slightly rounded box, about nine meters wide and high, and
almost eighteen meters long, disturbed only by the large indented
rectangles the modules sit in.  Under the nose is the entrance to the
small vehicle bay, whilst above it is the cockpit.  Behind the vehicle
bay is the ships internal fuel tanks, and above that the crew quaters,
and the cross corridor which connects to the two hatches the modules
connect to.  Further back the barbette sits mounted on the centre line
of the ship and dorsally mounted. Just behind that is the ventrally
mounted sandcaster, and behind these the engine room.  Finally,
between the jump drive and the engines themselves, below the engine
room is an airlock, exiting the port side of the ship.<P>

The modules themselves vary little in their appearance, being
themselves slightly rounded boxes, a little over seven meters square
and fourteen meters long, and with a hatch centrally on each side, and
one underneath to allow for later designs to carry them piggy back.
The only difference is the modules designed to carry cargo have a
large cargo hatch at one end, and those designed to carry passengers
have an airlock.  Which end this is, is up to the captain when he
connects the module.<P>

<B>Notes</B><P>

It is virtually impossible for the ship to collect modules again after
they have been dropped, however it is possible for a ship with
grapples, or a large enough hanger to recover them.<P>

A larger version is currently being designed with a main body of two
hundred tons, and able to connect to four of the modules, to exchange
for the ex-subsidised merchants and liners still in use.  However this
project had been put on hold whilst finishing the Iguana.  Further
details will be forthcoming.<P>

A second version that's still at the concept stage is of a 'Lancer
varient of the main body with upgraded weapons, sensors, and
maneuverability, that could be sold to 'Lancers and used for covert
missions.  These ships would look essentially identical to the Iguana
(or the larger version if it's decided the Iguana isn't large enough),
and could even use the same modules, and thus appear as a normal
trader.  With this in mind all the modules have internal bracing to
allow up to 3G maneuvering.<P>
