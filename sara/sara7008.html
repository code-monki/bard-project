The <i>Goshawk</I> is an early version of the ubiquitous Far Trader.  It was
originally designed near the dawn of the Third Imperium, but did not meet
with popular approval.  It was only when the ship was redesigned as the
Jayhawk, that the ship became somewhat popular, but by that time, the
<i>Empress Marva</I> class was available, and the Jayhawk/Goshawk was regulated 
to a second class nature.  The <i>Goshawk</I> and  <i>Jayhawk</I> are identical in
 peformance, it is only in outward appearence that they differ.  The <i>Goshawk</I>
is rather more bulky looking, with protruding tail fins, which serve no other
 purpose, than to make the ship look exceedinly silly.<P>

The ship is rather maintence hungry, while in jump space, much of the crew's tim
e is spent in upkeep of the ship.  The standard configuration of the ship is to 
have one sandcaster, but this can be switched for another weapon if desired. The
 electronics officer controls the sandcaster, but if a weapon is installed, a gu
nnery officer should be hired.<p>

The ship was designed using SSDS as presented in Starships.<p>
