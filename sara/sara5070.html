With its lack of armament, sensors, armor and speed, perhaps the easiest and
most attractive target for a Vampire in Regency space is the Tech-15 400 ton
subsidized merchant [see RSB p.87 for original specs]. It is therefore
entirely appropriate that a number of these vessels be converted to Q-ships.
<P>
            In order to lull Vampires into a false sense of security it is
important that a Q-ship match as closely as possible the specs of a hapless
Fat Trader especially as far as power plant emissions are concerned. The
current dearth of shipyard capacity also dictates the least amount of
renovation possible. To these ends, the design team proposes installation of
interior bulkheads on selected Fat Traders to create two 25-ton autoloaded
three-tube missile bays (one pointed forward and the other pointed aft) on
the cargo deck. Additional proposed weaponry includes a remote-fired 210 Mj
gravitic-focussed x-ray laser turret and a manned sandcaster turret. In
support will be installed a redundant self-contained commo suite with a
workstation and a canary, an additional dual-capable MFD with work
station, two normal workstations, and decoy dispensers.
<P>
            The increase in crew size dictated by the modifications can be
accommodated by a corresponding decrease in passenger capability. The
increase in power demands dictated by combat can be accomplished by powering
down lifters, fuel purification, and redundant electronic systems.
<P>
            Operational doctrine anticipates that the Vampire will approach
the Q-ship not vice versa. The Q-ship therefore goes about its business
exactly as would an ordinary merchant except that all communications occur
through the self-contained commo suite with the adjunct  canary .  When the
canary peeps  upon the probing approach of a Vampire, RQS auxiliary
personnel go operational; at the optimum range the vesselï¿½s bow clamshell
doors and rear cargo ramp open to release a deadly swarm of missiles while
heavy laser fire simultaneously douses the intruder.
<P>
            The design team believes that the consequent achievement of
surprise will outweigh the inherent limitations of this ship class thereby
enabling a massive increase in potential defensive platforms available to
the Regency. While the decrease in cargo and passenger capacity for vessels
thus outfitted will be significant, a slight boost in subsidy payments will
be sufficient to compensate shipping companies especially in view of the
fact that the present crisis (1140) calls for drastic measures.
