The Athenian Class Trader is the first ship design by the Auroran firm
of E.P. Aquana and Offspring. It was designed for the first RCSA ship
design competition, for a survivable Wilds Trader that would be
attractive to Free Traders. We liased with many Free Traders and
Coalition Corporations as to their 'ideal' small trader, and this is the result.<P>

The hull is of 250 displacement tons, a bit larger than ordinary
traders. Then again, those traders were designed for the Old Imperium,
not the Wilds. Of disc configuration, it catches the eye because of
many features, firstly it's airframe design. If this ships contragrav breaks 
down in the wilds it is still capable of safely refueling at gas giants
and landing. It also has a beefed up internal structure - to counter
turbulence and to enable the ship to set down at sea under stormy
conditions - Waterworlds are no obstacle to this ship. As one gets
closer something peculiar is noticed - it has three large cargo
hatches. The fact is that one of these 
hatches is for the passenger pod that is carried near the front of the
ship. A Free Trader wishing to run cargo can purchase the ship without
the pod, and lug lucrative items about in the 73 displacement ton hold
- almost as impressive as that of a Subsidised Merchant. Anyone wishing
to run a mixed load just leaves it in, cutting cargo to 53 tons, but
adding staterooms for 9 more medium passengers. Other pods are being
designed, including a 19 berth low passenger pod, a shop pod, a lab
pod, and a vehicle pod. If the owner wants to carry more pods he can, 2
more can be fitted behind the other cargo hatches. This does 
however leave the remaining 13 tons of the bay inaccessable. These pods
are built to TL-8 standards, meaning they can be built and supported at
a large amount of facilities in the Coalition - and the Wilds. One last
thing might catch your eye before you enter the ship - at the end of
the wing root, a small 'pepperpot'. This is the dispenser for the
ship's decoys - 15 carried in each dispenser. It adds about 3/4 of a
million credits to the price of the ship - but 
they'll help bring her back safe.<P>

While going inside you'll notice the thickness of the hull, armoured to
a reasonable level. The hull is also constructed to TL-8 standards to
allow it to be manufactured at any of the Coalition's shipyards. The
power plant is designed to TL-10 standards and the comms to TL-9 for a
similar reason. Looking around it seems much like any other ship, but
unlike most ships this one comes with weaponry installed. One AurTech
TL-11 80Mj Laser sits at the apex of the ship. This reliable weapon is
overpowered so it can fire off a shot every 20 
seconds - handy if some Teddie's fired a couple of missiles at you
whilst you're running for the Jump radius. An Eosian Sandcaster fills
out the weaponry in the dorsal position. A small hangar fills out the
requirements for owners that want a air raft. After that there's
nothing else to say about the ship - it hauls cargo, people, and will
get you there and back safely. Simple. It's flexiblity, with it's pod
design, ensures that no matter what the economic climate in our 
Coalition in the future, the Athenian will be making good money in it.<P>

The design firm liased closely with The Hellenic Trading and Transport 
Corporation, a Balduri Company. As the company's roots were in a L'steichan 
nation which drew it's roots back to Greece they though 'Athenian' was an 
appropriate name (and it might get more orders off the HTTC!).
