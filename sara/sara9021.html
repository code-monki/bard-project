The <I>Pathfinder</I> Multimission Scout is the newest design by KeeEEka Strongwall Shipyards
on Aubaine.  It is a small compact ship capable of performing a wide variety of
missions.  It has a 40 ton pod bay which accepts the same pods as the <I>Victrix</I>
multimission sloop.  KeeEEka Strongwall has also designed several new pod designs which
increase the range of missions for both the <I>Pathfinder</I> and the <I>Victrix</I>.
<P>
The <I>Pathfinder</I> is capable of Jump-2, but has sufficient fuel for an additional jump-1.
(It actually has enough fuel capacity for two succesive Jump-2, but that would require
that no gturns were spent, which is very difficult.)
<P>
The <I>Pathfinder</I> is built for life in the Wilds. It is armed with a potent 400 Mj laser
lance.  The lance should give the <I>Pathfinder</I> sufficient firepower to fight off the small
armed traders normally fielded by TEDs and pirates.  The ship does not neglect defense
either.  It has 30 decoys, a state of the art Electromagnetic Masking package and a 33
MW AEMS jammer.  These defensive features account for a third of the price of the TL-12
equipment.
<P>
The <I>Pathfinder</I> is no stranger to the atmosphere.  Its airframe construction give it
maneuverability to evade surface to air missiles and hostile aircraft; a normal
streamlined design would be a sitting duck.   For ground missions, the ship comes with a
<I>Buster</I> Weapon Carrier (RCEG pg 127) built on Lucifer.  This gives the crew the ability
to move out and explore the planet.  The <I>Pathfinder</I> is equiped with a Squad Support
Laser in case the natives turn hostile and a hot exit is required.  The Laser is mounted
in a belly remote turret and is controlled from the astrogator's console.  The
astrogator also operates the decoys and jammer, while the pilot operates the laser
lance.
<P>
If a mission turns bad and the crew takes casualties, the <I>Pathfinder</I> carries an
emergency low berth where four critically injured patients can be carried.  A mechanical
shop is also installed to manufacture any critical parts that might break down.
<P>
The <I>Pathfinder</I> has three tons of cargo space.  This space is adjacent to the engineering
section and machine shop.  The cargo bay has power conduits and cable conduits
installed.  Also the hull surrounding the hold does not have any structural members.
The design was done this way to allow the easy customization of the cargo hold.  It
could be coverted to a vehicle bay, a plasma cannon for ground support, additional
sensors etc.  For further room, the machine shop could be removed and the space utilized
for something else.  The hold  is normally sectioned off from engineering by a metal
roll up door.
 <P>
Each <I>Pathfinder</I> uses three TL-15 standard computers and controls, and a 456 MW fusion
power plant scavenged from a <I>Lord Baltimore</I> Yacht.  This comes to 33.217 MCr of relic
equipment per ship.  If TL-12 computers are installed instead, the  crew expands to 2
Manouver, 1 Electronics, 5 Engineers and 1 Command.  Also two tons of cargo space have
to be converted to workstations.  The ship can not reasonably use a TL-12 power plant.
KeeEEka Strongwall has managed to purchase the several salvaged <I>Lord Baltimore</I>  Yachts,
the Yachts are non-functioning, but the computers and controls are salvageable.  The
rest of the wrecks are currently being inventoried and the TL-15 parts will be available
for custom upgrades.  Inquiries to available parts and prices can be directed to the
KeeEEka Strongwall sales office.
<P>
KeeEEka Strongwall can manufacture three Pathfinders with Exploration Pods for a total
cost of 272.89 MCr and 99.651 MCr of relic parts.

These pods can be used with either the <I>Victrix</I> Sloop or the <I>Pathfinder</i> Scout.

<FONT SIZE=5>Exploration Pod         </FONT><P>
This is a fairly general pod, and it is the most commonly encountered.  It can be used
for a wide variety of missions ranging from pure research, to bootstrap missions to cold
recoveries.  It has 4 small staterooms to carry mission specialists. 16 tons of cargo
for their equipment or recovered goods.  For the more scientific missions it has a
laboratory, a neutrino detector and a densitometer.  It also has a minimal hanger for a
standard Coalition Ragtop Airraft. (See RCEG pg 114).  The pod requires 1.812MW of
power, which is supplied from the main ship.  <P>

<FONT SIZE=5> Cattle Car Pod   </FONT><P>

This pod can transport up to 90 individuals if they hotbunk.  It also has room for ten
tons of cargo.  The pod is intended for transporting colonists or workers.  Troops could
be carried, but they would not arrive in peak fighting efficiency due to the cramped
quarters.  Also the pod only has 10 tons of cargo, which probably isn't enough for a
military force.   <P>

<FONT SIZE=5>Liner Pod</FONT><P>

This pod is intended to carry paying passengers or VIP between worlds.  It has 10 small
staterooms and 1 large stateroom.  It also has 16 tons of cargo room.  If High
Passengers are carried, one or more stewards will be required.  They would bunk with the
rest of the crew in the main compartment.<P>

<FONT SIZE=5> Missile Pod</FONT><P>

This pod gives the ship a potent strike capability, though at a premium price.  The
three Master Fire Directors and their associated sensors make up almost all of the pod's
purchase price.  The pod has 5 launcher and reloaders and 25 missile cradles.  This
allows it to carry 30 ready missiles.  The Pod requires a crew of four (1 missile
gunner, and three MFD operators); these additional crew members requires the ship to
have a commander for a total crew of 10.  The pod has a single small stateroom, for a
total of four on the ship.  This forces two of the staterooms to be triple occupied,
while the rest are double occupied.  The pod also has 44 m<sup>3</sup> of cargo space.   The pod
requires 1.20MW of power, which is supplied from the main ship.  <P>

<FONT SIZE=5>Planetary Strike Pod</FONT><P>

This pod gives the ship a planetary strike capaiblity for use in support of Coalition
ground forces.  The ship will usually be used in conjunction with other Coalition
forces, as neither the Victrix nor the Wolverine can carry troops in addition to this
pod.  The Pod carries 10 launchers and mechanical reloaders for the Spruce-class of
strike missiles (RCEG pg 109) and 55 reload cradles, for a total of 65 ready missiles.
The has four workstation for missiliers and 30,000-km laser communicators for target
designation.  The four additional crew members forces the ship to have a commander for a
total crew of 10.  The pod has a single small stateroom, but the ship is still quite
crowded.  This forces two of the staterooms to be triple occupied, while the rest are
double occupied.  The pod also has 13.9 m<sup>3</sup> of cargo. The pod requires 0.1605MW of power,
which is supplied from the main ship.  <P>

<FONT SIZE=5> TL-14 Meson Screen Pod</FONT><P>

This pod is intended for assualts on planets with deep site meson guns.  The pod
provides a 15-MW TL-14 meson screen imported from the Hiver Federation, to protect the
ship as it descends.  The ship can then drop off troops to seize the target.  The pod
has 7 bunks to carry the troops.  Depending on the mission requirments, upto 21 troops
can be carried with hot bunking.  Additional personal can be housed  with the ship's
crew in the staterooms.  This is not the best thing for morale, but this pod is only
used in dire circumstances, and only the best troops are selected for these missions.
They are willing to put up with discomfort if it will help protect the Coalition.  An
alternative use of the pod, is for the pod carrying ship to be accompanied with another
ship which carrries the bulk of the troops.  The troops are transfereed to the pod in
deep space beyond the range of the meson gun, and the pod carrying ship then makes the
assualt.  The pod also has room for 10 tons of cargo, which is intended for the goal of
the smash and grab.  The pod requires 15.6 MW of power from the main ship.  <P>

<FONT SIZE=5>Smash and Grab Pod </FONT><P>

This pod is intended for Smash and Grab missions against hostile forces.  It has six
staterooms for troops and a six ton minimal hanger, normally equiped with two TL-12
Ragtop Air Rafts (RCEG pg 114).  The Air Rafts carry a total of 12 troops which results
in the staterooms beind double occupied.  The pod also has 15.9 tons of cargo room for
equipment for the raid and to bring back the object of the raid.  <P>
