Vulkan Werft is proud to be able to solve the request for a system defense
boat for the Shenk subsector, and to stay far below the price and techlevel
margin with our proposition. The <i>Pasha</i>  SDB is a state of the art TL:14 vessel,
we are producing since 721 with only minor modifications. Our original
constrains when designing the <i>Pasha</i> , have be performance, price and crew
reduction, and flexibility.

Performance: The <i>Pasha</i>  is able to accelerate with 6G for 80G turns, 5 non
focused xray lasers and 2 fast missile auto launcher form the main weaponry.
5 focused xray lasers, 5 sand casters and a small meson screen serve for
defense. The main sensor and communication suite containing Avionics, PEMS-5, 
Radio and Maser has a redundant layout. Two decoy dispenser and EMM makes the
<i>Pasha</i>  difficult to lock, if silent running, while a AEMS-12/Jammer-12
combination provides a good combat resolution when charging opponents.
<p>
Price Reduction: The <i>Pasha</i>  is using a standard 1500MW Wendelstein power plant
from our Tl13 civilian production line. Other non critical parts are from this
line, allowing us to reduce the price by 29.5 MCr from using standard equipment
and 5-10% techlevel based price difference.
<p>
Crew Reduction: All weapons and screens are arranged into batteries and
controlled centralized from the bridge. The price included 7 63MEK49 robots
for engineering and maintenance. A second benefit of using robots is that
they can be used for damage control, even at full evasion.
<p>
Flexibility: As the ship is able to run out of missiles within 3 turns, the
number of main fire controls equals the number of heavy lasers. Two special
point defense lasers are able to engage 10 missiles and fighters, with their
point defense lasers. If the opponent doesn't have missiles and fighters, their
effective range of 6 clicks, would enable them to engage the opponent directly.
The 35dt cargo bay is equipped to hold either up 48 missiles, or a machine and
electronic shop combination. As a specialty the cargo bay is also equipped
with fuel and power connectors to install a jump drive. When using all weapons
at full rate of fire together with all equipment, would result in a power
shortfall of 145MW. When not using the contra graph a normal rate of fire,
provides 220MW power surplus, so either the point defense lasers can be used
at full rate of fire, or both kind of lasers at half rate of fire. If not
using the Jammer, the main weapons can be used at full rof. Even if all
weapons are used at full rof and the jammer is at full power, the shortfall
will still allow the ship to operate at 5.3G. As we know that many other
shipyard are not calculating real Gs based on mass but cheat with thrust
based on displacement, the <i>Pasha</i>  will still be able to outrun many other
ships who classify itself as 6G.
<p>
Conclusion: As Fishers World has TL:14, we think that our vessel will be
superior to TL:15 vessels as the annual overhaul can be done within the
subsector at Wall or Fishers World, while TL:F shipyard capacity is only
available in neighboring subsectors. The possibility of installing a jump 5
drive, would allow to shortcut off time for the annual overhaul significant,
compared to the Jump 1 tender usual for other 400dt SDBs. The overhaul problem
can be even worse, if you would decide for an SDB not having standard size
of 400dt, as the 288th fleet would than also need special tenders, only usable
for this class of vessels. We are sure that our TL:14 solution justifies the
double price of a standard TL:12 SDB.
