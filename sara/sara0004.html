<h3>Designer's Notes</h3>
I never thought that the SDB as presented in the TNE rulebook was
 any good, so I decided to make up my own version. I used SSDS,
 with FFS additions.  It used Heplar to allow TNE fans to use it, 
and it also keeps the cost down.  Thruster plates would have added 
another 100 MCr to the price.  The <i>Griffen</I> uses the 15 ton
 rule of thumb in FFS.  If a ship weighs less than 15 tons per 
displacment ton, it can use the 10tons of thrust per displacment
 ton rule.  I had to sacrifice some armor and weaponry to keep this
 legal. The write up will assume a Reformation Coaltion campaign,
 but if change the names to Sylea or something else, you can use the 
ship in a Milieu 0 campaign.<p>

The price from SSDS is 376.184 MCr, while the FFS price is 417.9822.
 (SSDS gets a 10% price discount.)<P>

The <i>Griffen</I> has significant more firepower than the TNE SDB.  
It is also over three times the price.  The main cost comes from the
 improved sensors. If you assume that SDBs will only be found inside 
of Gas Giants or planetary oceans, linked into a huge sensor net, the 
poor sensors of the TNE SDB can be justified.  I thought the 
<i>Griffen</I> should be capable of performing a wider range of 
missions.  The other increased cost is the extra MFDs to control 
the large number of missiles.  There are some tradeoffs in 
the design.  The <i>Griffen</I> has less armor than the TNE SDB,
 it also has less fuel available for the Heplar.  <P>

<b>Write up</b><br>
The <i>Griffen</I> SDB was developed by Standard Astronics as a replacment for the <i>Dragon</I> class of SDBs.  It was thought that the <i>Dragon</I>s were unable to fully protect the system against maruders.  The <i>Griffen</I> is upgunned, it has additional, more powerful laser turrets and an additional missile barbette.  It also has an improved sensor suite.  The <i>Dragon</I> was designed for coordinated operation with a planetary sensor net.  The <i>Griffen</I> was built for this, but also for independent operation.  It also has room for 10 marines, without forcing the rest of the crew to hot bunk. <P>

The <i>Griffen</I> was built as a interceptor.  If hostile forces appeared in system, but didn't assualt the gas giant, then most of the stationary defenses would be useless.  The <i>Griffen</I> is capable of taking up station in deep space and waiting for an enemy to appear.  It often does this near system jump in spots.  Merchants are told to jump into a certain volume of space. The SDBs can patrol this volume easier than if merchants come in where ever they want.  Of course Pirates know where the Merchants will jump into also, but that is what the SDBs are for.  <P>

The inside of the ship is bright and clean.  There is a fair bit of room for the crew to operate.  There are extra staterooms, either for ship's troops or to give the crew more room.  The Aubani navy places a premium on the morale of its sailors.  To help with this, the ship has an excellent mess.  The ship is too small to carry a full time steward, but the gunners are used as cooking staff.  The other enlisted crew on the ship are required to peform kp duty several times a week.  This is the only way a small ship, can still have freshly cooked meals.  The other option would be to have several tons of frozen diners in the cargo bay.  Faced with this option the crew cheerfully pitches in.  <P>

There are also several state of the art entertainment centers for the crew to relax with.  There is an extensive library of holovids for the crew to watch.  The crew is also offered incentives to take self paced computer taught courses.  These courses can be any subject which intrests the sailor.  Many sailors use these courses to get a start on a college degree, for a life after the service.  To remind the sailors of home, there is a large (9m<SUP>3</SUP>) terrarium in the main crew lounge.  This makes the ship a little less sterile, and also helps out the life support systems by producing some fresh oxygen.<P>
