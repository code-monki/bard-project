The Interstel I-1102 General Purpose Scout ubiquitous throughout the
Solomani Confederation and adjoining areas, serving much the same purpose as
the Imperial Type S Scout/Courier.  The I-1102 is an evolutionary design,
building on the TL-13 I-1101 and the TL-12 I-1100.  The original design has
it's origin in a series of TL-10 and 11 scout ships produced for the United
Nations / Terran Confederation during the Interstellar Wars.  The current
version of the venerable Solomani Scout entered service shortly after the
Solomani Patriotic War (Solomani Rim War), gradually replacing the I-1101 in
active service over the next century.  The craft is also popular with
private organisations, particularly corporations seeking an inexpensive
courier / executive transport.<P>

The I-1102 was produced in huge numbers by the Solomani Confederation, and
saw extensive service during the Retribution War (aka 2nd Rim War, Solomani
Invasion) from 1117.  This ship, and the 'Victrix' class multipurpose sloop
are by far the most common relic ships to be found in the New Era in the
areas once held by the Solomani Confederation, the sheer numbers produced
ensuring the survival of some ships following the Collapse.

<H3>Near Bootes Commonwealth Service</h3>
The Near Bootes Commonwealth operates a number of these craft - theirtech communications and sensor equipment are prized by planetary and
Commonwealth organisations alike.  The Solomani Scout is the vessel most
likely to be encountered beyond the Commonwealth's borders, operated by the
CEF or freelancers in the employ of the Commonwealth.<P>

Stauffenburg und Warne, a small shipbuilder on Aquitaine, plans to restart
production of the I-1102, using TL-12 equipment where needed.  The first
example was laid down on 057-1102, and is expected to be completed by year's
end.<P>

<H3> In Reformation Coalition Service</h3>
Much of the Reformation Coalition was either part of the Solomani
Confederation, or taken from the Imperium by the Confederation during the
Final War.  It is not surprising, therefore, that many examples of the
I-1102 can be found in service within and adjoining Coalition space.  The
Reformation Coalition itself eschews the use of these ships, using more
advanced Imperial Type S Scout/Courier's instead.  Various planetary
governments (particularly the Oriflammen and Balduri) and private
organizations do possess I-1102's.<P>

The I-1102 is also found as Free Trader and Guild starships, and a number of
Vampire I-1102's have been sighted on the Vampire Highway.<P>
 
<h3>Variations</h3>

Variations on the I-1102 design are too numerous to mention fully.  One of
the more unusual modifications is the I-1102/D 'Fin Scout', modified for use
by dolphin crews.  The Belter Scout is another common modification, and is
similar to the 'Seeker' variant of the Type S Imperial Scout.  The I-1102/EX
is a downgraded 'civil' version of the scout, with shorter ranged sensors
and lacking the EM masking equipment of the standard scout (shaving MCr 15
off of the ship's price).<P>

Many examples in service with the Solomani Navy mounted missile launchers in
place of the laser turret.  The lack of available ordinance today has seen
most of these examples retrofitted with laser weaponry.  Another variant in
Naval service was the I-1102/I.  Used for electronic intelligence gathering,
the turret was replaced by a variety of installable listening and
surveillance gear.<P>
