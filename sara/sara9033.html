<P>
The <I>Pathfinder</I> (and her close sister, the
<I>Trailblazer</I>) are Imperial 1103 designs. Originally the
vessels were constructed for use by the IISS on long
range patrol and reconaissance missions along the
perimeter of the Third Imperium. The type had just
reached service when the Fourth Frontier War broke
out, and it did yeoman service for the Scouts in that
war and the subsequent Fifth Frontier War. The
vessel's long range and substantial payload made it
popular for long range scouting and outpost missions
in the rear echelons of the Zhodani advance, and an
effective conveyor for running guns and supplies to
agents and isolated garrisons.
<P>
During the Imperial Civil War its reputation was
further enhanced by its heavy use by all factional
leaders. Dulinor the Black was apparently himelf so
enamored of the class that he renamed his branch of
the IISS after them. The class suffered heavy losses
during the war, but less so than most top-of-the-line
Imperial vessels, and thousands survived until the
release of Virus and the coming of the Collapse.
<P>
The vessel is optimised for a small crew, featuring
automated laser and missle barbettes. It has good
acceleration, jump range and endurance, though Scouts
have complained for years about its inadequate
communication suite. Its docking ring can be optimised
for either one 20 ton or 2 10 ton craft, with either a
Gig, or a Launch and ATV(s) being the normal carried
craft. Because of its long missions, crews are
required to be of high socialbility, though the ship
is not as crowded as some designs, like the <I>Broadsword</I>
Merc Cruiser.

<P>The <I>Pathfinder</I> is yet another example of
the Vilani "Flying Condom", though with a few
aesthetic modifications. Unlike other ships of its
design philosophy, the vessels contours are more
sharply raked and stealth-like than normal, with some
crews likening it to a "flying pair of safety
scissors." Its cargo bay is the customary "drive
through" system, and is linked to the docking ring to
provide easy ground offloading and maintenance of
carried craft and vehicles. The docking ring bulges
slightly above the spine of the vessel, though it is
almost unnoticeable. The docking of craft in the ship
is awkward, as a vessel must be parallel to the main
ship, and is grappled through the top of the hull at a
right angle. Vehicles are provided with a normal
docking ramp at the rear.

<P>With the disestablishment of the RISS's
Exploratory Office, all <I>Pathfinder</I> class ships have
been transferred to the Regency Navy (the <I>Trailblazer</I>,
which is simply a 'finder with a 420,000 km EMS
jammer, are in service with RQS). Because of the
specialised training of scout crews previously, the
members of the new Navy <I>Pathfinder</I> service are
considered to be special operations, though they and
their namesake vessels are deployed with every major
Regency fleet as well as specialised recon and
scouting units.
