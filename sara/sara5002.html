<DD>In order to adequately reinforce the defenses of the Domain, every 
possible starship is benign impressed to service. Squadron after squadron 
of mothballed battleships is benign reactivated, refurbished, and pressed 
into the line to hold back the raiding Vargr.<BR>

<DD>Long ago, a squadron of <B>Voroshilef</B>-class battleships was 
retired from active service, transferred to reserve fleet, and 
ultimately parted in orbit around Mora/Spinward Marches (2924 C367300-8) 
until they could be scrapped. These ships were always second-class 
battleship, never intended for use on the main battlefronts, but in the 
Marches, when used against the Vargr, they promised to be reasonably 
efficient.<BR>

<P>

The <I>Voroshilef</I> is an old Imperial design, removed from active 
service long before <I>Rebellion</I> and <I>Virus Wars</I>. However a 
number of mothballed <I>Voroshilef</I>s were re-activated during the 
rebellion, and some of them may still be operating within Regency, 
Vilds and Vampire Fleets.<P>

Though the <I>Voroshilef</I>-class is outdated, they are still 
considerable opponents for just about any target. <I>Voroshilef</I>s 
massive armor can withstand hits from 500 MJ/cm<SUP>2</SUP> lasers, 40 
GJ/cm<SUP>2</SUP> particle beams, and its meson screen is designed to 
repel 22.5 GJ meson gun hits.<P>

<I>Voroshilef</I> has quite large fuel tanks, allowing it to make 2 
separate 3-parsec jumps and still have enough fuel for 29 G-hours 
thrust, or maximum of 3 separate 3-parsec jumps with 10 G-hours thrust.

<P>

The ship is approximately as large as a city block<SUP>[1]</SUP>, higher 
than 17-story building<SUP>[2]</SUP>, and its fuel tanks contain 
enough liquid to fill over 400 olympic-sized swimming 
pools<SUP>[3]</SUP>.<P>

The ship does not have Grav drives (not a slightest change, for 
they would take too much surface area). However, assuming that HEPlaR 
drives have thrust vectoring, this ship can take off and land on planets 
where local gravity is less than 2G.

<H4>Notes</H4>

Total Fuel Tankage: 2,035,806.3 m3 (145,414.7 tons).<BR>
Fuel scoops (3% of ship surface), fills tanks in 6.06 hours.<BR>
Fuel purification machinery (1.27GW), 48 hours to refine 2,035,806.3 
m3.<BR>
Mass and price includes five 95-ton Shuttles.<BR>
Crew requirements are calculated by using "Modified FFS" crew model.
<P>

This design is based on the data found in <I>Battle Raider</I> and 
<I>Rebellion Sourcebook</I>. However the ship has now only a fixed 6-hex 
PEMS sensor instead of the fixed 8-hex sensor shown in BR datasheet. The 
BR value is obviously an error, since a 200.000-ton hull can have up to 
170 m diameter fixed antenna, and the diameter of a 8-hex antenna is 400 
m.<BR>
<P>



[1] Average city block is 200 x 200 m square.<BR>
