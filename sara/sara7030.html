Merchant Cruisers are a curious residue of
the old Imperial way of doing business. Imperial
corporations were de facto viceroys of the expanding
Third Imperium, and their profitability depended in
large part upon constant expansion into the fringe
regions around the empire's periphery.  Since many of
these regions were already claimed by other powers,
early trade and diplomatic operations had to be
specially protected against military units intent upon
protecting their monopolies, or at least keeping out
the Imperium. The <I>Leviathan</I> class merchant cruiser was
originally commissioned by Barracai Technium in the
late 1090s, intending to use the ship as a vanguard
into untapped or unexplored areas of the Human client
states bordering the Spinward Marches and the Zhodani
Consulate.
<P>
The ships non-standard configuration is referred to as
a "shortened wedding cake on its side" and is often
considered to be one of the ugliest ships short of a
Donosev survey scout. The primary role of this ship is
the safe conveyance of commercial contact teams and
company envoys to previously unopened worlds on the
frontier, and to bring back samples of resources and
manufactured articles for analysis. While cargo
capacity is limited, and armament is barely sufficient
for combat, the <I>Leviathan</I> is still heavier than most
frontier patrol and escort craft. Since the Collapse,
new units of the class have been reserved for the
Regency Navy and Quarantine Service, who usually
assign them force recon and armed survey missions into
the Frontier and near Wilds. Older decommissioned
ships have made their way into the fleets of several
commercial and exploratory users.
<P>
The <I>Leviathan</I> class was built exclusively by Bilstien
Yards of Glisten, and its distribution was confined
entirely to the area Behind the Claw. No magazine is
fitted, and extra missles are stored in cargo
alongside normal stores.
