<HR> 
  For a long time people have 
been saying that the <I>Lancer</I> and <I>Fusilier</I> designs from BR were impossible
to build.  Well, call me the miracle worker :)  The only problem with
these ships as stands is that they are so massive that their fuel is
gobbled up way too quick.  A solution that I checked into that would
work is to strap on 3250 DT worth of Drop Tanks.  Cuts Jump down to 1,
but the G's aren't affected, as the fuel dilates the mass back down to
below the 15.5x limit.  This makes is so there is actually extra power
(enough to have EMM and a FPP in the fuel tanks, and to overpower all
the energy weapons to -2 DM), and increases fuel to nearly 100 G-turns
on the <I>Fusilier</I>, and 75 on the <I>Lancer</I>.  <P>
	Basically, an <I>Aurora</I> class clipper would carry the prefabricated
drop tank, dissasembled, in some cargo bays (could carry enough for two
warships), or a Ship out of the WTH could just carry two of them in its
cargo bay.  Then the ships assemble 1 jump out from their target (or if
the ship is functioning as an SDB, it allready has them attached), the
techs take a week to place the drop tanks on the ships, and then they
jump into the enemy system.  If there is a WTH trader, the drop tanks
can be filled, and added in the enemy system in about an hour or two,
as the ships drift toward the engagement zone.....<P>
	Barring that idea, you just have to really keep an eye on the
fuel gauge.  This is definitely a fleet ship (just like the PoT said
it would be), and will need to be refueled after any battle....<P>

<h3>Notes</H3>
Total Fuel Tankage: 33700.6 m<SUP>3</SUP> (2407.18 tons)<BR>
Fuel scoops (12.5% of ship surface), fills tanks in .77 hours<BR>
Fuel purification machinery (8.4 MW), 144.43 hours to refine 33700.6 m<SUP>3</SUP>.<p>
 
 No damage table yet, without a drop tank that mounts
an FPP, this ship has VERY short legs.  Also, The 8hex PEMS array takes
up all remaining surface area.  Ship usually doesn't run CG at the same
time as everything else.  If there aren't any damage control out and
about, you can make up the power deficit by powering down G-Compensators
in the Fuel tankage<P>
