This ship is one of the most common in the Imperium.  It forms the backbone of most of the megacorp merchent fleets.  It is idealy sutied to hauling vast amounts of material from point a to point b, and that's about all that it can do.  This ship can haul more material in one trip, then most tramp freighters will haul in ten years.  <P>

The ship is a cylinder, with two engine pods mounted at the front of the ship, on small outriggers.  The bridge, living quarters, jump drives are all mounted on the front of the cylinder, almost all of the cylinder is taken up by cargo and fuel.  The ship is fairly spartan, the crew quarters are nice, but nothing spectacular.  The worst that could be said about them is that they are bland.  In fact that goes for the ship in general, it doesn't even have a interesting nick name.  But the ship is doing a bland job, moving large amounts of material between the worlds of the Imperium.  <P>

I tried to follow the original MT version as closely as possible, the only significant thing I changed is that the orignal had a fuel purification plant and fuel scoops.  But the ship is unstreamlined, and can't use its scoops.  I also figure the megacorps will have enough ships that they will have established their own fuel purification plants at the starport, so they can purify fuel for many ships.  Why have each ship carry its own purification plant, when for a whole week it is just sitting there useless.<P>

The ship was designed with <I>Fire Fusion & Steel</I> with the aid of Antti
Lahtinen's spreadsheet.<P>
