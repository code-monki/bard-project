<H3>From Path of Tears pg 38</H3>
"These ships will provide the Coalition with the capability to 
move large numbers of combat troops from one world to another and 
conduct opposed landings.  Each of these ships will carry a light 
brigade, and include launch facilities for a spearhead battalion 
of drop troops.  Although this capability is not intended for use 
in combat, the <I>Leviathan</I>-Class will be streamlined to 
allow landing on planetary surfaces.<P>

Proponents of the coreward stategy see these ships as providing 
new capabilites to pacify worlds far out in the AO, while 
consolidating strategists expect that these ships will be used 
closer to home."<P>

<H3>Designer's Notes</H3>
POT lists a brigade as having three batallions of roughly 500 
soldiers each. I assumed a light brigade was one with only two 
battalions.  The ship is also supposed to be able to drop a 
spearhead battalion into combat. I figured that 400 soldiers and 
100 dummy capsules dropped with most of their command and control 
assests located on the ship sounded like a spearhead battalion.<P>

The design was done with SSDS, with occasional FFS bits.<P>

<H3>Description</H3>
The <I>Leviathan</I>-Class Assualt Transports will be the 
biggest ship in the Coalition Navy upon completion. The same team 
of Naval architects that designed the rest of the Clippers 
designed the <I>Leviathan</I>-Class. It shows this lineage, both 
in its appearence and its internal arrangements. The ship looks 
like a streamlined version of the <I>Aurora</I> and 
<I>Maggart</I>-Classes Clippers, with the addition of small 
stabelizing wings in common with the<I>Lancer</I> and 
<I>Fussilier</I>-Classes. (For a picture of the 
<I>Lancer</I>/<I>Fussilier</I>-Class see their respective Battle 
Rider counters.)<P>

The inside of the ship also resembles the other Clippers.  This 
has its good points and its bad.  The mechanical systems on each 
of the clipper line tend to be versions of each other, and 
reduces the amount of training maintence staffs need.  The 
staterooms are also identical allowing transfered sailors to 
feel instantly at home.  Unfortunatly some of the problems with 
the other clippers have not been fixed, every stateroom still 
has the same badly designed fresher made by Novastar Inc. It has 
a habit of backing up and "regurgitating" its contents back over 
the floor of the fresher.  The Navy has tried to get Novastar to 
fix the design but since Novastar's CEO August Delparo was just 
arrested for treason, the company is in a state of confusion and 
has been unable to come to any agreement over replacing the 
designs.  So when Delparo gets convicted, alot of Coalition 
sailors will cheer his downfall.<P>

<H3>Operations</H3>
During a hostile landing, 400 marines will use the drop capsules 
to make a meteoric descent. They will be accompianed by 100 MK II 
capsules in various loadouts, depending on the mission and the 
commander's preferences. (For details on drop capsules see RCEG.) 
At the same time the ship will be firing planetary assualt 
missiles at enemy targets. As its laser turrets are equiped with 
tunable lasers, they can also be turned on targets on the ground, 
though they are intended at point defense weapons.<P>

Once a beachhead has been achieved, the ship can launch its 
<I>Fury</I>-Class Assualt Landers, which carry a further 196 
marines.  At the same time, any carried grav vehicles can be 
launched. These can include <I>Intrepid</I>-Class Grav Tanks, 
<I>Pyrrhus</I>-Class Support Sleds, and 
<I>Ferret/Mongoose</I>-Class Attack Speeders.<P>

It is not expected that the <I>Leviathan</I>-Class will opperate 
alone. It does not have the firepower to take out opposing 
starships.  It will probably operate in concert with several 
clippers or destroyers.  After these ships have cleared away 
enemy spacecraft they can be used as orbital artillery. 
<I>Fussilier</I>-Class will not tend to be used in this role, as 
their partical accelerators do not work as well in this role as 
the<I>Lancer</I>-Class's meson gun.  <I>Aurora</I>-Class, 
<I>Maggart</I>-Class, and <I>Belladonna</I>-Class Clippers can 
also carry fighters which will provide air support to the troops.<P>
