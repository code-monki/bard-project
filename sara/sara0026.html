    The <i>F'naah</I> class Heavy Fighter is designed for Federation Space
 Superiority and patrol. Carrying 12 standard space missles as well as a
 50-ROF 600Mj Xray Laser Lance.  Defense is provided by a 3 cm thick
 Bonded Superdense hull and a sandcaster.  2 top of the line TL-14 MFDs
 provide fire control w/ one being capable of missle control.<P>
    In situations where the Federation Navy is not facing heavy fighter
 opposition or if that opposition is neutralized, the <i>F'naah</I> is used as a
 point defense screen for Federation capital ships against enemy missles and
 will use its own missles if in range.  Sorties are also directed against
 enemy capital ships, exclusively by missle attack.<P>
    3 Ithklur man the <i>F'naah</I>.  One serves as pilot and controls the
 laser lance through its MFD.  The second lizard is the Sensors Intercept
 Officer (SIO) and controls the electronics and sandcaster.  The third 
 lizard (who by Ithklur tradition is in command) controls the missle MFD
 and missles but whose dynamic control interface can double as SIO. The SIO
 does not have access to the missle MFD, however.<P>
    Quarters are provided and equipped for double occupancy.  When on
 short duration (combat missions), all usually maintain their stations. When
 on long duration deep insystem patrols, the crew usually hotbunks.  1 will
 usually sleep at a time, with two at station. The third can be called when
 the situation warrants.<P>
    12 standard missles are held in unstreamlined grapples on the <i>F'naah</I>.
 To skim fuel, SOP calls for the missles to be released, as it hazardous
 to perform gas giant refueling in an unstreamlined configuration.  The 
 missles are held by MFD for further use in combat.  Should the situation
 warrant the remounting of them, the assitance of an Ithklur crewman going
 EVA is required.  When on board Carrier (particularly the LC-IIIa), the
 fighters are fueled and stored as such, pre-launch.<P>
    <i>F'naah</I> is an Ithklur expression of suprise, denoting joy and wonder
 and the Ithklur trio manning each fighter typically designate their
 individual <i>F'naah</I> with the name of their "mascot flower," which is from a
 "freed" breed.<P>
    As with all Ithklur military equipment, the Ithklur decorate their
 fighter with stories of history, decorative carvings, and numerous
 tetragrams.<P>

Fuel scoops (12% of ship surface), fills tanks in 0.91 hours<BR>
0.1 MW power shortfall<BR>

Power shortfall is usually made up by shutdown of the laser comm (which
is intended as a backup for the maser comm).<P>
