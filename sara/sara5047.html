 This is athe tender used to carry the <a href="sara0040.html"><I>Fury</I>-Class</A> battle riders. The vessel
 carries 18 riders in internal bays. The on board facilities are avilable
 to repair of build new vessels. while R&R for the crews are taken care
 of with libraries, flight sims, survival course, gravball courts, gyms,
 virtual reality stations, weight rooms, running tracks and tridee
 theaters. the tender has a small suit of weapons for self defence and 24
 squadrons of fighters for self defence and offensive actions. A design
 feature is tha baility to double the carrying capacity of the tender
 allowing it to bring 36 BR's into battel though it slows it doen to 3G
 acceleration. the 100 dton scouts are either scouts or J-6 couriers. The
 95 dton shuttles are carried abord in 100 dton hangar's which allow them
 to be replaced with extra scouts if the mission requires it. The tenders
 is able to control and coordinate up to 224 vessels which is the total
 number of vessels that can be shoehorned aboard, while the fighters deck
 controls all the fighters that can be fitted aboard. carrying extra
 small craft requires that the extra crew be double up with the normal
 crewmembers. if extra supplies are required 30,000 dtonpods are carried
 in one of the hangars this  means that the total number of BR's that can
 be carried is reduced. The shipyard can build up to a 60,000 dton vessel
 with J-6 capablities. All the parts can be fabricated aboard and a small
 stockpile of common parts and raw materials is part is located in the
 shipyard.

50-dton missile bay: Four high-speed launch systems for 7 L missiles are
installed in the bay. 
Each includes a launcher, a mechanical reloader with eleven launch
cradles, and a gunner's 
workstation equipped with a 300,000 km laser communicator and a 300,000
km MFD with 
pencil-beam AEMS. The bay also includes a magazine for storing eight
more missiles.
The bay contains 56 missiles, of which 48 are loaded to fire; the bay
may fire 40 missiles in any 
turn and can control up to 24 of them. If the bay fires no faster than
16 missiles a turn, it may fire continuously until the ship's magazine
is exhausted; at 24 per turn it can fire for two turns, then needs to
spend one to reload. There are a further 4500 in a ready magazine
located near the bay.<P>

Hull material bonded superdense
There are extra staterooms used to house crew from up to six of the
riders while their ships are 
either undergoing repairs or as a break from duty. <P>
The Flag Bridge is capable of handling up to 224 vessels while the
fighter control deck can 
handle up to 720 fighters at once. 
The flag quarters are a suite of richly appointed rooms for the use for
the admiral in command of 
the squadron. <P>
