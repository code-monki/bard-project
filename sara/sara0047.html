The <I>Salamander</I> Gunboat was designed to answer the Regency's need for system defense craft capable of dealing with attacking Vampire ships.  The boat is highly specialized for this mission and has little utility other than combat.   The boat was designed to maximize offensive punch. The boat is designed to take up station and defend it from all comers.
<P>
The boat is armed with two custom built laser bays.  Each laser bay has six 750 Mj non-grav focused laser cannons. This adds up to 9 gigajoules of laser energy being pumped out.  This is a fearsome ammount for such a small craft.  The cannon's range is fairly short due to the lack of gravitic focusing.  This is acceptable becuase the vessel was designed for combat against attacking forces who must advance into the <I>Salamander's</I> range.  Each bay is controlled by a MFD on the bridge.  In the event that one of the MFDs is knocked out, the other MFD can link both bays and fire them on the same target.
<P>
The <I>Salamander</I> does not ignore defense.  The boat is armored with 19.6 cm of bonded superdense for a total armor value of 550.  This is enough to shrug off the standard Tl-15 150 MJ laser turret and to reduce the standard TL-14 300 MJ laser barbette to a minor hit.  In addition the boat mounts three state of the art sandcasters and three point defense lasers.  These lasers can shoot down incoming missiles or engage attacking small craft.  To make it more difficult for enemy craft to lock on, the <I>Salamander</I> has electromagnetic masking, decoys and a long range EMS jammer.
<P>
Due to the massive amounts of armor, the craft is extremly heavy and requires oversized engines and a corresponding large amount of fuel.
<P>
The <I>Salamander</I> is a spherical craft.  The bridge is located at the center of the sphere.  It is surrounded by crew quarters.  The engine room is at the back of the sphere.  Fuel tanks are mounted on the inside of the hull and provide  additional buffer between the enemy and the crew.  It is a fairly utilitarian vessel, and the insides are rather uninspired.  The staterooms are a bit cramped and fairly ugly with exposed pipes and cables running through most spaces.
