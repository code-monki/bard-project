(Note: I do not have a complete set of modules for
this design yet. But they should be up tomorrow,
albeit without being included in the Call To Arms
contest. But these include a 100 ton fighter carrier
with 4 Ramparts in minimal hangars, a trio each of
cargo and armed fuel modules, a 100 ton assault module
with provision for 20-40 troops and a 50 ton cutter,
and a 100 ton armed patrol module with four additional
barbettes and docking rings for 2 20 ton armed gigs.)
<P>
Overview: In the aftermath of the Rape of Trin, the
Regency was forced to put as many ships into frontline
Naval or Quarantine service as it could spare. It
became clear, however, that the emphasis upon frontier
defense would denude other service branches of badly
needed ships at a time when shipyards will still in
the process of getting up to wartime mobilisation. The
solution hit upon by several companies and contractors
were cheap conversions of existing hulls, most notably
TL 13-14 hulls rendered superfluous by the demanding
requirements of the Virus War.
<P>
Adamantium LRC happened to possess several hundred
surplus <I>Gazelles</I> as part of an earlier remanufacturing
program that converted these ships into newer
Praetorian sloops. But in the wake of the RoT, the
meson guns required for the conversion became scarce
because of changing priorities. So the company turned
lemons into lemonade, taking the stripped hulls, and
installing a plug that expanded to 55 meters length,
and converting them into modular designs.
<P>
The  <I>Morpheus</I> is intended for a variety of yeomen
roles, utilising modular construction as a logistic
and support "force multiplier." Easy conversion into
different roles will enable one Morpheus to free up
two or three other ships for patrol duty. While
technically a rear echelon vessel, several of its
modules are equipped to turn it into a heavy patrol
design on short notice, enabling rapid reinforcement
of threatened regions without the limitations of
lengthy communication lags. Another plus of this
design is its obvious use as a Q-ship or a merchant
cruiser in frontier areas, as the indistinguishable
nature of its modules make identification difficult,
so that even the lightly armed cargo loadout can be
percieved as a threat, and act as a deterrent to
raids.
<P>
The class utilizes mixed construction: TL-15
powerplants, jump drives and electronics mated to
TL-14 weapons. Most of the original ships were still
fitted with their original armaments. These weapons
are usually fired remotely, though local control is
provided in case of protracted military operations.
The ships modular layout is unusual: while intended
for a variety of 25, 50 and 100 ton modules, space
limitations dictate that module A is always a 50 ton
module, leaving the remaining 100 tons according to
the discretion of the owner/operator when not in line
service. Module A is usually a General Operations
module that combines cargo and passenger operations,
and when not in RQS service the other modules are
usually for cargo or fuel as well. In service these
modules are either mated with other armed units, or
replaced alltogether.
