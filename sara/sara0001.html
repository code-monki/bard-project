The <I>Hobnail</I>-Class SDB was orignally proposed as an
alternative to the
<!A HREF="sara####.htm"><I>Leviathan</I>-Class Assualt Ship</A>.
The orignal plan was to equip a
<!A HREF="sara####.htm"><I>Maggart</I></A> with 3
<I>Hobnails</I>.  The
<!A HREF="sara####.htm"><I>Maggart</I></A> would orbit the
planet providing fire support, while the 3 <I>Hobnails</I>
would descend to the surface, land the troops, then take the
air to provide fire support.  This has several advantages over
the
<!A HREF="sara####.htm"><I>Leviathan</I>-Class</A>. First, the
<!A HREF="sara####.htm"><I>Maggart</I></A> is available for
other missions when an assualt ship is not needed.  Also the
<I>Hobnails</I> would split the troops into three sections,
during atmospheric descent, which is when the ships are at
their most vulnerable position. Prejduce against low tech
ships helped kill the <I>Hobnail</I>-Class Assualt Ship design.
Some
<!A HREF="../opal/opal####.htm">Oriflammi</A> blame the
<!A HREF="../opal/opal####.htm">Aubaini</A> for shooting down
the proposal purely because it came for
<!A HREF="../opal/opal####.htm">Oriflamme</A>.<P>

After sinking millions of credits into the design, and
constructing several examples of the class, the
<!A HREF="../icis/icis####.htm">Bourgand</A>
Technarchs were faced with a ship without a mission.  They
finally decided to market it as an export SDBs.  It is fairly
inexpensive, and provides a great deal of flexibility. It has a
100 ton pod bay.  Pods can be used to carry extra space missles,
planetary strike missles, extra troops, small craft such as
fighters or assualt landers or extra space based weapons systems.
It has 85 tons of cargo room, allowing the ship to carry supplies
for a large number of troops or armored vehicles for the troops.
The hold can even be turned into bunk room for extra troops.  The
ship also comes with missle bays for either planetary strike
missles, cruise missles, or air to air missles. It also possesses
a large bomb bay, allowing the ship to bomb planetary targets.
The ship is very heavily armored allowing it to shrug off most
lasers and PAWs.  It is even sufficent to shrug off the blasts
from an
<!A HREF="../vera/vera####.htm"><I>Intrepid</I>-Class tank</A>.<P>

The <I>Hobnail</I>-Class will never be a capable of fighting off
a TL-15 warship on a one to one basis, but in groups it would be
able to protect a planet from a small vampire ship.  It is quite
capable of serving as a customs vessel, and protecting merchants
from the standard Corsair.  <P>

The
<!A HREF="../opal/opal####.htm">Oriflamme</A> salespeople do a
wonderful job of selling the ship to Wilds clientele. They
promote the versatilty of the ship, while glossing over the
poor sensor suite, and limited manuverability. Most of the
Wilds leaders they are selling to, have not had any formal
training in modern naval warfare, and are easily dazzled with
flash and gloss.<P>

Most clients in the Wilds, do not possess starports capable of
maintaining and servicing the ships, so
<!A HREF="../opal/opal####.htm">Oriflamme</A> is happy to
sell service contracts.  They will also provide crews for the
ships, or train native crews for the ships.  Occasionally the
salespeople will cut a deal, if they are guarenteed long term
contracts, or if the buyer buys in bulk.<P>
