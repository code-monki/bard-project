Ara Pacis was originally settled by a group of mining
companies to take advantage of the local titanium
deposits. As trade grew between Deneb and the
expanding Spinward Marches, this overtook the income
from the mines, and the world is now primarily a
banking and service center for commerce moving down
the Midway into Rhylanor. Corporate infighting can be
rather vicious, as the companies here are soverign
states, and can wage war and diplomacy as they see
fit. Sternmetal, General Products and SuSAG all have
major enclaves here, and "cold wars" limiting contact
between them were common during the Antebellum period.
Regency law prohibits the more violent kinds of
corporate aggression, and Ara Pacis has become more
peaceful. Intrigue and espionage waged by each
corporate faction are still quite common, and the
locals are witness to many defections and occasional
assassinations.
