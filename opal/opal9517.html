  <P>
A pleasant desert world located in the middle of the
subsector.  It had the unlikely role, in the last
years before the Civil War of being the downfall for
the Imperial Ministry of Colonisation.
 <P>
At the same time that the MoCol was initiating the
Jonkereen project, it was researching desert world
terraforming methods in a parallel project. Penelope
became one of several worlds, scattered around the
Imperium, that were settled as "testbeds" for these
menthods.  Previously unsettled, a colony of
researchers and pioneers was established after the
Third Frontier War to test the MoCol's terraformation
protocols.
 <P>
As MoCol began to develop excessive zeal and hubris in
the 1000s, the project began to take on grandiose
dimensions.  The research had produced limited but
promising results, and project managers began to
expand their efforts from simple research projects
into application of it towards real terraformation.  A
number of testbed worlds were converted into full
terraformation projects, and of these Penelope was the
most hyped and fully funded.
 <P>
MoCol is estimated to have poured trillions of credits
of the taxpayers money into these megaengineering
projects, despite objections from their own scientific
staffs, the IISS and the Ministry of Science over
their scale, cost, dubious methods and feasibility.
Many projects bogged down in bureaucratic stonewalling
and interagency disputes.
 <P>
But Penelope had the benefit of its remote location
and the support of the local nobility to keep it
going.  Under MoCol supervision from its offices on
Iderati, the world was bombarded with redirected
cometary debris. Vaporaters extracted subterranean
water and expelled it into the atmosphere. Massive
"groomers" altered the world's albedo to reflect more
sunlight. A sulfide haze was created to further cool
the world surface.  Plant life was introduced around
reservoirs to provide shading. And an extensive
underground network of cisterns and canals were
constructed, criss-crossing the world.  There was even
talk of using Meson Guns to heat the world's interior
to induce volcanism, thereby bringing more moisture to
the surface.
 <P>
In the end, after nearly a century of work, the
Penelope had yet to create a single natural body of
water, and the planet was scarred by worthless
construction projects and their debris. Disgusted with
MoCol, the First Regent terminated the program in
1134. And citing Penelope as clear evidence of the
Ministry's ineptitude and superfluousness, Norris
sacked it, merging its personnel with the Ministry of
Conservation in 1136 to form the Ministry of Interior.
 <P>
With the termination of the project, Penelope's
population was suddenly unemployed, but were buoyed up
by development money released from the appropriation
funds for the project.  Ironically enough, the world's
emergence into an integrated member of the Regency was
overseen by chastened former project managers now
working for MoI.  The local economy is now
self-reliant thanks to dry agriculture methods and
mining of its underdevloped mineral resources. To aid
in the world's development, Jonkereen were permitted
to settle the world in the 1140s and now make up 12
percent of the population.
