As described in the previous entry on <A href=opal9513.html">Wonstar</A> - Five
Sisters, Karin was settled by one of two branches of a
liberal "back to basics" group wanting to escape the
noise and corruption of the Imperial Core.
Unfortunately, the liberal weapons code, combined with
a contempt for the customary methods of law and order,
nearly did the colonists in.
 <P>
Conflicts over land and water turned into escalating
fights between large landholders and their militias.
Eventually the these petty wars, displaced most of the
population, destroyed every part of local economy not
affiliated with supplying the war, and brought the
world to the brink of famine and anarchy.
 <P>
In 970 the commander of the local Imperial Navy base,
fearful that the Imperium might lose the world, called
in the Imperial Marines to pacify the population and
quell the violence. The Karin Pacification (970-977)
was a brutal operation, even by the relaxed standards
of the Marines. Planetary militias were hunted down
with extreme prejudice, and factional leaders were
either exiled or executed.  Most of the population was
resettled in a series of camps near the base and
starport, carefully watched by the Navy. Guerilla
activity continued for several years, only to be
rooted out and annihilated.
 <P>
The Navy had to destroy the world in order to save it.
It's intervention was predicated only to preserve
Imperial order, not in any genuine concern for the
welfare of the populace.  The Marines probably killed
as much of the population in a few short years as all
of the petty wars in the centuries before combined.
And the post-pacification administration imposed by
the Navy was equally high-handed and paternalistic,
especially in its arbitrary reconstruction of the
world's infrastructure and public institutions.  Most
weapons were banned, and the Naval authorities imposed
draconian penalties on smuggling, incitement of
violence and "suspicious" public assembly. To prevent
future hostilities, all of the privately held land
that had been in dispute before was placed in a public
trust to be administered and policed by the Navy.
 <P>
So instead of gratitude, the Navy reaped hostility and
resentment as the result of its policies. The local
base became a fortified occupation encampment, and the
usual fraternization of base personnel with the locals
was supplanted by heavily armed patrols.  Surliness
towards the troops, silent protests, and occasional
vandalism and bombings by the locals garnered the
world a permanent Amber Zone posting.
 <P>
Around 1030, a unified home rule movement began
agitating for independence, but to no avail. By that
time the world's reconstruction had been completed,
and the locals seemed to finally learn to get along
with each other.  But the Navy was fearful of a return
to the traditional violence if the troops were pulled
out, and at any rate had grown accustomed to governing
their unwilling yet penitent protectorate.
 <P>
This attitude still permeated among the local Navy
brass right up to the Representational Reforms.  The
commander of the 208th Fleet actually attempted to
garner a waiver for the naval occupation force, but
was rebuffed by the united front of Regent Norris and
the Chief of Naval Operations.  When the referendum
went to the locals, the Navy then attempted to sway
the vote through scare tactics, reminding them of
their bloody past.  The clumsiness of their campaign
merely reinforced the local voters prejudice: the Navy
lost by a margin of 81 to 19.
 <P>
Contrary to the Navy's dire predictions, Karin has
become a mature and peaceful world.  The locals
suprised the Navy by shrewdly retaining most of the
ancillary naval civilian bureaucracy that previously
administered the world, but now as an independent
organisation subordinate to the local laws and
planetary constitution. The navies restrictions on
armaments were retained and reinforced.  The old
surveillance network was reinforced by a large psionic
police unit. Even the day-to-day patterns imposed by
years of naval occupation, especially the exacting
discipline and organisation demanded of civilian life,
remained intact.
 <P>
Land other than a small allotment given to individual
families is still held in common trust.  Private
development of that land is allowed when it is
justified for the common good.  Land and conservation
laws are enforced by heavily armed rangers, and all
approaches to, and frontiers on, the world are heavily
monitored and patrolled by a mixture of Regency and
Karin World forces.  Travellers arriving on world are
searched for contraband, and in a departure from the
norm, are scanned by psionic police and security
without their knowledge.  Suspicious individuals are
frequently tailed by undercover officers; yet in spite
of all of this heavy surveillance, there is little
evidence of paranoia, and these are seen by the locals
as acceptable public safety norms.
 <P>
The locals had, despite all of their surliness, come
to appreciate the Navy's arguements and concerns; they
had simply resented its intrusiveness and
authoritarian control over their lives, and had merely
wanted the chance to govern themselves once again. And
perhaps this explains the very warm relations between
the local government and the naval garrison.
