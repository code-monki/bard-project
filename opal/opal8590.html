Montane suffered catastrophic volcanism in its distant
past, and is covered under meters of volcanic lava and
ash, giving it a tortured and wracked appearance
visible even from space. Its oceans have been silted
over by repeated ashflows, and the local ecosystem and
climate have never recovered. Most of the world's most
valuable resources are also buried under this debris,
and what is left has never attracted anything more
than a few wandering vagabonds and transients. The
local starport is the main source of local income, and
the listed population is mostly ancillary to the port
and its environs.
