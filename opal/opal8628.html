Rimkuku's atmosphere is highly charged by solar flare
activity. While surface radiation levels remain
tolerable, the increased heat and friction turn the
world into a permanent lightning storm. Winds of up to
hurricane intensity tear through the upper atmosphere,
and are severe enough near the equator to prevent ship
landings. Lightning arcs measuring up to 100 miles
(160 km) in length have been recorded by orbiting
satellites, and when discharges ignite airborne sulfur
compounds it creates an incandescence that is visible
to the 100 diameter line. The surface of the world is
quite calm by comparison, but the local atmosphere
remains unbreatheable without PLSS. The world contains
many resources useful to industry, and the surface is
dotted with domed communities that mine, process or
utilise these resources for manufacturing or export.
All of these communities are independent from each
other, and wars have erupted in the past over
resources and territory.
