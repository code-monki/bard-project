This remote world was always the subject of major
Imperial interest since its contact in 776. The former
Ancient sites are well preserved despite Final War
damage, and the local Droyne community is one of the
most advanced and well organised known in antebellum
times.  Extensive terraforming was carried out by the
Ancients, lowering the worlds surface temperature to
bearable levels, and the current community continues
this work, albeit in a less advanced manner.  The
local factories and yards are the heart of the
Regency's defenses in the region, and about half of
the ships that are manned by the 231st originated on
Auitawry. Despite the threat of Virus infection,
automation and robots are used heavily in factories
and mines, and most of these are equipped to permit
the Droyne supervisors psionically appraised of their
status. The local red zone is no longer backed by an
interdiction, and now merely reflects the worlds
dangerous position near the Wilds, and previous
attacks by Vampire fleets coming through the Rift via
calibration points. The old antebellum interdiction
was similar to that used for the worlds of Candory and
Andor in the Marches, and extensive commercial contact
was permitted within the confines of the downport.
<P>
The main naval base is located entirely in orbit, and
has the facilities and logistical base to function as
an old Imperial naval depot. The base is known as
Crosshairs in memory of the Solomani intel operation
that the 231st is based upon, and functions both as a
defense facility, and as a base for operatives working
in the Imperial and Aslan Wilds. One of Auitawry's
moons, nicknamed Mellow by the Naval and RQS crews,
has been given over to the Regency forces as a rest
and recreation facility. The high stress and long duty
tours of the Rift can build up, and Mellow's bars and
resorts are infamous dives, as crews blow out their
tensions in dramatic fashion. Naturally most Droyne
are barred by their government from visiting Mellow.
