Haggard is a de facto part of the Regency by virtue of
the high security scout base located near the
downport. Like Errogel's naval base, this facility is
primarily for intelligence gathering and salvage. Most
of the population are base dependents and a few brave
souls that refused evacuation when the world was first
abandoned. The base is located entirely underground,
and is a level 4 containment facility that was
originally constructed for the Scout Exploratory
Office. Free traders peddling scrap and useful salvage
are a common sight on this world, particularly members
of The Souk Free Trader Collective.
