Hadara was once known as the Basket Case of the Reach.
The Rule of Man colonists that settled on the world
were from a sublight ship that accompanied several
across the Rift, a fleet that included the colonists
that settled Crescent.  Their landing on Hadara was a
shambles due to poor leadership and disorganisation,
and they barely salvage enough material to eke out a
living on their hostile world.
<P>
Technological regression slowly sapped the worlds
strength, as the colonists lost the ability to
construct basic industrial machinery, and could only
jury rig repairs to their domes after some time.
Survival was further complicated by the colonists
burgeoning population, which strained the failing life
support plants and available living space to the
limit. Offworld assistance was offered by a number of
interested parties, but was spurned by the xenophobic
locals until the early 1000s.
<P>
Their choice of saviors was less than beneficial. They
chose a consortium of private companies to take care
of world recovery, but it turned out to be a dummy
front for a group of oppurtunistic mercenaries based
within the Florian League.  The mercs converted the
world into a base for their operations, and used their
superior firepower and control of offworld shipments
to coerce the Hadarans into submission.  The
inhabitants extracted ore and worked in labor houses
under close guard, and were never allowed offworld or
to come in unsupervised contact with offworlders.
<P>
While these abuses were common knowledge among
Imperial and Florian officials, both governments
followed a non-interference policy in regards to
non-aligned worlds in the Reach. What was unknown to
both governments was that these mercs were actually a
front organisation as well, and was actually a Zhodani
military unit supporting the Consulates own operations
against Imperial and Florian interests, and their base
on nearby Pa'an.
<P>
It wasn't until a chance discovery by a Florian naval
patrol of Zhodani military traffic moving through the
system just before the Fifth Frontier War that action
was taken against the planetary government. The
Florian military, supported by some Imperial units,
seized the world in 1108 and terminated most of the
Zhodani and their agents in a bloody purge. Hadara was
placed under League protection, and a Florian garrison
was stationed to protect against future Zhodani
aggression.
<P>
In the wake of detente between with the Zhodani, the
Florians downgraded the garrison, and slowly rebuilt
the worlds infrastructure and institutions as
preperation for independence.  Schools and hospitals
were constructed, and the older colony domes were
demolished in favor of new structures that the
Hadarans could maintain on their own. By the time of
independence in 1180, Hadara was fully capable of
managing itself for the first time in centuries.
<P>
Currently Hadara is trying to attract more trade
through its port, though mostly this has been traffic
moving between the Florians and the Aslan, which
doesn't amount to very much given lingering
hostilities.  The world is ruled by the last colonial
governor, and this is considered to be a transitional
government until the locals get better accustomed to
self-rule. Relations with the Florians are very warm,
and League naval vessels were welcomed with
enthusiastic crowds before it became clear that this
was alienating the growing tide of Aslan merchants.
The world is now a clearinghouse for trade between the
two antagonists, with the Hadarans acting as brokers
for the movement and sale of commodities between their
borders.
