 Keipes (0132 B677884-6) declares the fourth Empire after the sudden
 death of Tekim Hsun, Grand Master of the Order of Revealed Knowledge.
 <P>    The Grand Master and 31 members of the Order were killed by an
 accident while demonstrating a relict TL13 grav tank.  We have
 information about excavations at the destroyed Imperial navy base.
 Whether the tank is realy a relic or an outworld import is not know
 yet.  It appears that the "accient" was a carfully planed murder
 attempt.  Elite troops of Grand Duke Eledo of Balawak blocked the
 whole region.<P>
     On the next day, Kim Eoi was declared as new Grand Master.  She's
 known as a progressive force in the Order of Revealed Knowledge.  A
 wave of arestments were noticed by our agents in Peidoan, capital of
 Keipes, and in other cities.  Duke Eledo declares martial law for the
 next two months.<P>
     The days later, Grand Master Kim Eoi declares the the Moot will be
 reastablished with all Nobility (we know about 22) of Keipes having a
 vote and the Order having veto right. The Moot should elect a new
 regent within two weeks. Duke Eledo declares this day as an holyday.
 <P>
     The local news system announces the beginning of a new era. The
 Order of Revealed Knowledge has done a good job, perserving know
 needed wisdom and develloping "methods" to banish the all destroying
 virus. But know, each citizen has the duty to help the reastablishing
 the new and better empire.<P>
     Our agents had found indications of offworlder activities.  One
 picture shows three human-looking persons wearing the old imperial
 combat armors.  A detailed plan exists to restructure the Keipes
 economy and to raise the TL within one year.

 Keipes (the fourth Imperium) announces the release of the captured RC
 personal as a good-will action and beginning of success diplomatic
 contact.
    <P> We received an official message of Grand Duke Eledo of Keipes, in
 which he announces the release of all captured RC personal.  They
 could decide whether to stay on Keipes as guests or tranported back to
 the RC.  All accusations against them were abolished because of a
 general amnesty.

<B>Comments:</B><BR>
	Fav Prime was a large independent mining factory with a space
	port where 4180 people were working.  After a virus destroyed
	the energy plants, all workers died.
<P>
	The moon Nio held a small military base with 292 soldiers.
	This base was totally destroyed through a vampire ship attack
	in 1145.
<P>
	The moon Hsui of Peyateo of has a protected high tech research
	base.  Perhaps, this base wasn't discovered by the virus and
	Dr. Penui Deo and her assistants might have survided in low
	berth.
<P>
