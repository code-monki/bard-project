In the rebellion the only people with reason to visit this world were, by and 
large, the Navy and Scouts. The Naval Base was large, and provided support and 
co-ordination for the Colonial Squadrons in their quadrant of the Expanses. The Scout
Base's role was ecological survey of the area, and this was wound down as the Rebellion
dragged on. Margaret's faction maintained the Navy Base there through the Hard Times, but
it was a shadow of it's former strength when the Virus destroyed it in the collapse. The
Technocrats who ruled the world for the navy were replaced by the remnants of the navy
left on the planet, who managed to organise the people into a cohesive government that
encompassed the whole world. Apart from the construction of a 'D' class port by the <A HREF="../peri/peri0007.html">VTA</A> 
there has been little trade save that in relics recovered from the ruins of the Naval 
Base. Still, Scout teams have raised the tech level from 4 to 5 in the last 7 years, and
hope to integrate some of Voskl's TL-9 equipment into the infrastructure when it becomes 
surplus.<p>
