Rayel is famous for its five moons, more than any
other terrestial body in Charted Space. The world
itself is covered with sandy deserts, in which the
Rayelian moons create complex tidal patterns. The
original reason for the world's settlement is now
obscured by history, as it possesses few resources of
redeeming value, and its noxious atmosphere would seem
to turn away immigrants. The world is famous for its
hospitality, and the cohesiveness of its communities.
The local population is agoraphilic, and long periods
of an inhabitants day seems to be filled with
conversation and discourse with neighbors and friends.
Family bonds are extremely strong, and most
neighborhoods and small communities are actually
extended families by marriage or adoption. Offworlders
who ingratiate and prove themselves will often find
themselves adopted by a local clan or collective and
made a full member of local society. Rayelian
government is headed by a council of senior clan and
collective leaders, usually the most elder and
experienced members of a community and its affiliated
parts.
