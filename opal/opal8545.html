This previously unclaimed worldwas bought out by
SpinDev/Ventureprise in 1155. The ecosphere is
primitive, and is dominated by large rainforests of
spore producing trees and terrestrial invertebrates.
Several of these spores are toxic to humans, and
accounts for the Amber Zone listing. Spindev's
operations on the world are shrouded in semi-secrecy,
and have aroused the irritation of RQS several times.
The company had been notoriously difficult in
explaining irregular shipping patterns during the
1160s and 70s, and nearly lost its charter. The
implied smuggling has ended, but the company's
operations are still dogged by rumor and controversy.
