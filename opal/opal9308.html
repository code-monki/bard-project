Capshobem is a stormy world.  Complex interactions
with its F8V primary and a severe axial tilt of 54
degrees create weather patterns that were severe
enough to deter major colonisation attempts. Massive
polar freezing occurs on the side of the world
experiencing winter, while the other pole undergoes
massive evaporation of its ice cap during the summer.
The collision between warm, moist air and fast, cold
air makes the equatorial and "warmside" temperate
zones regions of unstable tornadic weather.  The
unpredictable devastation of this weather was deemed
to great a risk to place a colony, and the sole
inhabitants were employees and dependents of the local
orbital starport.
 <P>
The Avalar Consulate seized the world in 1132 as part
of its "clean-slate" approach to settling border
disputes in the wake of the Collapse.  Which was
funny, since Avalar had no disputes to settle other
than friction with the client-state of Urnian.  Avalar
was simply satisfying some repressed imperial urge
rather than addressing genuine security concerns.  The
Consulate's seizure of Capshobem was bloodless, and it
wasted no time in annexing the world, and attempting
to settle it.
 <P>
To settle the world, the Consulate found it had a
small problem.  Aside from Dotemire (Beyond 1505) and
Nordstrom (Foreven 1523) it had no water worlds, and
almost no experience in settling one, which were
severe liabilities with on so dangerous world.  So
instead of a single unified group of colonists, the
Consulate had to organise the settlers piecemeal from
whatever it could acquire or recruit.  With strong
leadership, the colony would still have easily
survived and even prospered with the amount and type
of material that was being provided to them. But the
Consulate, in a reflection of its own divided
bureaucratic culture, did little to encourage unity
among the colonists, and preferred to play them off
against each other.
 <P>
The colonists settled in specially reinforced
underwater arcologies that kept them from being
exposed to the world's massive storm systems.  But
within the close proximity of the domes, tensions
quickly became animosities, fanned by offworld
bureaucratic infighting.  Disruptions in supplies,
bickering between colonial leaders, and a disaster in
a deep sea mine in 1138 that left the colony without
power and sanitation for weeks led several groups to
secede from colonial government.  These groups
attempted to seal off sections of the arcologies for
themselves, set up seperate life support systems, and
develop alternative economic supports.  Though
violence was narrowly averted, most of these
"autarkists" were eventually either expelled or
voluntarily emigrated to the surface.
 <P>
Today the world is still divided between the
autarkists and the "domies". Most of the autarkists
either settled in new underwater cities of their own
devising, or in nomadic "white" fleets that follow the
weather patterns closely, never wandering outside of
the relatively peaceful high pressure regions at the
wintering poles. The tech levels of these groups vary
widely, from about 4 to a high of 7.  Embittered by
the past deadlock with the domies, the autarkists are
fiercely self-reliant, and take pride in their
fortitude and ability to adapt to their world's
treacherous nature.
 <P>
Oddly enough the Domies vary little from the
autarkists in their adaptations to the world, and
their strict ecological outlook. While possessing the
listed TL of 9, and having grown considerably into
several communities, they too consider themselves
tested by the adversity of the past, tempered with
pride at their tenacity in not abandoning their cities
for the surface. However, the bitterness of the past
has left these groups unreconciled to each other, and
tensions sometimes lead to brief but bitter battles
over resources and territory.  The Amber Zone is a
reflection of these tensions.
 <P>
Visitors to the world usually find little to interest
them, and rarely alight from the highport.  This is a
pity, for while the locals have a hard time with each
other, their hospitality towards offworlders is
legendary.  Visitors are often plied with food, wine
and companionship, and the isolation of many
communities make them rather amenable to conjugal
relations between unmarried family members and
offworld traders.  As on ancient Iceland, marital ties
are rather loose and collegial, and it is possible for
offworlders to have children that they may never know
about or meet.
