Maelstrom is aptly named. The world has a fourteen
hour rotation period, and vicious two hundred
kilometer per hour winds whip the surface. Fortunately
the world is covered entirely in water, and the
population lives entirely in underwater habitats with
few or no surface protrusions. The local ocean floor
is littered with mineral deposits, particularly iron,
nickel, copper and cobalt.  The locals harvest these
metals in <A href="../vera/vera2004.html"><i>Tiamat</I></A>
and <a href="../vera/vera2004.html"><i>Gashedda</A></I> mining crawlers, which
then offload their cargos into large submersibles that
carry the ore back to the downport for processing and
offworld shipment. The population of each habitat
largely keeps to itself, as local conditions do not
allow for much interaction.
<p>
Each colony is connected to the downport by a series
of underwater "trains", wheeled trams that carry
passengers and cargo in safety. The local downport is
a vertical underwater platform that descends 700
meters to a radiating hub of tramways at its base.
Incoming ships must make a water landing, on a small
elevator platform that cancels their buoyancy and
lowers them into the port.
