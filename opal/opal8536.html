Formerly known as Ostov. Its close proximity to the
Vargr Extents never permitted the intensive
colonisation that it deserved. A colony was
established in 887, but it had only grown to a
population of a few hundred thousand by the eve of the
Imperial Civil War. Vargr raiding forced the
evacuation of most of the population, and in the wake
of the Collapse Vargr refugees from the United
Followers of Augurgh flooded into the largely
abandoned settlements. The Vargr population has been
severely victimised by both corsairs and Vampire
Fleets, and are strongly supportive of the Regency.
With the reopening of the Regency Frontier,
represenatives from the world have appeared on Uramid
and Antra to recruit interested human and Vargr
colonists.
