 KruyterCorp purchased two <a href="../sara/sara0004.html"><I>Griffen</I></A> System Defense Boats from Standard Astronics on Aubaine in 1200, they were delivered in II 1201.  The crews are composed of mostly novices straight from technical schools on various RC worlds.  The officers were hired away from the RCN, but they are not the best and the brightest, but the greediest.  As such the ships are poorly run and the crews are poorly trained.  The expectation is that they will perform custom duties, rather than defending the system against invaders.  As such their performance is adequate.
 <P>
 The two ships have been christened the <I>Mother Lode</I> and the <I>Beltstrike</I>.

 In addition to the two SDBs, KruyterCorp posesses a small security force of a 100 officers. They patrol the ports and also are assigned to the SDBs to investigate incoming ships.
