Zeng is the only free standing world in its sparse
system. It was first settled in 214, and became the
capitol of District 247 in 278. As more profitable
areas of Deneb were opened up to development, Zeng's
heavy industry moved elsewhere, and the world is
primarily an administrative center, albeit
increasingly a symbolic one as the subsector has been
torn apart in recent years by civil war. The only
community on the world is named Zeng as well, and it
mostly consists of government offices, the Subsector
Senate and Moot, and the downport/dirtside naval
bases. About half of the population is directly
employed as government bureaucrats, the remainder are
mostly support and service personnel that keep things
running. There is usually not enough of the latter
group, and a large transient population of offworld
guest workers live in hostels and public housing
during the main partt of the governmental calendar.
