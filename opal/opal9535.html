<H1>UWP Update 2 </H1>

<H5>by <A HREF="../../credits.html#Pete">Pete Gray</A></H5>

</CENTER>

<HR>
<P>
This is an interpretive update of UWP data in RSB.
This is chiefly to explain changes in data that
occured between 1117 and 1202. This section covers the
coreward portion of the Regency Spinward Marches. This
section covers the  Lunion, Mora, Plankwell, Glisten
and Trin's Shroud Subsectors.
<P>
This data has been confined to the Regency in light of
the major impact of major events like the Abandonment,
Fait Accompli and the Representational Reforms. The
format goes by subsector, broken down into individual
world entries, which are further divided by 1117 and
1202 UWP data, followed by brief comments on the
reason or mechanism of change, and in some cases a
brief explanation for its current conditions.

<h3>Lunion Subsector</h3> Otherwise known as the Spinward
Hub. The major confluence of several trade routes, and
the convergence of the Spinward Main's main branches,
are what make this subsector an essential part of the
Regency economy. While most of the Regency's
industrial base is located in the so called
"Stronghold" region, most corporate headquarters,
administrative centers and the bulk of the Regency's
banks and insurance companies are based on Lunion and
Strouden. Aside from the industrial worlds, most of
the subsector is undeveloped, a situation that is
preferred in many cases by the locals.
<P>
<B>Population (1117/1202):</B>  19.7 Billion/36.8 Billion
<BR><B>Industrial Worlds:</B>  4
<BR><B>Mean Tech Level(1117/1202):</B>  12.1/14.7
<BR><B>Senate Contingent:</B> 127

<h4>Arba         </h4><B>1117:</B> C200200-C
       <BR><B>1202:</B> B200260-C         GA<P>

Arba was a backwater abutting the Abyss, that was
settled to prevent Sword Worlds expansion. Concern
over security, following the Sword World's Landgrab,
prompted the Regency to impose a caretaker Ministry of
Interior administration, which is mostly to monitor
the world, and otherwise keeps out of the locals way.

<h4>Spirelle     </h4><B>1117:</B> C766846-8
       <BR><B>1202:</B> B766976-C         Ab<P>

Spirelle was a pleasant, sleepy agricultural in
antebellum times. But its pleasant nature attracted a
number of Abandonment refugees seeking home both
distant and safe from the ravages of Virus. At first
these refugees were welcomed with open arms. But
different economic priorities and cultural gaps
created conflict between the two communities. Attempts
in 1136 to turn back further immigrants turned into a
violent confrontation, and the immigrants seized large
portions of the planet's surface for their own
segregated communities. The world is widely regarded
as a powderkeg. Much of the population were displaced
by the fighting, and forced into exile within the
larger immigrant cities, where poverty has driven them
to form guerilla groups intent upon equal rights,
reclamation of their land, or just vengeance. The
immigrant communities have themselves balkanised into
about thirty different nations, and a number of low
level wars are ongoing.

<h4>Derchon      </h4><B>1117:</B> C512799-8
       <BR><B>1202:</B> C5128A9-9         **<P>

A minor world of no importance, Derchon's economy
revolves mostly around the port and the extensive
scout base based insystem. Concerns that the world
government was satisfied with the status quo, and
indifferent to seeking alternative industries and
sources of income led to its ouster in a coup by the
head of the colonial army. The new regime has only
enjoyed partial success in attracting new business,
and mostly low-wage paying manufacturing and service
industries.

<h4>Shirene      </h4><B>1117:</B> B984510-B
       <BR><B>1202:</B> B984644-C         CD<P>

Shirene had been the private fiefdom of Al Morai
shipping lines. Seeking to cheaply expand its
development, the company offered Shirene to its
workers as a private community for services,
recreation and retirement, in return for their efforts
at opening up its outback and wilderness. The world is
a "gated" community exclusively reserved for Al Morai
personnel.

<h4>Harvosette   </h4><B>1117:</B> C330737-9
       <BR><B>1202:</B> C330847-A         RR<P>

Harvosette was dominated by a small cabal of merchants
that dominated the local mining industry. Admission
into their rarified club was based upon financial
success, which is hard to come by on this hardscrabble
world. Disgust with the oligarchy culminated in their
ouster by a referendum in 1156.

<h4>Quiru        </h4><B>1117:</B> B365300-8
       <BR><B>1202:</B> B36536A-9         GA<P>

Quiru was placed under RQS jurisdiction in 1141, after
repeated violations of the Quarantine codes. The world
had been a notorious freeport, and SecDets moved in
force to clean up the local startown.

<h4>Gorram       </h4><B>1117:</B> X554220-7
       <BR><B>1202:</B> E554220-7         RR<P>

Gorram was interdicted to protect its primitive
sentient culture. The heavy traffic flow coming down
the Spinward Main convinced the Regency to partially
open the system in 1181 to transiting ship traffic. A
basic frontier port was constructed on a nearby world,
well away from Gorram itself, which is still
interdicted.

<h3>Mora Subsector</h3> While the subsector is at the head
of the Spinward Main, most of its worlds were little
more than stepping stones for passing traders en route
to richer portions of the Marches. In contrast to its
crowded high-pop worlds, the remainder of the
subsector is lightly populated, and possesses few
resources to attract much trade. This changed after
Mora was made capitol of the Domain of Deneb, and it
really changed after it became home to the only other
TL-16 world in the Regency. Despite crowded conditions
on worlds like Fornice and Pallique, the subsector has
enjoyed a major population boom, and now rivals many
former core subsectors in size and wealth. Mora now
has the largest population in the Spinward Marches,
and the third largest in the Regency (Author's note:
this assumes that Gulf suffered major population
losses on Beaxon, otherwise Mora is the fourth
largest).<P>

<B>Population (1117/1202):</B>  40.8 Billion/96.0 Billion
<BR><B>Industrial Worlds:</B>  4
<BR><B>Mean Tech Level(1117/1202):</B>  11.5/14.2
<BR><B>Senate Contingent:</B> 127

<h4>Byret        </h4><B>1117:</B> B485697-6
       <BR><B>1202:</B> B485726-9         RR<P>

Byret had been dominated by a number of major
corporations, operating through its bureaucratic
proxies in the planetary government. These same
companies tried hard to prevent a 1164 referendum
dictated by the Representational Reforms. Their
attempts at currying popular favor permitted them to
retain their commercial properties and current
contracts, but at the cost of being at the whims and
tender mercies of the entire population, through the
new computerised demos government installed as a
result of the referendum.

<h4>Fosey        </h4><B>1117:</B> A633656-A
       <BR><B>1202:</B> A633688-C         RR<P>

Fosey is most notable for being the old regional
records office of the Spinward Marches branch of
Imperial Naval Intelligence. The office was expanded
in the Post-Collapse period, and now serves the RQS in
its efforts at traffickeeping and threat
identification. The old technocratic government was
not up to the task of economic expansion, and the new
bureaucratic government is committed to expanding
industry in the remote outback.

<h4>Duale        </h4><B>1117:</B> A5437BF-B
       <BR><B>1202:</B> A54378A-C         RR<P>

Duale's controlling family was swept from power by a
narrow margin in 1175. Despite the family's wide
unpopularity, its monopoly on much of the world's
economy impeded reform efforts. The new government has
been partially successful in developing alternative
means of income and employment, and has been aided by
the nobles increasingly cynical and violent
recalcitrance.

<h4>Catuz        </h4><B>1117:</B> C22048C-9
      <BR><B>1202:</B> C22067C-B         **<P>

Catuz has been the source of major contention between
a narrow group of wealthy individuals, and disaffected
communities located away from the downport.  A mineral
strike attracted new immigrants, but at the cost of
creating a brief civil war in the 1140s.

<h4>Moran        </h4><B>1117:</B> C367300-8
      <BR><B>1202:</B> C367322-A         GA<P>

Moran's government change was prompted by Regency Navy
complaints about the effect the community's permissive
culture was having on discipline at the local naval
base. The base was expanded for training purposes, and
the subsequent rise in income permitted the locals to
hire a private security service to enforce local laws.


<h4>Pallique     </h4><B>1117:</B> A511966-E
       <BR><B>1202:</B> A5119C7-F         RR<P>

Pallique had been ruled from Mora itself because of
the subsector government's concerns over the perils of
its native environment. The populace thought this to
be overly paternalistic, and voted for home rule in
1155. Pallique has become a "breadbasket" world for
the subsector. Using asteroid hollowing technology
first pioneered by Glisten, several rocks in the main
planetoid belt have been converted into orbiting
farms. These are generally rocks that do not cross
Pallique's elliptical path, though they time their
harvests to coincide with the mainworld's emergence
from the belt, to cut down on shipping costs.

<h4>Nexine       </h4><B>1117:</B> C97A443-8
      <BR><B>1202:</B> C97A554-A         **<P>

Nexine has always been considered to be more of an
experiment than a viable colony. In antebellum times,
the world was colonised by a variety of odd groups,
ranging from geneered humans to oddly xenophobic
communities of Dolphins. The world has attracted a
more mainstream community since the Collapse, and the
current feudal technocracy is the result of the pooled
resources of the various groups, who otherwise keep to
themselves.

<h3>Plankwell Subsector</h3><P>

<B>Population (1117/1202):</B>  10.1 Billion/21.9 Billion
(includes non-regency population.)
<BR><B>Industrial Worlds:</B>  3
<BR><B>Mean Tech Level(1117/1202):</B>  9.6/9.3
<BR><B>Senate Contingent:</B> 74


<h4>Shvreeyiyi   </h4><B>1117:</B> E532000-8
       <BR><B>1202:</B> D5325E2-2         GA<P>

This is a reclassification based upon the belated
recognition of the native Shrieker minor race.
Overflight of the world is prohibited within 10
diameters, except for arrivals and departures at the
downport and the nearby scout base. Traders are
allowed to travel overland to set aside trade stations
on the periphery of the Shrieker's territory, but are
prevented from entering the Valley of Souls by their
own security, and Scout surveillance units in orbit.

<h4>Avastan      </h4><B>1117:</B> C433520-A
       <BR><B>1202:</B> C433543-B         **<P>

Avastan was bitterly divided over joining the Regency,
and the population voted by referendum to remain
independent. But the referendum also installed a
Regency friendly government, which has been very
solicitious of the local RQS and the 184th Fleet.  The
world has a large RQS contingent stationed to keep an
eye on the independent Sword Worlds, and to prevent
end runs around the Quarantine via non-aligned
Plankwell worlds.

<h4>Bowman       </h4><B>1117:</B> D000300-9
      <BR><B>1202:</B> C000421-B         CD<P>

Repeated travails with Ling Standard Products led to
the formation of a government on Koenig's Rock in
1142. The new government is an effective participatory
state, as the population take turns in the local
virtual parliament according to a rotating assignment
system.  Because of the system's scattered
settlements, most government is by long range video
conferencing.  Suffrage is dispensed by residental
registration, which obligates an immigrant to staying
at least two years in system in order to fully enjoy
their rights.

<h4>Talos        </h4><B>1117:</B> E333532-9
      <BR><B>1202:</B> C333643-A         RR<P>

One of several worlds induced to join the Regency in
the early 1130s. Talos' ruling elite initially refused
to honor the outcome of the 1163 referendum that
ousted them from power, and they attempted to secede
from the Regency. A Regency Marine strike force
quickly changed their minds.

<h4>Dawnworld    </h4><B>1117:</B> E885000-0
       <BR><B>1202:</B> D885160-A         CD<P>

This virgin world was finally opened to outside
development in 1141.  The local administration is
primarily the Ministry of the Interior, though this
might change as the Frontier heats up.

<h4>Pagaton      </h4><B>1117:</B> C769873-4
       <BR><B>1202:</B> C769973-6         Ab<P>

Despite its heavily balkanised nature, Pagaton
recieved massive offworld immigration from Deneb
sector.  Only about half of the world's nations are
members of the Regency, thanks mostly to this inflow.
The remainder are largely left alone by the national
and subsector governments. The highport and downport
are Regency controlled, and all shipments into the
system are under the aegis of the Quarantine.

<h4>Millie Falcs </h4><B>1117:</B> B9A2469-C
       <BR><B>1202:</B> A9A248A-E         RR<P>

The military government was replaced in referendum in
1158. The naval base remains an important facility,
but the world's economy has boomed from the growing
intersection of trade from both the Aslan and
non-Regency space in nearby Trojan Reach and
Plankwell.

<h3>Glisten Subsector</h3> The subsector is at the
transition between the Thinrim to the Hub to coreward
and the Stronghold to trailing. Glisten has undergone
major changes, as a result of the fait accompli
adjustments, though not as severe as neighboring
subsectors in Trojan Reach. Like many Thinrim
communities, attitudes towards the Aslan are
ambivalent and conflicted. Aslan trade is eagerly
welcomed, but oppressive fait accompli governments
elicit rage even within mixed Aslan-Human communities
on neighboring worlds, and the Thinrim riots of the
1160s were perhaps most severe here. Despite these
tensions, the massive industrial plants of Glisten
itself attracted a major number of immigrants from the
Abandonment, and even other regions of the Safe. The
subsector is so important and dynamic, that it enjoyed
a five point jump in average tech level, a remarkable
improvement for what had been a remote borderland
before.
<P>
<B>Population (1117/1202):</B>  30.4 Billion/ 82.8 Billion
<BR><B>Industrial Worlds:</B>  6
<BR><B>Mean Tech Level(1117/1202):</B>  8.4/13.4
<BR><B>Senate Contingent:</B> 185


<h4>Grote        </h4><B>1117:</B> A400404-B
       <BR><B>1202:</B> A400415-E         **<P>

Formerly known as DeGroat. Grote had been a major
constructor of small custom built starships in the
antebellum period. General Products purchased the
shipyard in the late 1140s, and the world has been a
quiet corporate enclave ever since. Its product line
has changed little, though its quality of construction
has expanded enormously.

<h4>Melior       </h4><B>1117:</B> D140466-7
       <BR><B>1202:</B> C140477-8         **<P>

Melior was formerly a Ministry of Colonisation base
world. The governor and his staff fled in 1120, after
a sizeable Aslan force landed at the downport. The
Aslan eventually decided that the world was fairly
useless, and most left for more promising locations.
The various communities are divided between normal
humans and Jonkereen, and poor relations between the
two groups led to its current balkanisation.

<h4>Aiaoheah     </h4><B>1117:</B> C86A410-9
       <BR><B>1202:</B> C86A6N9-9         FA<P>

Formerly known as Aster. This frigid water world was
largely abandoned by its human population in the face
of Aslan aggression, and the new clan, a vassal of the
Aokhalte bloc, wasted no time in claiming it for their
own. Aiaoheah has few useful resources, though, aside
from largely inaccessible mineral bodies under the
world icepack, and unemployment has been only allayed
by the world's status as an interface port.

<h4>Windsor      </h4><B>1117:</B> C783511-9
      <BR><B>1202:</B> C783634-9         CD<P>

Windsorcorp had great difficulty in rooting out Ihatei
invaders after the fait accompli declaration.  In many
cases it imported armed "colonists" recruited on Aki,
and granted them landholds in return for their efforts
in eliminating the trespassers. The world is now
dominated by large landholds governed by descendants
of the original corporate hiearchy.

<h4>Hwealaitlaw  </h4><B>1117:</B> C573674-6
       <BR><B>1202:</B> C5737M3-3         FA<P>

Formerly known as Craw. This has always been a grim
world. Evidence exists of an ancient culture that had
destroyed itself in a nuclear exchange that still
polluts the atmosphere with fallout debris. The world
became even more grim in the aftermath of being
declared fait accompli. The local human population had
been displaced by the invading Aslan Tui'yueh clan,
and have lived a poor, desperate existence in the
world's outback.

<h4>Aki          </h4><B>1117:</B> B443987-9
       <BR><B>1202:</B> A443ACC-C         RR<P>

Aki's original bureaucratic government was mostly
ineffective at controlling the restive, overcrowded
population. The Aslan clans that invaded in 1119
quickly conquered the world, but had even greater
difficulty in controlling the outraged population.
Escalating brutality hardened the local resistance,
culminating in "Trooper" Mctavish's raid on the
government compound in 1122.  The ferocity of the
local resistance cowed even the most fanatical Aslan
clans, who were only too willing to return the world
they referred to as the "Valley of Bloody Death" back
to the Domain of Deneb in 1131.  The local resistance
leaders fought among themselves until 1143, and the
survivors rode their popularity into a new unified
government. The current government is primarily
composed of popular military heroes, who now days come
primarily from the Frontier or the Wilds.

<h4>Tailealres   </h4><B>1117:</B> E48569A-2
       <BR><B>1202:</B> D4857LB-5         FA<P>

Formerly known as Sorel. The world is controlled by
the Eakhitiyo bloc. The subjugated human population's
living conditions are the worst of any fait accompli
world, a fact that leads to daily acts of desperate
violence by rebels. A wealthy agricultural world.

<h4>Romar        </h4><B>1117:</B> B450456-B
      <BR><B>1202:</B> A450576-D         FA<P>

Large sections of Romar were surrendered to no less
than thirty five different Aslan clans in 1132. Many
of these clans fought over the world's Dustspice
fields in the 1120s, preventing the expulsion of the
human population. Currently, the world's Dustspice
trade is controlled by a single cartel of six clans,
to whom the other clans swear allegiance.  The human
populace is clustered primarily around the downport,
and have little to do with the Aslan in the outback,
aside from trade and commercial contact.

<h4>Marastan     </h4><B>1117:</B> D868772-5
       <BR><B>1202:</B> B868794-9         GA/RR<P>

Marastan had been bitterly divided between warring
clans. Repeated attempts by megacorps to intervene in
these petty wars generally made the situation worse, a
case of blowback that threatened this vitally
important world. The declaration of Quarantine saw the
confiscation of the corps mercenary units and private
arsenals, largely defusing the crisis. A new unified
government was formulated by the RISS in the late
1130s, one that was above any one faction.

<h4>Ftaokhaolye  </h4><B>1117:</B> C795300-A
       <BR><B>1202:</B> C7953K4-A         FA<P>

Formerly known as Wurzburg. The world only supported a
small population of human runaways, and it put up only
feeble resistance when it was seized by the Aslan in
1119. Most of the original human population remained,
despite their new overlords.

<h3>Trin' Shroud Subsector</h3> Trin itself is too well
documented elsewhere to require inclusion in this
listing. The destruction of that world had major
impact upon the subsector, for Trin virtually was the
heart of the local economy. The rest of the subsector
seems to have been settled almost as an afterthought.
A number of worlds were colonised simply because they
were there. Some of these systems recieved new
immigrants as the result of the Rape or the
Abandonment, but the destruction of the subsectors
main employers on Trin caused many more to leave for
Mora or Gulf, and the subsector has been in decline
ever since.<P>

       <BR><B>1202:</B> E5665L9-4         FA<P>

Formerly known as Pyramus. Roihye was "gifted" to
Ikhtealyo clan as part of the fait accompli
arrangements, superseding the claim of a smaller
independent clan. The ruling Kiriwine family was
compensated with a fief on Ffudn.

<h4>Thisbe       </h4><B>1117:</B> E4305AD-5
       <BR><B>1202:</B> E430599-7         RR<P>

Thisbe's last dictatorship was ousted after the world
began to recieve more offworld investment by
interested commercial parties in Gazulin subsector.

<h4>Aramis       </h4><B>1117:</B> B659772-6
      <BR><B>1202:</B> B659883-9         RR<P>

A world war in the 1080s between the Indocor Alliance
and the Polity of Brushinem) involving a limited
nuclear exchange elicited Imperial intervention. After
a short period of occupation, a popular backlash
developed against violence in general. This pacifism
was sorely tested by Aslan Ihatei incursions in the
early 1120s, but the local population has remained
true to their vision of world peace. A unified
government was voted into power in 1152, just six days
after notification of the Representational Reforms
arrived from Mora.

<h4>Keltcher     </h4><B>1117:</B> C535567-9
       <BR><B>1202:</B> C535588-A         RR<P>

Keltcher was originally under Imperial Army control, a
reflection of the world's use as a OPFOR training
facility. In the antebellum period, Army and a few
Marine units travelled here for training by
"aggressor" divisions in Zhodani, Aslan and Sword
World tactics and equipment. The Quarantine, and the
subsequent improvement in relations between BTC
powers, caused a shift in priorities, and caused a
considerable dropoff in use of the facility as units
were shifted to the Frontier to fight Virus. The
world's army governor was replaced with one from
MoInterior, and eventually the world was granted home
rule during the Reforms. New tensions with the Zhodani
in the wake of the Exodus has prompted an upsurge of
activity at the facility, even though its size has
been diminished by nearby economic development.

<h4>Tussinian    </h4><B>1117:</B> B678324-7
       <BR><B>1202:</B> B678333-9         **<P>

This is a RISS reclassification. Tussinian's
represenative democracy was a mere formality. The real
power on the world resides with the owners of the
world's lucrative starport industries, with little
input from the other scattered groups that dot the
world.

<h4>Leander      </h4><B>1117:</B> E695233-5
       <BR><B>1202:</B> E695244-5         **<P>

Leander is the self-described "Boredom Capitol of
Known Space." The mostly flat and uninviting world
underwent a minor government change in 1145, though in
truth no one really noticed aside from the scouts.

<h4>Katarulu     </h4><B>1117:</B> B252665-B
       <BR><B>1202:</B> B252686-D         ROT<P>

The military dominated world was the only natural
choice for a new subsector capitol after the Rape of
Trin.

<h4>Youghal      </h4><B>1117:</B> AA95365-B
       <BR><B>1202:</B> AA95475-C         ROT<P>

Youghal was subject to Trin. In the aftermath of the
Rape, the world was de facto independent, though not
recognised as such until 1142. A number of small
commercial groups fled Trin, and in the chaos
following the Kishkii's attack, seized several
unpopulated regions of the world for themselves.
Youghal is partially elliptical, though not enough to
recieve the appropriate code.

<h4>Zephyr       </h4><B>1117:</B> X89556A-3
       <BR><B>1202:</B> X895546-4         GA<P>

A rebellion against the Third Imperium led to this
world's interdiction before the Fifth Frontier War.
Lingering hostilities have led to de facto
independence, and the red zone remains in place.

<h4>Hazel        </h4><B>1117:</B> C645747-5
     <BR><B>1202:</B> B645747-9         GA<P>

Hazel was controlled by major criminal syndicates in
the antebellum and Civil War periods. MoJ operations,
in conjunction with local authorities, broke the back
of these syndicates.
