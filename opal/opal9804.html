Viceroy is briefly described in <cite>Traveller's Digest</cite> 20, and is the
subject of the Grand Tour Adventure therein.
<P>
Viceroy possesses a high dense atmosphere that becomes
a liquid within its deep crevices and valleys.
Colonists initially bypassed the world in their
initial settlement waves of the subsector. It was
impossible to surmount the high dense atmosphere with
whatever resources and technology available to the
Rule of Man era, and it was folly to even try. It
wasn't until the 750s that settlement of the world was
finally achieved.

<P>
The world was owned and managed by a sequence of
different mining and development companies that were
exhausted by the expensive automated systems and
remote mining operations required to extract Viceroy's
rich mineral resources.  The world eventually became
the property of Vorkash Manufacturing, a company then
very active within the Spinward Hinters. Vorkash
eliminated the bulky automated methods, and converted
to a labor intensive system of manned mining. Vorkash
sank a series of vertical mine shafts in the
highlands, and constructed a radiating network of
underground tunnels that reached the various ore
bodies.  Several large orbital habitats were
constructed for employees, who shuttled down for
uninterrupted six day work shifts.

<P>
While this finally made Viceroy a profitable venture,
the dangerous conditions within the mines, and the
crowded, squalid living quarters the miners were
given, made it difficult to hire and retain workers.
Fearful of losing profits, the companies unscrupulous
RGM (Regional General Manager) created a kidnapping ring that shanghaied members
of a human minor race on nearby Halka (0510), and
brought thousands to work the mines as slave labor. A
group of travellers stumbled across this operation in
1121, and revealed it to the Florian authorities. The
RGM and his cohorts were imprisoned, and Vorkash was
forced to submit to outside inspections of the
facilities.

<P>
The Post-Collapse period intensified corporate
competition within the Hinters, and Vorkash was forced
to merge or sell it various divisions to its
competitors. The world is currently owned by a
division of a company named Anaconda-AX, a former
division of LSP.  Anaconda sails very close to the
wind in most of its operations, and the Florian League
has closely scrutinised its operations since it bought
out the world in 1154. The company has begun to phase
out the cumbersome manned system in favor of new
automated systems specifically designed for long term
use under local conditions. Manufacturing complexes
have begun to spring up in the higher elevations or in
orbit, a most of the labor force has shifted towards
skilled professionals.
