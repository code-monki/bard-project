  <P>
Gothe is one of the Sisters' newest colonised worlds.
Only settled in the period just prior to the Fifth
Frontier War, it seemed that the project was something
of a white elephant.  The Ministry of Colonisation
pushed it only as a pawn on the bureaucratic
chessboard back at Capitol, and as a defiant gesture
towards the Third Imperium's enemies.  Otherwise the
world had few redeeming qualities.  Its poverty and
confinement to primitive domed cities led to the
creation of a restrictive bureaucratic government
under the Ministry's supervision, and rather draconian
laws reminsicent of Quhaiathat's (which see).
 <P>
The Quarantine proved to be the world's savior. It
became the main J-1 connecter from the main port at
Mirriam and traffic moving along the main Spin Main
trade routes from Raschev (Foreven 3230) and Emape. A
massive RQS presence was soon stationed to inspect
traffic coming across the border, and had the perverse
effect of both strengthening and complicating the
world governments power.
 <P>
With the demise of the Ministry of Colonisation, the
government has felt the fiscal sting of going it alone
without outside assistance. It plays a double game,
supporting the RQS to the hilt, often demanding an
expansion of its presence on the world in excess even
of the massive bivouac it already maintains, all with
the purpose of creating a steady income stream for the
world and its inhabitants.  But most of the money ends
up with the government, who trickles it out to
maintain public support.
 <P>
The highest ministers are quite corrupt, and they have
a finger in every enterprise that caters to either the
RQS or the port. Because of the constant stream of
traffic, they can impose higher port fees, and hassle
incoming ship crews with unnecessary bureaucratic
meddling until a bribe is paid. The paucity with which
money is doled out by the local ministries, and the
larcenous behavior of high officials, often encourages
lower ranking officials and the average gentlebeing in
the street to emulate their betters and even try to
outdo them in graft and gouging.  It has been remarked
that most local law enforcement is bent towards either
of two goals: collecting bribes or supressing groups
that compete with them for bribes.
 <P>
The shamelessness of this customary venality is summed
up in a popular local joke: "Regency Express: You
didn't leave home without it?"
