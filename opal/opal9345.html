Another obscure agricultural world on the edge of the
Avalar Consulate. Totashev is unusually dense for its
size, is somewhat warmer than Terra. It has a single
supercontinent, Smoots Land, located mostly within the
equatorial zone, and all local evidence points to its
creation being a recent tectonic event. Ninety percent
of the world's continental crust is concentrated here,
and this has created a fairly uniform set of flora and
fauna thanks to a recent mass extinction.
<P>
This uniformity attracted Zhodani settlers early in
the 200s. With only a few ecological climes to settle,
exploitation would be simpler. The world's
agricultural output would be more consistent than
normal. And the warm, tropical climate would permit
year-round cultivation.  Fruit farming, Noql "ranches"
and grazing ranges were quickly established, and the
small colony soon developed an export economy that
sent fresh produce and meat back to the Consulate's
growing Foreven holdings year round.
<P>
Unfortunately, the settlers discovered that same
uniformity made the local ecology more sensitive to
heavy intrusion.  With less diversity in species and
soils, the world was more vulnerable to reckless
development, poisoning by toxins, and the introduction
of offworld parasites.  The first settlers nearly
wrecked the world in their carelessness.  An
ecological "crash" and extinction episode caused soil
fertility to collapse in the 440s, and famine killed
about forty percent of the population. Its export
economy was disrupted, and the survivors abandoned
interstellar contact and migrated into the outback.
<P>
When the colonists were recontacted in 451, most
refused evacuation or massive outside assistance. Most
were now reliant upon a milder subsistence existence,
and pretty much turned their backs upon the Consulate
and the rest of the universe.  This rejection was tied
into a fear of having to readjust to a new world if
they were evacuated, and just plain stubborness and
anger over their previous failure. The Zhodani
government was dismayed by this atypical attitude, and
thereafter listed the world as "unabsorbed" and left
the locals pretty much alone.
<P>
The Avalar Consulate recieved the world as part of the
Titan Transfer in the late 600s, but did not attempt
contact of the locals until 713. They found the
Zhodani population as recalcitrant as before, and made
little headway in opening the world to further outside
contact. Nevertheless the world was renamed to
Totashev, and was opened to outside colonisation in
724.  Most new colonists were of Imperial culture, and
found the insular indigenous population intractable. A
number of range wars broke out between the "Injun
Joes" and the mostly Solomani new arrivals, and these
eventually took on genocidal tones.
<P>
Unfortunately for the "Settlers", the wisdom of the
Zhodani's adaptation was forced home after a massive
crop failure in 886 threatened them with famine. Food
relief efforts by the Avalar government staved off
famine, but subsequent crop failures weakened and
bankrupted the colony, and eventually the Zhodani
decisively defeated the Settler government forces in
911, and effectively took control of the planet.
<P>
The two populations have merged over the last two
hundred and ninety years, and a mixed culture has
emerged. The local economy is a mixture of ecological
farming combined with light industry. A few high-value
products are raised for export, but for the most part
the world and its population are self-sufficient. A
number of offices and empowered individuals normally
encountered with Solomani primitives, such as healers
and shamans, enjoy an unusual level of status, and in
many cases enjoy psionic talents (to the dismay of
skeptics and progressives everywhere).
<P>
The local government is a Solomani-style parliamentary
system with a few twists of Zhodani origin. Psionics
are wholly embraced locally, though the Solomani
distrust of police coercion, and the local Zhodani's
distrust of complex political arrangements have
prevented any equivalent of the Tavrchedl from
developing. Local bloodlines have become so thoroughly
mixed, and cultural distinctions so blurred, that few
if any resentments linger along ethnic lines.
<P>
The Avalar Consulate still finds the locals to be
recalcitrant and intractable, and the world is pretty
much left alone by higher authority. Its culture has
attracted a fair number of Zhodani refugees, who also
find their "cousins" to be difficult to deal with.
