(A version of Dekha is bundled in Galactic 2.4. See

<A href=http://zho.berka.com/data/TNE/writeup.pl?loc=1128&planY=Dekhaï¿½or=DENEB&realsubname=Vincennes&subsector=SEC_J.DAT&subsectorletter=J">Dekha</A>
for details. However my version of Dekha was written
up before I had access to Galactic, and I prefer it to
the RICE paper.)<P>

In hindsight, there seemed to exist in the old
Imperium a hubristic if not suicidal impulse on the
part of some high population worlds, specifically
those small barren rocks minus an atmosphere or
hydrosphere. As these worlds grew in population into
the tens of billions, the impulse of their governments
was to contruct "snailshells", literally massive
concentric buildings that covered the entire globe
from pode to antipode in metal, ceramic and plastic.
Such worlds took on the appearance of a metallic
mollusk, gleaming in the starry sky against the
backlight of glittering towers that pierced the shell
like waving antenna.<P>
The only problem with this arrangement was its sheer
inefficiency. Megastructures of this size created
massive containment problems when placed in a vacuum.
Solid structures of any kind leak air and water to
some minute degree; but when there are exposed
structures and seams to the degree of tens or hundreds
of square miles, "minute" can mean buckets. And then
there is the problem of heating and cooling such a
structure in an affordable way. And they were built
and designed in a dehumanising brute force method that
left little consideration for comfort or communal
identity. Safety standards were hard to enforce in
buildings on this scale, built as they often were in
rapid sucession. In other words they were drafty
uncomfortable slums on a titanic scale. Naturally
Virus turned such well made deathtraps into killing
fields, blasting people into space, killing them with
automated machinery, asphyxiating them in fires or by
bleeding off the air, drowning them in water main
bursts.. etc..<P>

Dekha was first settled in 186 by Vilani settlers from
Dagudashaag sector. Unlike most vacuum world
colonists, these lacked the resources or the
wherewithal to build exposed structures on the
surface; and the local asteroid and comet orbits made
bombardment of the surface a real threat. As a result
they dug massive warrens underground. Because of its
proximity to a pair of large asteroid belts, including
one possessing nearly inexhaustable amounts of
nickel-iron and other heavy elements, the system was
industrialised early on. By utilising the so called
"fishbowl effect" industrial facilities could be built
anywhere, and on a massive but affordable scale as raw
materials and finished goods were carried by conveyor,
pipeline or rail to facilities around the
circumference of the planet. Because the population
built underground, heating/cooling and life support
costs were greatly lowered. The frozen surface
prevented air and water from leaking into space, and
simplified structural construction.
<P>
Dekha is known as the Piggybank of Deneb. As wealth
increased, the local government was able to afford the
installation of more artificial gravity in inhabited
areas, and built a massive water reservoir at the
planetary core over the centuries, expanding it a
little at a time till its internal capacity was
greater than many oceans, filled with cometary debris
or raw materials brought from nearby "Warm Jupiters."
Despite a lack of sophisticated starport facilities,
local industry advanced to the highest levels attained
in the Third Imperium. With increasing leisure time
came more experimentation into science and advanced
engineering, and the creation of the local Imperial
University system of colleges and technical schools.
<P>
Since the Collapse, Dekha has become one of the most
important worlds in the Regency. Government money and
private investment have taken advantage of its highly
educated workforce, and well developed infrastructure
to make the world one of the largest shipbuilders in
the Spinward Extents. The population has increased
heavily, and expansion of the underground arcos has
accelerated for the possibility of a hundred billion
citizens. Dekha is banging on the TL-16 door, and is
considered to be a distant second to Vincennes in
technological advancement. Its rivalry with the
Emerald City goes back centuries, and has heated up
since Vincennes became more engaged in offworld
affairs. The rivalry is mostly friendly competition,
as both worlds recognise the need for cooperation, and
for advancing local technological levels. But it has
its rough spots as the incomplete naval bases above
both worlds, the victims of mutual political wrangling
and meddling.
