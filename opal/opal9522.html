   <P>
 Ator was originally settled by the Darrians around
-1250 as a refueling and resupply center for transport
ships moving between the homeworld and colonies in
Five Sisters and Plankwell subsectors. The local
population was stranded by the Maghiz, and died out
around -1080, the victims of failing life support
systems.
 <P>
In the early years of the Imperial expansion into the
Marches, a Solomani extended family, the Telesco, came
across the now deserted world and its Darrian
settlement.  Comprising about two hundred individuals,
the family took over the empty base and converted it
to their own use.  When the Darrians returned to the
system in 124, the Telescos refused to give allegiance
to them and return the world to the Confederacy. When
the Darrians persisted, the new inhabitants invoked
eminent domain and threatened to drag the Confederacy
into the Imperial courts.
 <P>
While the Darrians retreated from the system after
this standoff, they never reconciled to the Telesco or
their control, and made various attempts at pressuring
them into Confederacy control. Unfortunately for their
plans, the world's strategic location brought a steady
stream of ships wending their way along the old
Darrian trade route between Daryen and neighboring
subsectors, enriching the Telescos.  And the Sword
Worlds were keenly interested in having the world for
themselves, which led to the world being a de facto
DMZ between the two states. The world was the scene of
battles between both states during the Third Frontier
War, but both sides withdrew at the end of the war.
 <P>
This standoff would have persisted to the present day,
if it hadn't been for the Sworld World Landgrab of
1132. The Sword World military seized Ator in force,
imprisoned the Telescos, and vandalised the starport.
The Sword Worlders remained on the world until 1135,
when DCN Marines ousted them after a bloody meteoric
assualt, and rescued the Telescos.  With the starport
in ruins, and having little money to rebuild, the
family swallowed their pride and accepted Darrian
sovereignty.  The Confederacy salved their pride by
reconfirming the family as Ator's hereditary
governors, and by rebuilding property destroyed by the
Sworld Worlders.
 <P>
While the Telescos have had some difficulty adjusting
to their new overlords, the change in sovereignty
brought new prosperity to them and their world. The
closest Darrian world to the Spin Main traffic coming
up from <A href=9508.html">Mirriam</A> - Five Sisters to Flammarion, and a mere
two parsecs from  <A href=9518.html">Debarre</A>, most low jump traffic from
the main must pass through the system.  An SSIIO and
its attendant RQS/DQS personnel are posted here, and
the combination of customs fees, government subsidies
and business from passing ship crews have made the
Telescos and their people wealthy beyond anything they
were in the past.
