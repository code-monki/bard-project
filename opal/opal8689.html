Muntgumree is a Regency naval and scout reserve. The
world is a primary training and exercise facility for
naval and marine units in rim-trailing Deneb. Most of
the world's surface is reserved for military
exercises, and is off-limits to civilians. Despite
this prohibition, the world has a sizeable civilian
population. Most civilians live in the confines of
Muckglocken Down, a large industrial center located on
the shores of a large freshwater lake in the northern
latitudes. Nearly everything produced and consumed by
the local population goes in or out of the port, and
the world produces a wide range of TL 9-11 products
for export. Because of restrictions on land use, all
of the worlds food must be imported, and these are
paid for by high value/high risk industries such as
petrochemical refining, explosives and fertilizer
manufacturing, biotech and pharmaceuticals, and
manufacture subcontracting. As compensation, most of
the higher end technical and management positions are
filled by locals, as their education system is very
sophisticated for a small world.
