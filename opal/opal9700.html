The Grudovo Pendant is a j-1 cluster of 13 worlds that
connects Tobia/Trojan Reach with neighboring
Usher/Reft. Originally a cluster of little economic
presence or importance, its economic value has risen
in proportion with the rising volume of trade that
passes between Lintl and Tobia.<P>

Grudovo is another important link world on the Rim
Highway. Its port is unusually large, as it services
the large bulk freighters and container carriers of
the major shipping lines. In antebellum times, the
world produced electrical components for export to
industrial worlds like Tobia. The world was originally
owned by Sagashimur Technical, a Naasirka subsidiary
that produced generation equipment and infrastructure.
Production was halted by the Civil War, but resumed in
response to massive demand for Virus resistant power
systems. All of the world's water comes from
harvesting of Oort cloud material insystem, years of
poor environmental controls having polluted local
ground water with large concentrations of chemical
solvents and heavy metals.
