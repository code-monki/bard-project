Homeworld of the Orpheeide minor race. When the race
was first discovered in 1003 by Serendip explorers, a
debate thinly veiling the ongoing imperial competition
erupted between several Islands powers over
sovereignty. Under IISS prodding a convention was
signed that placed the planet and its natives
offlimits to offworld contact, mostly to offset the
ambitions of New Colchis and Esperanza.

<P>
The "Orfies" are a hexapedal herbivorous species that
is actually quite old in lineage.  They are very well
adapted to their homeworld, and their technological
development has stagnated.  For many offworlders this
docile and an inoffensive race offered an easily
enslavable work force who would put up no resistance
to exploitation of them or their world. When the
Islands War erupted, New Colchis and Joyeuse fought
for control, with the former eventually the victor,
and the Orpheeides were rounded up into labor camps by
the victorious occupation troops. When Regency forces
arrived in 1140, they found the New Colchisians still
in place; unlike in other parts of the Islands, the
Regency showed no restraint, and the occupation force
was routed and slaughtered by Regency Marines as an
example to their fellows.

<P>
Today Orphee is a full member of the Regency. A RISS
watch force is maintained full time, but the world is
not interdicted, and full offworld trade ties exist.
