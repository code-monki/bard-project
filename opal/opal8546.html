Cunha's population balkanised about 800 years ago for
reasons that no one on the world can remember.
Offworld historians think that the colonists seperated
over issues of fair trade and taxation. All that is
clear today are the bitter differences that continue
to isolate the locals from one another. Cunha is not
the most pleasant of worlds, and each nation had long
ago turned inwards to concentrate on individual
survival. Imperial sovereignty was universally
acknowledged on the world, since the Imperial
government was the only supernational institution
worthy of recognition. The Imperial Civil War and the
Collapse has weakened the local isolationism, but has
done little to foster national unity.  Each nation
gets by on cottage and light industries that produce a
number of well made articles, particularly textiles
and metal implements, for offworld export. Trade has
increased significantly since the Collapse, and will
increase further with the designation of the world as
a Safeside terminus. This increased economic
competition has worsened local relations, as local
tradewars have been sparked by contention over export
dominance.
