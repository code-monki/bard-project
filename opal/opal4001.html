Since the Rule of Man Pesuuzu was ruled by the Aahasu family.  The
Family kept to itself, ruling the people with an iron fist. In the
later days of the Imperium, the family doted on their numerous robots
and experimented with cybernetic enhancements, both of themselves
and their retainers. Sometimes condemned criminals were used in the
trials of more exeperimental devices.  The Family was feared and hated
by the residents of the world, who the family refered to as tenants.
The head of the family, Baron Rohgish, was often refered to as the
Robot Baron of Aahsu.<P>

During the Rebellion, a group of ex-security forces, lead a succesful
rebellion against the family, who fled to the southern artic regions, where
they started a resistance movement. The movement, wasn't very succesful,
but it made occasional attacks against the new Civil Defense Force, as the
new government called itself.  These were more a nuisence, but still hundreds of people died in the attacks between 1128 and 1130.  (Virus release date)<P>

The world was devestated by the Virus, and about half of the 20,000
people perished.  The land was left a burning wreck, but out of the southern icefields, an army emerged.  This was the remenents of the Aahsu family forces, and this time the Robot Baron was actually a robot. An Aashu family warbot had seized control of the army, killed off the surviving members of the family, and declared itself the rightful Baron Aahsu.  It then lead its army of virus infected robots and cyborgs on a crusade to conquor the rest of the planet.<P>

In 1200, the Baron has divided the planet into a series of fuedal domains,
each controlled by a robot or cyborg, who has sworn alleigence to him.  The
surviving human serfs till the fields and obey the word of their unliving
lords. They are a primitive, and supersitious lot. There is no education
system anymore and they are iliterate.<P>

The Baron controlls the only high tech factory capable of replacing
parts for the robots.  Though it can not build new robots.  It can
build new cybernetic parts, and humans which please the Baron are
granted cybernetic organs, and allowed to become part of the Iron Horde.<P>
