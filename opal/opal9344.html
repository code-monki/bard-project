Evaberi was one of three worlds settled by <a href="opal9343.html">Titan</A> and
its government during a commercial squabble with
Hepring and the adjoining Torinsk cluster in the 800s.
Unlike <a href="opal9338.html">Spokes</A>, Evaberi and Pudimon were intended to be
working colonies from the beginning.  Surveys showed
that the system had rich nickel-iron asteroid belts,
and Evaberi was settled to process and protect these
resources against outside intrusion.
<P>
About 920, however, the economic focus of the system
began to shift.  Agriculture was becoming too
expensive for the homeworld, and the population was
growing too fast for food imports to be a viable
option. However, Evaberi itself is located within its
primary's life zone, and has significant amounts of
water in its thick ice caps.  Vacuum world agriculture
was then a nascent science, and the central Titan
government decided to invest money and time into the
new technology with the end of converting the world
into a breadbasket system. This way it was hoped to
reduce pressure on its increasingly overworked farms,
and stave off food shortages.
<P>
Using a new technique imported from the Third
Imperium, Titan and Consulate engineers began
"Ballooning" portions of Evaberi's crust through
thermal expansion by lasers and low-yield fusion
bombs. A "Muck-stack" of imported organic materials
and local dirt were then constructed within the large
(1-5 km diameter) voids, both to provide a growing
medium, moisture retention and provide structural
integrity. Sunlight would be shined down a series of
mirror-lined tunnels from the surface, and extra water
and nutrients would be piped in by a close circuit
system.  The crops would grow in a sealed atmosphere
enriched in CO2, and charged with a low level
microwave field to enhance growth.
<P>
For all of the investment placed within Evaberi's
farms, the return was less than was hoped for.  While
farming has been competitively priced compared to
normal agricultural worlds, the high initial
investment and early technical problems drained
government support from the project, and it had been
abandoned by Titan in 1054.  Most of the farms were
either left to rot or were dismantled, though a few of
the more productive farms were transferred to the
colonists. Because they possess the only such farms in
the entire Consulate, it has become a competitive
boon, as they allow Evaberi to reduce it food imports
for only a small sacrifice of skilled labor.
<P>
Since the troubles on Titan in the 1150s, Evaberi has
been in an economic slump. The economic interuption by
the Titan Civil War has limited the local market for
ores and metals, and the world had suffered severe
unemployment exaceberated by the loss in funding from
the homeworld. As a result there has been a revival in
interest in the still intact farms abandoned by the
Evaberi government. Some of these farms have been
repaired, restocked and converted into hothouses for
the cultivation of expensive and hard to get
commodities for Avalar's growing middle class markets.
But rumors also abound that many more have been
converted to the growth of contraband medicinals and
narcotics, also for export. It is percieved that the
colonial government is using the profits from this
industry to uplift its flagging mineral extraction
sectors, and possibly provide the means for the world
to declare independence from its moribund parent.
