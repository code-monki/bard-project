Taormina's local ecosystem has developed a number of
deadly lifeforms that use poison to defend themselves
against predation. Toxins are everpresent in the local
air and water, and heavy filtration equipment is
required to prevent infiltration. The reason for human
inhabitance of this world is its rich mineral
resources, and the heavy offworld demand creates a
high local living standard. This level of local
comfort can lull the inhabitants into complacency
about safety practices, and a local dictator is
elected from the military or the safety services to
enfore the safety code.
<P>
The severe local laws are mostly common sense
regulations to prevent a breach of life support by
contaminated air and water; but in many cases the
punishments are very severe. The safety services are
exempted from the local economy, and most members
soldier on for years on paltry pay in the face of
constant danger, ensuring their loyalty and vigilance.
Many offworlders question this vigilance, wondering if
the threat is actually that pronounced, but they find
only a hostile reception to their voiced doubts.
