Amshal has always been preserved by the subsector
nobility as a natural park for the enjoyment of
themselves and other Imperial subjects. Most of the
original population lived in scattered rural
communities, often sponsored or supported by generous
subsidies provided by the subsector government.
<P>
Local society is closely tied to Deneb; while most of
the population eschews To Will One Thing, a suprising
number of local citizens worked in universities,
government ministries and corporate offices. Despite
the leisurely life of their homeworld, local work
ethic is very strong, and higher education is
stressed. In most cases this cosmopolitan background
became a selling point for migrants looking for work
on Deneb, as they were often better educated than the
majority of citizens on that world. This trend has
accelerated since the Representational Reforms, and
Amshali administrators are as indispensable to Deneb
and To Will One Thing as Bwap bureaucrats were to the
antebellum Imperium.
<P>
The annihilation of the Imperium brought millions of
refugees to the world, swamping local resources. About
half of the population still lives in crowded refugee
camps, though these are slowly emptying as more
housing is made available. Most of these people are
still outside the local mainstream, and while the
natives were enjoying posh jobs on Deneb or in the
subsector government, they were working in menial
jobs. Fortunately tensions have been alleviated by the
ascension of a new civil service government since the
Rep. Reforms, and their economic condition has
improved since the introduction of equal access to
education and health care.
