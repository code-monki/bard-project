Corfinium was an unimportant backwater world along the
great Vanguard Way that juts into Atsah from
neighboring Ian Subsector. Most of the population
worked in mining and light industry, or in support of
the copious trade that came down the Main from the
Imperial Core. The world itself is mostly desert;
temperature extremes encourage the development of very
fine dust that is irritating to breathe, and hard on
machinery and electronics. Duststorms created by fast
moving winds can move enormous amounts of this
material through the air, often in units expressed in
cubic kilometers, which can bury exposed objects to
the depth of a meters in the course of a single night.
This means the worlds oceans and rivers do not have
normal basins or riverbeds, being suspended instead
upon beds of silt and sediment that causes them to
shift wildly during seasonal changes. Most settlements
are bored into solid rock, generally mesas and
inselbergs; the downport is located on the Ape Face
Mesa, a rock that looks vaguely simian when viewed
from space.
<P>
These storms provided the raison etre for a large
Imperial Army training and logistics base located in
the planets desert outback. During the Imperial Civil
War this facility was used as a forward base against
the advance of the Dzaargh Federate. A large presence
of ground and naval forces were stationed here,
lauching raids in retaliation against Federate raids
against Denebian shipping and worlds.  In 1129 the
second regiment of the 688th Lift Infantry Division,
and the independent 4108th Assualt Infantry Regiment
took over the garrison. A large stockpile of weapons
and supplies was assembled on the world in
anticipation of renewed hostilities with the Federate
as the Civil War wound down. In 1131, notification of
Virus was recieved by the local cadres, along with the
decision to Abandon the trailing portion of the Deneb
Sector. The garrison force would now become a main
line of defense, protecting refugees from Federate
raiders, and holding the rear guard as Regency forces
were withdrawn from the Deneb-Corridor interface.
<P>
In 1133, heavy fighting with Federate forces forced
the temporary halt in the evacuations of Corfinium's
population. As the number of Federate raids increased,
and as the first sightings of Vampire Ships along the
Great Rift in Corridor were confirmed, the Regency
General Staff resolved to hold the world at all costs.
Because of its critical position, the garrison was
ordered to "hold until position is relieved", an order
conveyed from the First Regent himself.  In 1139, on
the heels of the Kishkii's attack on Trin, a Vampire
Fleet struck Corfinium, and contact with the garrison
was lost.  Fearing the worst, the Regency, hard
pressed elsewhere, wrote off the world, leaving it to
a cold fate.
<P>
Unknown to the Regency, though, the Corfinium garrison
had repulsed the Vampires with heavy losses to both
sides. Realising that they were stranded, but
unwilling to abandon military discipline in the face
of overwhelming odds, the force dug in for a long
siege. Heavy damage inflictd by the Vampires had
caused the civilian administration to collapse, and
the local army took over control of the world before
suborning itself to the garrison. Renaming itself the
Corfinium Corps, the local Regency forces have fought
against Virus uninterrupted for more than sixty years.
 The Regency heard rumors in the early 1140s of the
worlds survival, but it wasn't until 1151 that RISS
contact personnel confirmed this. And it wasn't until
the late 1150s that the Regency had shipping and the
security presence in trailing Atsah to extricate its
surviving personnel. But in all cases the Corps and
its commanders refused. Citing their original orders,
they would not abandon "their" world until the Regency
could secure against future aggression, which was an
impossible request politically to make in those days.
<P>
Ever since the Corps has made its wishes known the
Regency has respected its position, and on occasion
carries out resupply of its depleted stocks of
high-tech weapons, most notably PADs and air defense
aircraft.  Technically a TED, the world is commanded
by the Corps commander, an officer of no higher than
Major General in traditional Imperial rank. The local
military is divided between a brigade sized force of
TL 12-15 weapons, either preserved, salvaged or
occasionally provided by the Regency. The bulk of its
forces are TL 7-8, including MBTs, mass driver
anti-aircraft artillery, fast hover attack craft,
jet-propelled aircraft and rocket powered spaceplanes.
<P>
The entire world is run as a military encampment.
Every member of the populace has a prescribed role in
the local defense of the world; every job and
profession is covered and regulated by the local
military command and its regulations. Living quarters
are assigned, and travel outside of movement necessary
for duties is heavily controlled. Despite the high law
level, every adult member of the population must carry
a weapon in public at all times, and each home must be
equipped and barricaded for eventual hostilities.
Private transport is prohibited, and curfews are
enforced by military police.  Despite the paranoia of
this world, the population has access to universal
medical care, subsidised education and a number of
other luxuries undreamt of on most Wildside worlds.
<P>
In addition to normal subjects, children are given
mandatory instruction in weapons, tactics, military
discipline and even survival by school instructors.
Children as young as fourteen are inducted into local
military lagers for basic training, and the best and
most talented are elevated out into advanced technical
schools that teach them engineering, medicine and
advanced high tech armaments. On very rare occasions a
highly promising recruit is Passed to the Regency for
training in safeside military schools. Upon reaching
their majority, the local cadets are divided by their
aptitude into their different specialties, with the
smartest being commissioned as officers.
<P>
The local Vargr population is a remnant of both heavy
Dzaargh Federate raids, and of refugee flows during
the Collapse. Despite the previous period of
nationalist and racial hatred, the two groups are
fully integrated and are equal partners in the defense
of their world. One Vargr officer, Goeggzorrgh "the
Hellhound", even rose to Major General during the
period of 1177-1188. Official Regency opinion on this
world is divided. The extreme conditions that this
world and its culture developed under are not wholly
suitable for reintegration into mainstream society,
and the local officer corps contains hardliners who
resist that possibility. The current Major General,
Horash "Packula" Packard is a self described extremist
who seems to be somewhat unstable, especially in
regards to reunification with the Regency.
