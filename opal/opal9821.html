The Grudovo Pendant is a j-1 cluster of 13 worlds that
connects Tobia/Trojan Reach with neighboring
Usher/Reft. Originally a cluster of little economic
presence or importance, its economic value has risen
in proportion with the rising volume of trade that
passes between Lintl and Tobia.<P>

Kedus is home to several persisting plant species that
take advantage of offworld plants grown locally as row
crops. Several attempts at placing agro colonies here
failed as a result, and the population dwindled to
small, scattered communities of stubborn family
farmers. The increase in trade between Trojan Reach
and Deneb has been a godsend economically, as traffic
piles up in the crowded downport. The families have
banded together, ruling the world by their monopoly on
local land, and forcing immigrants to live in the
vicinity of the downport. The current starport is too
small and crowded to handle all of the traffic it
recieves, but the planetary government seems happy to
rack up high port fees rather than construct an
expansion.
