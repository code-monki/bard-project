  This civil service bureaucracy government  managed to survive the collapse unusually
well . The world population has actually more than doubled in the last 75 years , and its
tech level has grown to within one step of its pre-Collapse level. Its has a working
starport and a small starfleet , including an armed far trader and an armed scout /courier.
Its government characteristics are :
<P>
   Corruption: Low
   Talent: Moderate
   Cruelty: Moderate
   Aggression: Moderate
   Paranoia/Xenophobia: Low
 <P>
     The Teldoran government viewed  <a href="opal2050.html">Oriflamme`s</A> invasion and conquest of Spencer with considerable alarm, and now sees Oriflamme as the principal threat to its security.
Its has been smuggling arms and other supplies to guerrillas on Spencer to keep  the
resistance going  and keep Oriflamme tied down there. At the same time , it has opened
secret talks with Aubaine, and is considering applying for voluntary admission to the
Coalition  as a mean to short-circuiting  Oriflammen aggression.
<P>

                                                                    From <cite>Path of Tears</cite>  p141
</UL>


<P>
    In the last 2 years things have change quite for  Teldora . After considerable give and take  negotiations  the planet as been admitted into the Coalition . Because of the world`s  involvement on Spencer, Oriflamme  was initially  opposed to granting membership. It is also widely believe this initial  reluctance had actually more do with
the potential 23 votes (total world population at last census was 236.3 million) the
world would bring to the Federalist bloc than anything else.
<P>
  The deal involved a number of compromises from several quarters. The main
compromise was the simultaneous granting of membership to <a href="opal2070.html">Nex</A>, a potentially
Centrist world and recognition of its government as a feudal technocracy . For its
part, Teldora agreed  to suspend arms shipment to the Spencer resistance and to mediate
both a cease-fire and establishment  of a local provisional  planetary government . With tension mounting on Oriflamme the  technarchs were only too happy to  bring their troops home. Teldora also had to give a little to the Federalist and agreed to slacken its rather restrictive  legal system. Current law level is down to 10  and a number of proposals are under study which might lower it even further ( to 9 or even 8). Among the most controversial of these is the proposal allowing  private firearm ownership.

<P>


    Currently the only weapons available to civilian for hunting and recreation purposes
are compound bows and crossbows. Not even the police carries firearm , they are outfitted with tranq spray  dispensers and batons , if need be they do have access to a small arms locker at the police stations but again most of those are for use with non-lethal rounds .Anything requiring more firepower is left to the regular military or local militia units .
<P>
   An other proposition under review pertain  to the current mandatory 2 year military service for every citizens. Under the propose system , everyone would still be obligated to serve but would have the option of either a 2 year full time tour or  six month of  full time  training and  4 years in the reserve .
<P>
   Membership has also had some relatively  immediate benefit to the worlds. The government  was able to purchase the necessary  maintenance equipment it needed to
be able to reclassified the local starport to its pre-collapse rating of C . Its was also
able to bring in the machine-tools and  technical advisors needed to give local industry   the final little boost  to get  back to tl-10 . They would have figured it out on they own, they already had TL-10 capability in some fields  but would have needed a few more years in others.
<P>
 At the moment the main concern is to bring in trade from other member worlds. The
reclassification of the starport to C helps but  more is needed.  A reconditioned
<i>Bastien</i> class subsidized liner as been purchase to make a regular run to Aubaine
 via Shenandoah and Lucifer and  occasionally from Aubaine   on to Trybec or
<a href="opal1050.html">Aurora</A>. An other ship is under option for a run to <a href="opal1010.html">Eos</A> and Aurora via Oriflamme.
