Aksofouta was one of two Vargr worlds annexed by the
Regency in the early days of the Collapse to buttress
the coreward border of Deneb against Virus. The world
is mostly covered in hot desert, with most of the
population located in coastal zones in cramped
city-states. The outback is largely unclaimed by any
faction, and RQS and MoI Ranger patrols maintain
monitoring stations to prevent smugglers and corsairs
from building bases here. The locals are quite
insular, and most are devout followers of a heretical
wing of the Church of Stellar Divinity, one that
espouses a non-materialistic way of life. Advanced
technology is shunned by believers, and few will deal
directly with offworlders. Nonviolence is also
espoused, and offworld visitors will be left largely
to their own devices, to wander freely but unguided on
this strange backwater world.
