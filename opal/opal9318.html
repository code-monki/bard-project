Iptete is mostly desert, and posesses few resources.
It's only advantage lay in its prime location along
the main Urnian-Piah trade route between Shortcut and
Ronsk.  A small port was constructed in the 300s to
service this trade, but for the most part the world
attracted only a few transients.
<P>
These transient colonies, however, slowly grew in
size. Several communities of maverick pioneers
colonised the world, each representing a different
collective of free traders that used the world as
their home base. Unable to attract much trade beyond
the transient commerce flowing through the port, and
not really needing much high tech other than to
support the trade fleets, the world's TL regressed
down to a sustainable level of 3.
<P>
Several new groups branched off from the main cluster
of settlements, and journeyed into the outback, and
were soon sustaining themselves through the production
of ornate artwork, and the trade of enigmatic
artifacts transported from the most remote desert
towns.  These generally take the form of ornate
jewelry, and sometimes of more prosaic things like
eating implements and serving trays, ceramic pottery,
and ornate weaponry like knives and swords. All of
them are well made, with intricate designs in a
logical, coherent style. Some travellers have also
reported strange machinery and unusual toys in the
possession of the deep desert dwellers. And orbital
surveys have noticed the ease with which these people
seem to extract water in these parched regions.
<P>
The source for these articles have always been a
source for controversy, with the natives asserting
that they are of local manufacture, in spite of
evidence that these artifacts were manufactured at a
tech level much higher than they could accomplish at
any point of their history. And the design and
function of these artifacts are too baroque to be of
human origin.  And the natives have done much to
encourage this suspicion: they refuse to show offworld
visitors either the manufactories, or the process of
making these artifacts. All of these indicate that the
Iptetans have access to some kind of relic alien
technology and artifacts of unknown origin and
heritage. Yet the locals stubbornly insist that they
do not posess any such material.
<P>
All of this secretiveness may be calculated. It
attracts would be buyers to their out-of-the-way
world, while preventing offworld speculators from
undercutting their monopoly.  Unfortunately, it has
also attracted a good deal of scrutiny from some of
the more piratical elements of the Avalar Consulates
bureaucratic and corporate bodies.  Avalaran
companies, assisted by the Avalaran Navy, control most
of the offworld distribution and marketing of Iptetan
artifacts, and have been pressuring the locals to make
more concessions.
<P>
For centuries the Iptetans have refused, and have
sought alternative means of shipping their artifacts
offworld.  The Consulate and its agents have
retaliated through economic pressure, and veiled
military threats. Since the Collapse, it has tried to
cow recalcitrant worlds by declaring that they shelter
previously undiscovered Ancient sites, and that these
fall, by the provisions of a treaty signed with the
Zhodani in 889, under their jurisdiction.  And
naturally, Iptete has been declared an Ancient site,
even though no clear evidence exists of one, or if
these artifacts are even of that origin.
<P>
Because of the unrelenting pressure, those communities
closest to the starport have acquiesced, and have
become Avalaran clients.  A unified caretaker
government is now based at the starport to administer
the system, and to open up access to Avalaran
merchants. Avalaran naval and quarantine vessels
maintain a permanent vigil over the system, harassing
merchant ships that have actual business in the
system. Despite this heavy presence, the Consulate has
so far failed to place the majority of the population
under its control, thanks mostly to its reluctance to
create any kind of permanent garrison within deep
desert, a result of their overreliance upon offworld
supply chains and an inability to adapt to local
conditions.
