<h3>Geology</h3>
Garoo is an airless world located near the
end of the Spinward Main, at the interface with
Foreven.  The world is unusual in having a molten
core, and significant amounts of water in subsurface
aquifers created by ancient volcanism.  While Garoo
lacks tectonic plates, the world possesses massive
shield volcanoes of the same type as Olympus Mons on
Mars. These volcanoes tower some 30-40 km in height,
and have a base nearly ten times that in diameter.
Heavy metal ores are mixed in with ancient lava flows,
especially large amounts of manganese, chromium and
platinum group metals. While not as active in the
past, these volcanoes still spew small amounts of gas
and steam, and hot springs can be found in the ancient
calderas of most of them.
<P>
Garoo is an outer system world, and is a frigid -146
degrees celsius.  The world surface is covered in a
mixture of frozen rock, ice, and volcanic pumice and
gas.  Near geothermal heat sources, the ground texture
changes markedly, creating huge lens shaped
depressions created by the melting of the permafrost
under the surface rock.  These depressions are quite
large, and many of the world's settlements are built
within these huge ice lenses, constructed into the
sides with a containment dome constructed overhead.
<P>
<h3>History</h3>
Garoo was settled by Solomani colonists in
-1508, part of the same wave of refugees that included
the Itzin colonists in nearby Sacnoth. These colonists
built sturdy domed cities, and tapped the core water
for life support and power purposes. Because of the
ample sources of water and geothermal heat, the
Garooians were little disposed towards maintaining
their original technological level. Being isolated on
a world that provided with everything they needed
allowed them to scrap their colony ship, and subsist
at a tech level of 7-8.
<P>
Garoo was contacted by Darrian exploration ships
around -1370, but expressed no interest in joining the
growing Confederation. This did not deter the Darrians
from trying various strategies to coerce or persuade
them. Repeated meddling eventually escalated into
several violent confrontations and Darrian
interdiction of the system. The Garooians have never
forgotten these aggressions, and bitter enmity with
the Darrians has existed ever since.  The world was
slightly affected by the Maghiz event, though it was
more beneficial than harmful because it ended the
Darrian blockade of the system.
<P>
Garoo recieved Zhodani contact in -334, was
recontacted by the Darrians in -208, and was contacted
by the Third Imperium in 255.  This steady
accumulation of expansionistic powers unsettled them,
especially the growing linkage between the Imperials
and the Darrians. The world government pursued a
policy of neutrality, playing various factions against
each other through adroit diplomatic maneuvering.  A
trade fleet was acquired, and trade and diplomatic
ties were established with a number of polities in
neighboring Foreven and Beyond.
<P>
Garoo was aided by the enmity between the Zhodani and
the expanding Third Imperium. They played the two
sides off against one another, milking whichever ally
they had for the moment for their own gain, and all
the while remaining quietly neutral in the conflict.
After the Third Frontier War, the Garooians mostly
sided with the Zhodani, and intensifying their
conflict with the Darrians.
<P>
Despite the occasional gust of war, Garoo managed to
continue building up its economic and military power.
As the Darrians began to return, with Imperial aid, to
the level of their pre-Maghiz society, Garoo's
nominally peaceful government percieved the loss of
their independence. They unified their government
under a military council, and began to act proactively
against the Confederacy. In the last few years before
the Imperial Civil War, the Garoo military seized
neighboring 886-945, which had one of the few gas
giant in rimward Daryen subsector, and resubjugated
<a href="9525.html">Uniqua</A>, a world colonised and inhabited by Garooians.
With these conquests, and Zhodani blessing, it seemed
that they were intent upon creating their own
interstellar polity aimed at challenging the Darrians
and the Imperium for control of the Daryen/Five
Sisters/Reidain/Urnian interface.
<P>
And then came the Collapse.  The people of Uniqua
managed to stage a revolt with massive Darrian aid,
leading to the partial ouster of the Garoo occupation
force. The Uniqua conflict led to a protracted
military conflict with the Confederacy at Kardin (SM
0429) and <a href="9523.html">Bularia</A> (0430), which ended only when the
Regency threatened to bury both sides under an
avalanche of naval firepower. Recognising the worlds
insecurity and humilation after the implosion of their
republic, the Regency offered to make Garoo a
protectorate, placing them under the RQS security
blanket and giving its exports preferential clearance.
Garoo reluctantly accepted becoming a client state by
a closely contested referendum in 1137. A Regency
naval base was built insystem, and gave the world a
much needed kickstart for its economy. The world
remains on high alert against further Darrian
aggression on Uniqua and in other parts of Daryen and
Reidain subsectors, though relations with the Regency
have warmed up since they took over.
<P>
Geographical: Most of Garoos settlements are found
close to water and geothermal sources.  Most of the
older cities are domed lens cities, while the newer
ones are underground arcologies.  Four volcanic
clusters dominate the world, and near these are the
four main clusters of settlements.
<P>
These clusters include the:<P>

<LI>1. Salka Cluster: which includes the capitol and main
downport.
<P>
<LI>2. Corben Hotdome: Most volcanically active region on
the planet, and the most lightly populated.
<P>
<LI>3. Ataturk Massif: Richest mineral resources, and the
majority of the worlds manufacturing are located here,
including several large munitions works.
<P>
<LI>4. Gyduran Geysers: Large underground geothermal
aquifer. The name is an exaggeration, and simply
refers to the very high steam and water pressure that
is found within the aquifer.  Famous throughout the
Spin Extents for its hot mineral baths and tourist
spas.  Also famous for its unusual but delicious beers
made from certain mineral laden waters.
<P>
<h3>Cultural</h3>
Garooians are descended from straight
Solomani stock.  As such they profess the same love of
political freedom as their SolCon cousins. Their
adopted worlds harsh environment forced them to adapt
their culture in many significant ways, however. As a
group individualism is tolerated to a point. Children
are indulged as regards their education.  Free speech
and conscience are encouraged.  But Garooians
recognise that too much of these freedoms are
counterproductive to their survival.  While all of the
usual Solomani institutions are in evidence, a strong
backbone of tradition exist throughout the entire
fabric of their society, ensuring communal
cooperation.<P>

Much of this cooperativeness is a byproduct of their
past struggles with the Darrians. Squabbling between
colonies nearly resulted in the capture or surrender
to their enemies.  Garooians love to argue and contest
each other in sports and politics.  But on issues of
survival paramount to the entire world, they move with
a ruthless unity that would shock even Vilani.
<P>
Wealth and luxury are the pinnacle of local society.
While consensus exists that the community comes first
at a certain point, local society isn't monolithic,
and gaps of wealth and power exist to differentiate
the local society into an exacting pecking order of
money and power.  This isn't selfish wealth, as all
local companies and enterprises are owned in
collective by the world government.  For a person to
succeed to a lofty position requires singleminded
devotion and willingness to sacrifice for the
community, on the battlefield of commercial success.
Of course those most successful in their service are
handsomely rewarded by the planetary government.
<P>
The ultimate sign of success is to qualify for Garoo's
Register, sort of a planetary Who's Who. Those that
qualify are afforded more than the usual cramped
quarters available to the vast majority of the locals;
they recieve huge airy vaults filled with living
plants, running water, and freestanding buildings.
These individuals are also virtually guaranteed
political legitimacy, and a seat upon one of the
various political councils, or a managerial position
in a major bureaucracy. Of course, these luxuries and
privileges are provided in kind, for their continuing
contributions.  People who slack off are demoted from
the Register, and are sent back into the masses.
Needless to say, it creates no small amount of
intrigue among the "upper" classes.
<P>
Interestingly, while most Garooians profess a belief
in the individual freedom of their children, arrange
for their children's marriages years in advance.
Mostly this is due to a desire for upper mobility,
with families searching for the best possible
candiadates from the best potential families and
backgrounds to marry their progeny.
 <P>
<h3>Political</h3>
Garoo has traditionally been a
represenative democracy, with representation based
within its upper classes.  The continuing standoff
with the Darrians has preserved the longstanding war
council, which really isn't much of departure from the
old system when seen up close.  The Council, otherwise
known as the War Register, consists of three dozen of
the wealthiest and most powerful people on the planet.
 All of these people have made considerable
contributions through the public cartels, the military
or in the intelligence services, and have an absolute
say over the planet and their fellow citizens based
upon the War Charter of 1119 that enshrined and
legitimised the current Register.
 <P>
One lingering bad effect has been the steady loss of
democratic tradition.  Previously, people acceded to
the Register, and then chosen again for political
office, based upon election by fellow citizens within
"wards" divided amongst the varous communities.
Nowadays, election is by consensus among the other
members of the Register, which is creating a social
rift between the classes that continues to widen. Many
of the worlds traditionalists suspect that the War
Register is simply using the supposed conflict with
the Darrians and the conflict on Uniqua to
institutionalise their position without competition,
and eliminate democratic rule alltogether.

System Notes: Hazmat is currently used as a dumping
ground for the systems garbage.
 <P>
Spangle is a special containment facility constructed
to support the local world military. Several now
disused military labs and test ranges dot the surface
of the world.  It has been rumored to also be a
safehouse for the local intel and security services
for rather unsavory activities.
 <P>
Rounder is a source of additional minerals that are in
short supply on Garoo, and for dangerous low-G
manufacturing that the authorities want to keep
contained away from the world environment.
 <P>
Graveyard is so named because of its strange
attraction to misjumped ships.  A large number of
vessels that have misjumped have crashed here in the
systems long history, and a community of scavengers
used to live on the world to benefit from this unusual
phenomenon.  A research station has been established
in conjunction with the Regency Navy to study this
mystery, and a naval rescue station has been set up to
intercept and rescue other victims before slamming
into the world.
 <P>
Details on Graveyard and the Garoo Republic
government come from GT Behind the Claw.
