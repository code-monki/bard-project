Pasternak is an industrial world situated at the far
spinward-coreward corner of the Avalar Consulate. It
possesses an unusually low tech level for such a
world. This is partially the result of political
conflicts with the Consulate government, but mostly to
do with its unusual astrographic position. For
Pasternak orbits the smaller dwarf companion star in
the system, rather than the primary star.
<P>
This situation is the primary reason that the world is
habitable at all.  An orbit closer, within its G0V
primary's life zone, and it would be too hot to
support life.  But while this makes the world livable,
the orbital period around the smaller star makes for
alternating seasons that go from frigid to unbearably
hot, in as little as two standard months.  During the
hot season, massive amounts of water are evaporated
from the world's small oceans and lingering glacier
ice, and differential heating creates massive thermals
that are dangerous for inexperienced pilots to fly
through. During the cold season, this moisture rains
down in massive storms, with rain quickly becoming
snow and ice that can flatten small structures.  The
ground and soil are practically useless for
agriculture under these conditions, and the ground is
heavily broken up by "flash" weathering and erosion.
<P>
The world's local lifeforms have adapted to this
pummeling cycle through very unusual adaptations.
During the hot months, the local fauna are ravenous in
their appetites, accumulating thick insulating shells
or fat layers, as temperature decline, to the point of
extreme corpulence.  They then drag themselves into
deep warrens, or dig burrows to weather the glacial
season. When the hot season begins again, they shed
these outside layers, which are quickly decomposed by
rapidly growing fungi and plant life.  Seasons on
Pasternak, then, are typified by rapid explosions of
death and florid life.  Metabolisms are paced
throughout the local life cycles, but long lived
species are a rarity.
<P>
Despite its severe weather, Pasternak was colonised
around 710-717.  The world had very rich mineral
resources, and the Consulate government was only too
happy to provide conscripted labor for the development
of the mines.  So rich were Pasternak's minerals and
ores, that it could pay for most of its food imports,
and sustain fairly comfortable living conditions for
its work force.  Most of the planets population lives
in deep underground warrens adjoining the mines, that
are little more than caverns blasted and quarried out
of the surrounding rock, with few free-standing
structures of any kind. Some of these cities are huge
affairs kms in depth, and the population has become
inured to the dirt, darkness, and excessive heat that
is found in the lower habitation levels.  Virtually
every factory and mine processing station is found in
the lower levels, and the stench of industry, smelting
and refining can permeate every corner to the point of
being unbearable.
<P>
For their part, the locals have adapted to the local
constraints, and are content with their lot. Time
tends to move very slowly anyway, as the locals rarely
spend that much time on the surface except for urgent
business, and the passage of seasons is irrelevant
except for the flow of ore shipments.  Other Avalaran
worlds tend to look down upon them, contemptous of
their lack of ambition and disconnection from the ebb
and flow of events within higher society and the
states' politics.  Pasternakians tend to reinforce
this stereotype with a feigned bumptiousness and a
loudly stated disdain for luxury and manners.
<P>
While the rest of the Consulate may be disgusted with
their poor show of manners and tolerance of spartan
surroundings, Pasternak has made a real success out of
its local political system. The slow progress of
technological development, the egalitarianism of the
mines and the concentration on procedural matters
related to the mines and social consensus has created
one of the strongest democratic governments in the
entire Consulate.  Well developed political parties,
strong republican traditions, a well established
bicameral legislature, and a civil service known for
its deference and competency are in strong evidence.
Naturally the style of this government and associated
local traditions epitomise everything that the greater
Consulate and the usual local authorities are not.
Conflicts with Consulate government over interference
in local politics and jurisdictional responsibilities
have been a perpetual feature of local politics, often
more important in the time they consume than most
other political priorities combined.
