This world is home to the most important of the
Regency's 13 scout way stations. The Gaza station was
the main connection between the Domain of Deneb and
the main part of the Third Imperium, responsible for
all X-Boats in the trailing subsectors of Deneb.  The
Collapse has made its mundane role of critical
importance.  All couriers and X-Web carriers serving
Quarantine District 3 and 4 are serviced at Gaza;
these are the vessels responsible for carrying first
warning of Vampire penetration. The safety and
serviceability of the local courier fleet is
paramount, and the Gaza base has the tightest security
of any way station.

Gaza is a striking sight from space, for its surface
is a gleaming white, which belies its hostility to
life. The local population was mostly connected with
the port in antebellum times, serving trade moving
into Deneb from Corridor. In recent times the economy
has shifted to support of RQS and RISS activities
along the vital frontier interface, and the world sees
heavy use by both of those services for ship
maintenance, operational support and R and R.
