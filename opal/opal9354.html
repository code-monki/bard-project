The Torinsk system is relatively empty. The system's
four gas giants have elliptical orbits that prevented
planetary formation from occuring close to the
primary. The system contains a mere five orbits, all
of them occupied by the giants, or the local asteroid
belt. The belt more than makes up for the systems lack
of other attractions. While not as extensive as
<A HREF="opal9353.html">Mahir's</A> belt, Torinsk contains a higher concentration
of nickel-iron meteorites, and is therefore more cost
efficient in terms of explotaition costs and return on
investment.
<P>
Torinsk was <A HREF="opal9351.html">Xenough's</A> first imperial possession, and a
colony was first established in 340. Interestingly,
Zhodani belters had bypassed the system for the
seemingly richer Mahir system, and Xenough's colonists
found the system relatively untouched.  The Zhodani's
minimisation of it wealth initially colored Avalaran
prejudices as well, and concentrated their military
efforts in the Xenough Wars towards <A HREF="opal9347.html">Hepring</A> and Mahir.
This disinterest permitted a less stringent local
government, and more extensive and variegated
technological and industrial development. A nascent
shipbuilding industry took hold, and eventually
eclipsed the mining industry in importance.
<P>
This relaxed scrutiny also lent a degree of impunity
for local military units. Military shipyards were
built, and constructed an increasing number of raiding
vessels that were used by the Xenough Navy against
Avalaran shipping. The growing presence of military
facilities insystem finally attracted major Avalaran
attention, and the system was captured during the last
Xenough War. The Battle of Torinsk crippled the
Xenough war effort, but inflicted so many losses upon
the  Avalars that an armistice had to be declared.  In
the peace that followed, the Torinsk Cluster was
absorbed into the Consulate, where they remain thorny
and difficult neighbors.
<P>
The Avalar government has made little headway in
assimilating the Torinsk worlds primarily because of
its heavy handed diplomatic and domestic efforts in
Torinsk itself. All of Xenough's colonies recieved
nominal independence, though in fact they acted as
loyal subordinates to their motherworld even after the
fact. Seeking to sever these ties, the Consulate's
Shanza secret police had endeavored to subvert and
undermine the new governments. Tight security (and
strict psionic regulations) on Xenough and Mahir
prevented successful operations on those worlds, and
the Syndari government of Hepring was zealously
nationalistic. Their efforts, while futile, have in
many cases further antagonised the Xenough government
and its allies to enact further anti-Avalar activities
and policies.
<P>
But Torinsk's relatively light security, and a growing
community of Avalaran immigrants, permitted the Shanza
a power base. A large Avalaran naval base was
constructed to conceal and support their efforts.
Under various economic and military pressure, and
through careful identification and elevation of
dissident elements of the local Kopol, a strongly
pre-Avalar government of one kind or another has
reigned in Torinsk.  The cost of this subversion has
been strong distrust and intercommunal violence among
local power factions, and a intermittent power
struggle that reerupts under various outside stimuli,
whether sanctioned by the Avalar government or not.
The local government, regardless of its incarnation,
has little or no support among the general population,
and are only propped up by generous subsidies from the
Shanza and the Consulate Navy.  Moreover, each
government has proven wildly ineffectual in removing
loyalty among the local castes from Xenough, and most
of the local economy and culture have gone
underground. Taxation and regulation are virtually
unenforceable, except under the gun shadow of the
regime's imported mercenaries and supporting Avalaran
Naval patrols. The current regime was established in
1145, after the overthrow of the previous pro-Xenough
government.
<P>
The local populace is deeply suspicious of outsiders,
especially anyone associated with the local Avalar
community or the government.  Armaments are forbidden
to the local population, security checkpoints are
interspersed around the system, and armed patrols
regularly sweep the systems settlements for contraband
and anti-regime propaganda. These efforts have been
futile in rooting out local nationalists, and attempts
at suppressing smuggling of exports and tax money back
to Xenough are a constant source of local humor. Most
minor indigenous officials are either quietly loyal to
Xenough, and many Avalars are on the take or look the
other way out of resignation.  Popular opinion in the
Consulate regards the national government's covert
operations on Torinsk as a waste of time and money,
but official hubris has prevented a withdrawal from
the system.
