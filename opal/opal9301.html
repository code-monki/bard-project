Benoncra is a hazy world of few resources and few
attractions.  It atmosphere and local water sources
are contaminated with the oily excema of local
microorganisms, making the air unbreathable and the
water uningestible.  The world also has an unusually
long rotational period of about four standard days,
making it uncomfortably hot and cold.
 <P>
Yet Benoncra was settled very early in the Imperial
period, and has steadily grown throughout its
existence. What she lacks in resources, she makes up
in location. For Benoncra is the spinward end of the
great Spinward Main.  Among J-1 traders the world is
simply referred to as the "Trail Head" or "Road's
End."  The world's economy revolves around this trick
in astrography: it is a "break-bulk" point for
incoming J-1 cargoes. Much of the populace is employed
in emptying J-1 traders completely of their cargoes,
and swap them for cargoes brought from other points of
Urnian and Reidain by higher jump freighters.
 <P>
As most J-1 ships are owned these days by either
subsidised contractors or vagabond independents, these
people don't have the fancy corporate accounts, or
deep logistical pockets that the bigger company
freighters have access to on worlds like Urnian,
Mainap and Danalisa.  Coupled with the longer loading
times for J-1 freighters, there has always been a
strong demand for entertainment and hospitality
services for crews waiting for their ships' holds to
be filled for the long return trip back down the Main.
And Benoncra's hostels, bars and clubs live up to
their world's moniker.
 <P>
The world's entire population lives in or near what
would be the extrality zone of an old Imperial
starport.  Everything is tied to the Main and its
vital traffic. The startown is huge and glittery even
by pre-Collapse standards. And most of the local
establishments only cater to independents.  The only
corp types that are tolerated are those crews that
frequently make the trip to Benoncra from neighboring
worlds, and even they are treated in a mock grudging
manner by the locals.
 <P>
The local government generates additional income
through memberships, administered and maintained by
the local TAS office, in the End of the Road
Fellowship. Any free trader of good reputation and
commitment to service who can be vouchsafed by a
current Fellow can join the Fellowship.  Each Fellow
pays a yearly dues equal to half of one percent of
their ships' revenue, though members have the choice
of paying even more if they feel it is in their and
their fellows' best interests. In return for this fee,
each Fellow recieves reduced charges and discounts for
lodging, entertainment and ship maintenance every time
they visit Benoncra.
 <P>
Additional benefits include the funding and
maintainment of a voluntary rescue patrol sent to aid
missing or stranded crews.  Medical services are
discounted as well, and emergency care is free.  The
Fellowship also has a pension fund, a savings bank and
maintains a several retirement homes for wayward
former free traders.
