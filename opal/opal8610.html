The capitol of Inar subsector is a cold rockball that
was first settled by the Imperial Navy in 167 in
support of colonisation of coreward Deneb. The
civilian society lives in a cluster of underground
tunnels bored out by past Naval excavation.  Private
tunneling has created a crisscrossing network around
the old downport, most of which are simply utility and
transit tunnels. These allow for private residences to
be bored out at random intervals, creating striptowns
that sprawl over hundreds of kilometers. To facilitate
the shipment of supplies, many property and business
owners have constructed their own private landing
berths on the surface, connected to their vaults by
conveyors or lift shafts.
<P>
The inhabitants are affiliated with private groups,
institutions and companies that exploited the world's
cheap real estate and strategic location. Few
population clusters above 100,000 people exist, and
public culture is nearly nonexistent.  The original
world government was a private corporation, hired to
fill the gap for public services. This has given rise
to an oligarchic council, known as the Inar
Commission, consisting of officials elected from among
the managers and trustees of local organisations.
<P>
Inar's most prominent landmark is the huge Destiny
Highport, a space station shaped like a massive
maltese cross that is a familiar sight to generations
of spacers in Deneb. Destiny's arms span six
kilometers from end to end, and used to accomodate
hundreds of ships a day. The facility has its own
government, and the populated portion was considered
to be an Imperial member state in its own right.
After the Civil War and Collapse a partial abandonment
of the port occured as ship traffic slowed and
security could no longer be ensured in the face of
Vargr and Virus aggression. Regency corps took over
the empty sections, and and turned them into a major
shipbuilding center. The recent opening of the
Frontier has renewed interest in the facility, and
thousands of traders and filibusters have made Destiny
a transit base in anticipation of the riches to gained
from the Wilds.
