Lune recieved its name from its close resemblence to
Earth's moon. The world is a waterless ball of
anorthositic rock of the same composition and color as
Luna, and it is also a moon in orbit around a much
larger (size A) world, the world of Mala Tierre (UPP:
FAB4562-A Mi).  The resemblance doesn't end there
either, as it seems to possess the same geological
history.
 <P>
Both Luna and Lune were created by a huge planetismal
collision with their parent worlds. In Terra's case, a
huge world fragment the size of Mars was slammed into
Earth, possibly through the influence of an errant
Jupiter. The collision ejected a plume of lighter
non-volatile elements into near-Earth orbit, and it
eventually clumped to form its moon.
 <P>
Lune shows the same geological features as Luna,
including tidal lock, mares (seas) of basaltic lava on
the bright side facing Mala Tierre, and an asymetrical
crust. The body that created Lune must have been
titanic, but no trace has even been found of this
errant body.
 <P>
Where Lune is different is that it has an atmosphere,
and a slight amount of water.  Despite severe heating
and cooling during its 263 hour day, it was habitable
enough to attract prospectors intent upon exploiting
Mala Tierre's rich mineral deposits.
 <P>
First settled around 280, the world was primarily a
transhippment point for either heavy elements from
Mala Tierre, or for the lighter elements, particularly
Titanium and Vanadium ores, from Lune proper.  Cities
arose from the camps on the near face, while smaller
outback communities dotted the "darkside" or farside.
The harshness of life made the locals harsh and
greatly resilient. Deep divisions arose between the
worlds scattered cities over a multitude of issues,
particularly water, and the bitterness of these
conflicts made voluntary cooperation in government all
but impossible.
 <P>
The first dictatorship took over the world in 433,
having its origin in several mining camp militias, and
succeeded in coercing the other metropolitan areas
into its control. This dictatorship was unstable, and
was overthrown by the First Frontier War, but it was
succeeded by a long line of similar rickety
governments that attempted to control the world and
its surly population.
 <P>
In the late 1110s the charismatic dictatorship of
"Marshal" Bela Meguna was deposed by a coup led by
several rebel factions, and the world disintegrated
into an especially bloody civil war. The war was still
raging by the time of the Collapse, though its
intensity had lessened greatly as a result of
increasing civil hardship, and civil strife on Urnian
that disrupted the flow of weaponry.
 <P>
Citing "a clear and present danger to the Avalar
Consulate and the Quarantine" Consulate forces invaded
the world in late 1132. They quickly established bases
on the farside, and used a mixed strategy of
commercial interdiction (siege) and quick assualts of
ground troops against vital life support facilities to
coerce the local factions into surrendering.  By 1135,
the Consulate declared the world free of hostilities,
and reopened it to outside contact.
 <P>
The Avalar occupation is highly unpopular with the
locals.  The Consulate is seen as an oppurtunistic
meddler rather than the world's savior, a mood
reinforced by its heavyhanded policies and strict
control over mining production and exports.  This
resistance is mooted by the simmering resentments
between the world's local factions, and a lack of
consensus on the appropriate action or the unified
front to be taken against their occupiers. In the end,
the Consulate is tolerated because it is the only
force for order and unity on this bitterly divided
world.  No matter how bad the occupation is, the
alternative is much worse.
 <P>
The world's Amber Zone is a reflection of this
internal animosity, as terrorist attacks and civil
disruptions against neighboring communities are a
daily occurence. Attacks on the Avalaran occupation
troops are rare (but are massive and deadly when they
do occur) but attacks against collapborators are quite
common.  The bombings and assassinations are rarely
intended to directly target offworlders, but the
chance of collateral damage is too great to simply
ignore.
 <P>
People arriving and leaving insystem are often
detained for days as their belongings are searched and
backgrounds examined.  This is partially to satisfy
Quarantine requirements, but mostly to deter the
offworld flow of armaments and explosives.  Most
analysts think that this draconian customs are now
rather counterproductive, as the locals have enough
local sources for arms manufacture as to make it moot.
