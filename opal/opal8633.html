Kemal is a very rich world, thanks to its prodigious
output of agricultural products that it exports to
Askigaak. The higher surface temperatures and local
soils are very suitable for fast growing crop strains,
and in the course of a normal year local farmers can
produce three or four crops.  Since it is the only
world in Star Lane with a sizeable food surplus,
Askigaak is heavily dependent upon it to supplement
and ameliorate the mostly fungal or vatgrown food its
citizens subsist upon. Naturally local farmers charge
premium prices via long-term contracts that locks
Askigaak into an oligopolistic pattern.
<P>
The money that Kemal earns is well invested, and the
local standard of living is higher than the low listed
tech level would otherwise imply. Because of
Askigaak's dominance in their economy, Kemalians spend
most of their leisure time immersed in that world's
arcane politics, and actually makes some attempt to
influence events on that world. In the past the locals
have done some outrageous things, and they usually
appear even to their neighbors to be hicks who are
aspiring to a level way above their proper station.
Nonetheless Kemal's Solomani population understands
Askigaak's insular Vilani culture better than any
other world in the subsector, and often helps smooth
over ruffled feathers. In recent years the population
has come under the influence of the Shui-he movement
on nearby Shen-Yang (Deneb 0727) and the local culture
is begining to alter in a fundamental way.
