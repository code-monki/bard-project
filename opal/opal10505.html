A way station, unlike the old Imperial equivalent, is
a base that facilitates fleet communications, by
assisting naval couriers, and doesn't actually have
any repair or basing capabilities for line fleet
units. A Zhodani Depot is the same as the Imperial
Depot.<P>

<B>Anika Subsector:</B>
<P>

Based upon the subsector writeup done by James Kundert
a.k.a. GypsyComet (except for the Tlebria (1618)
system which is taken from Berka's main page, and the
new primary star listing for Zdovesil.)
<P>
Anika Subsector, as with all Zhodani subsectors along
its rim-trailing corner, is classified as an Amber
Zone, the result of the Zhodani Exodus. Worlds that
have a specific Amber rating either have a pre-1202
rating, or to call attention to local conditions of
concern to travellers.
<P>
Anika is a remote frontier subsector of minor
importance. Formerly, Anika had no high population
worlds, and the subsector was dominated by small
frontier agricultural worlds. The non-aligned worlds
of the subsector were too minor and isolated for
strong trade ties to the Imperium or some other power,
and thus were of little threat to Zhodani control of
the subsector. This dominance allowed the Zhodani
military to construct an extensive infrastructure of
supply and training facilities to support its fleets
along the Imperial border, with little fear of attack
or interference. Most significant of these facilities
was the naval depot at Oriaj A' (1312), which
supported fleets in neighboring Spinward Marches.
<P>
Anika is defended by the Zhodani 10th Fleet from its
base on Zdovesil (1212). The 10th has a long history
of military action against the former Third Imperium
and its allies, and participated in all five frontier
wars. This long and distinguished service created an
elite reputation for the 10th, and made it a
stronghold for strong anti-Imperial sentiment.  During
the Fifth Frontier War, the 10th accompanied the 40th
Fleet during the last push to Rhylanor, and nearly
suffered the same fate, losing about eighty percent of
its original units in fighting around Rhylanor and
Zivijie. The brutality of the fighting, and the
destruction of so many of its elite units embittered
the survivors, and this bitterness extends to the
present day.  The 10th's personnel harbor strong
antipathy against Non-Zhodani, and barely concealed
hatred against the Regency and the Avalar Consulate;
the former because of Rhylanor and Norris's legacy,
the latter for the ugly break that occured in the
1150s.
<P>
The Post-Collapse period saw a slight increase in
trade with the non-aligned worlds of the subsector,
and a small improvement in tech level. But the
subsector was never a high priority for development,
and a small population 8 world like Zdovesil could
easily control the surrounding space with little
trouble. The Exodus and Civil War has impacted
Consulate control of the subsector. Zdovesil was
placed under martial law in the late 1190s following a
breakdown in civil order, and the subsector is now
dominated by the growing worlds of Ebriapl (1112),
Belt Maginium (1218) and Tlebria (1618). All three
worlds have begun to assert their commercial power,
and have escalated their self-defense initiatives in
the wake of the 10th Fleets increasingly terroristic
course.
<P>
The worlds of Ile Danse (1416) and Belt Maginium were
once percieved by the Zhodani as a threat to dominance
of the subsector. This fear subsided in the
Post-Collapse period, and Belt Maginium was induced to
become a Zhodani client state. The distrust cultivated
between the two worlds by the Zhodani has only faintly
subsided, and the Exodus has reawakened old
animosities. Ile Danse is the only independent A class
starport along the Zhodani border, and security has
been tightened in the wake of threats by the Zhodani
10th Fleet.<P>

Hamagast (1319) is home to the H'Mag, a minor race
vaguely reminiscent of Terra's Secretary Bird (a
long-legged African raptor) known for their
"enthusiastic" Police and Customs Officers, who take
great pleasure in making up rules and enforcing them
with truncheon or bribe (or both, if the bribe isn't
large enough). This and other "charming" racial traits
have conspired against any technological rise being
made available to the H'Mag by the Belt Maginites OR
the Zhodani. (Hamagast and H'Mag descriptions were
written by James Kundert, and were taken verbatim from
Zhodani Base and Gypsy Comets page. This description
is pretty evocative.)
<P>
Tlebria (1618): There is one difference in this
version of Anika SS compared to the version at
GypsyComets site. The planet called Tare (1618) was
renamed to Tlebria as indicated in <Cite>Book 7: Merchant
Prince</cite>. Tlebria is the homeport of Iadria Vlovl, a
Zhodani Sector-Wide
Merchant Company that provides transport between major
Zhodani worlds and has extended this service to high
population non-Zhodani Worlds in the sector. The
company specialises in cargo (rather than passenger)
transport. Iadria Vlovl enjoys a Zhodani military
subsidy, and its ships are armed. Iadria Vlovl has
chosen not to have its homeport in Zhodani Space for
the same  reasons that many of Earth's shipping
companies are located in Panama or Liberia. Tlebria is
also conveniently located on the trade route between
the Avalar Consulate and the Zhodani Consulate.
(Above was written by Per-Olof "Berka" Bergstedt and
is taken verbatim from Zhodani Base.)
<P>
(TNE has seen Tlebria become a major connector world
for Zhodani refugees en route to the Avalar Consulate,
and the population of the world has swelled
considerably, mostly with people reluctant to remain
within the Consulate, but fearful of settling on a
Non-Zhodani world. Iadria Vlovl was one of the few
vestiges of Zhodani power that the Avalars would deal
with directly after the diplomatic break of the 1150s.
The company has had some difficulty in handling the
continous inflow of people, and has hired a number of
Non-Zhodani starmerc organisations from Reidain
Subsector to help with relief operations.)
<P>
1116 Population was 3.0 Billion, and it was evenly
divided between the Zhodani and non-aligned regions of
the subsector.  While the Zhodani Exodus hasn't
impacted Anika as severly as subsectors adjacent to
the Regency, and most refugees that travel through
here show more favor for the nearby Avalar Consulate,
the 1202 population is 8.3 Billion, a significant
increase nevertheless.  The highest tech level is E,
at Shrdrplibrie (1016) and Dashiietl (1216).
