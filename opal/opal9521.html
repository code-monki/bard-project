Formerly known as 769-422. This world is a mystery.
When the IISS contacted this world in 49, it found a
native human population of indeterminate origin.
Genetic surveys of the population were infuriatingly
inconclusive, which meant it could have been an
Ancient remnant similiar to the Darrians, or a really
obscure Solomani colony that had been lost and had
transformed radically, or even the colony of some
other Ancient transported human race.  None of these
hypotheses are confirmed or denied by local evidence,
though no Ancient remanants, or trace of Solomani
culture or language has ever been found.
 <P>
Whatever their origins, the local humans (who call
themselves the Trexen) could not have been voluntarily
planted on this world. The local vegetation is mostly
inedible, and the soils are poorly developed for
agriculture anyway. To subsist, they herd huge 30
metric ton herbivores called Stsarcs, and move
nomadically across the worlds extensive prairies in
search of fodder. Most of their clothing, building
material and food come from these animals. Stsarc
tusks were a form of currency, and the bones were even
used for art and musical instruments. When contacted
the Trexen were mostly at TL 3, but showed
considerable mechanical acumen.
 <P>
The Trexen are a peaceful and unaggressive group.
Unlike most nomadic humans, disputes were resolved by
careful negotiation and sharing of grazing lands.
Family groups are loosely held together, and
individuals and small families frequently switched
their allegiances, joining with other clans whenever
they met. This cooperative unity was butressed by
strong traditions of shrewd intertribal governance,
and an efficient method of interclan communication
that kept the wandering bands in close contact, even
when thousands of kms away.  And they had a
sophisticated grasp of economics that let them hold
their own against offworld merchants. All of this
activity seems to stem from the severe dry spells that
the world undergoes at frequent intervals; conflict
over land and water made scarce by drought would have
decimated these people.
 <P>
Because the Trexen were both heavily dependent upon
their stsarcs for survival, and showed no fear or
xenophobia towards the IISS contact team, the
unprecedented step of aiding their development was
undertaken.  Many Trexen were educated in basic TL 5
industrial skills, and were given small amounts of
machinery to construct whatever they need or desired.
They proceeded to create several small factories
scattered across the planet, and created additional
income through the manufacture and offworld trade of
select TL 5-8 materials.  But they did not abandon
their stsarc herds or their nomadic patterns despite
their relatively quick advancement into the internal
combustion age.  And few of them showed any desire or
inclination to leave the world for "better" prospects.
 <P>
It was this bucolic contentment that attracted the
eyes of the Regency when it sought to better control
its distant rimward border.  Following the successful
integration of NEO ecologists on <A href="opal9515.html">Prince Edward</A>, it
tried to replicate that success on 769-422. Unlike PE,
the ecologists planted were less successful at
integration.  While many accepted the pastoral
lifestyle, most of these colonists had greater
expectations of their lives than wading through the
dung piles created by a dimwitted, two story tall
plant eater.  Fortunately, most found a niche in
nestled "pod-towns" scattered around the world, near
the Trexen factories, that act as clan meeting points
and trade centers for the nomads.  Relations between
the two groups are fairly amicable, though most of the
colonists children are pretty bored by the life and
opt to leave offworld as soon as they reach their
majority.
