The second most heavily populated world in the Regency
is also one of the most dangerous. Beaxon is the
seventh moon of the gas giant Vandergun, and flexing
and heating by its gravitational and magnetic fields
cause the world to undergo seasonal changes in the
shape and level of its geode. Beaxon also possesses a
highly elliptical orbit around its mother, and it
proximity to it, and periodic swings close to its
sister moon L'Epiphanie that create seasonal
variations in weather and water currents. All of this
creates dramatic changes to the worlds land and water
surfaces.
<P>
The world ocean is subject to strong ocean currents,
most dramatically in the form of high speed (300 mph+)
cells of water known as Hellbores, which are created
by a combination of thermal and tectonic processes.
The unpredictableness, and destructive fury, of this
phenomenon is what gives the world its amber zone
rating. About every thiry local years or so these
currents can combine to create a superstorm of water
and air currents referred to as a Devil's Churn of
destructive power unmatched by any other known
terrestrial meteorlogical process. Strangely enough it
was this massive thermal energy that attracted
colonists to settle the world, who tapped it with OTEC
(Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion) plants to provide
power for the world's massive mines and refineries.
<P>
The world's cities are mostly deepwater or floating
arcologies constructed in the world's horse latitudes
or abyssal plains. Currents stagnate or equalise in
these regions, permitting construction without fear of
tectonic or seismic catastrophe. Most abyssal plains
are covered in the metallic nodules that are essential
to the local economy anyway, and most settlements are
outgrowths of mineral extraction dredge sites. In some
areas of the abyssal plains settling of dissolved
silica has created vast chert platforms, and
underwater mountains and canyons, that form a solid
foundation for large scale arcologies and
megastructures. Beaxon's cities are built on a massive
scale reminiscent of Vincennes or Askigaak, but cover
a much larger area, literally ringing the planet along
the tropic lines, and suffer from less crowding.
Architecture is more inspired by Vincennes, and
underwater communities have large void spaces for
common areas and public gathering, or at least
creating the illusion of open air. Underwater transit
lines connect the communities, which are continous
except where currents or hellbores crosscut the line
of settlement.
<P>
Combined with ample local mineral resources, Beaxon
has long been a manufacturing powerhouse. Its
strategic location along the Rift Highway ensured
access to both Imperial and Aslan markets, a good
example of a "rimland" astrography. Local industry has
always been well developed, with a good mixture of
primary extraction firms mixed in with growing high
tech industries. Since the closing of the Regency's
markets following the collapse, high prices for mined
ores has directly benefitted the local economy,
permitting heavy investment in several new industries
and markets. Most of this money was spent on food
imports in the past, though improving technology and
recently constructed undersea and orbital arbories
have made the world more self sufficient in the last
forty years or so.
<P>
The local population is an eclectic mix of immigrants.
The idealistic secularists of Tobia/Tobia, and the
religious communities of nearby Lintl/Vestus were the
largest sources of colonists over the world's 800 year
history, and the miscegenation has created a vibrant
culture that mixes a moderate form of the Totality
religion with an emphasis on a philosophy of outward
civic responsibility. More recently the world recieved
refugees displaced by Aslan advances in Trojan Reach,
and about a billion refugees from Trin in the wake of
the Rape. Despite this variety, the world's history of
mostly seamless assimilation has created a peaceful
culture that is one of the most progressive in the
Regency today. Long standing tensions left over from
the Imperial era or the Civil War period, between
various member groups or races, or between humans and
Aslan, are noticeably absent here, making the world a
multiracial and multispecial haven between the
fractured Thinrim and fraying worlds of Zeng
Subsector.
<P>
Beaxon has long recognised sophont rights, even when
its neighbors and the larger Imperial Government
seemed to spend more time observing these in speeches
and propaganda than in putting them into actual
practice. Freedom of speech and religion, and
observance of property rights are guaranteed by the
local charter, and the local government is a benign
civil service system overseen by political parties
with a long history of service. In the past the
bureaucracy took its role of preserving local freedoms
rather too seriously, and before the Collapse it had
ballooned into a massive, stagnant welfare state that
threatened the world's prosperity with heavy taxes,
and displaced private institutions that were better
able to serve the public in certain sectors. When the
IDP passed over the world, in large part because of
its less efficient government, a backlash led to
liberal market reforms, enabling the world to
accomplish a general technological improvement on its
own without Regency money or expertise.
<P>
Beaxon's massive accumulation of skilled workers and
giant industrial base attracted a good deal of
offworld investment. The Regency Navy has constructed
a number of private factories that build, in
conjunction with Askigaak, the bulk of their TL-15
material. Lintl and Tobia have also entered into long
term partnerships with their local cousins, with the
view of using local industry and infrastructure to
diversify their economies in expectation of a future
improvement to TL-16. For both worlds, advancement has
been hindered by technical and structural barriers
insurmountable by their own resources.
