This backwater world enjoyed a major population
increase as a result of the Collapse. The 1117
population lived entirely in boats or self-propelled
platforms, following schools of certain fish that
sustained them. The 1202 population lives in specially
constructed floating cities and semi-submersible
factory ships that derive most of the world's income
from undersea strip mining. The population has become
highly factionalised, with violent disputes over
industrialisation, pollution and economic development.
Most of the factions are political clubs that dominate
community politics, and harbor extreme or sharp
differences of opinion. Commercial interests sponsored
by these clubs are the main proxies for conflict,
clashing over ownership of various natural resources,
and the world is barely held together by the local
technocratic government.
