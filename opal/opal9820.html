The Grudovo Pendant is a j-1 cluster of 13 worlds that
connects Tobia/Trojan Reach with neighboring
Usher/Reft. Originally a cluster of little economic
presence or importance, its economic value has risen
in proportion with the rising volume of trade that
passes between Lintl and Tobia.<P>

Berg was settled as a breadbasket world by Tobia in
822. Thick brush and weeds often take over the fallow
grain fields, and burning of these thickets by farmers
drives particulate matter into the atmosphere that can
be quite irritating to humans. Bergians are notorious
workaholics, and they hold faithfully to their
routine, and little tolerate offworlders who badger or
otherwise consume their time with trivial matters.
This "work before play" attitude explains the quick
assimilation of the Aslan Ihatei; to hate or single
them out for discrimination takes too much time and
effort away from what is considered to be important.
Berg's downport is relatively small for a world its
size, as most of the harvest is directly loaded from
the fields on to bulk carriers that have landed
nearby. The highport is another matter, with a
population of 135,000 people it is one of the largest
such facilities for a world of this size in the
Thinrim. Nearly two thirds of the traffic between
Colony Five or Lintl, and Tobia, passes through its
berths.
