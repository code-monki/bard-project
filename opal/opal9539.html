Since the Collapse the PO and FT blocs have fragmented
into four or five smaller blocs intent upon unifying
the world under their own banner. At the eve of the
Imperial Civil War, more than 250 nations existed on
Porozlo, a number divided roughly in half since by
consolidation wars, economic or political mergers, or
the result of demographic shifts to subtle for
offworlders to see. Despite its inclusion in the
Industrial Development Program, balkanisation has
fragmented whatever progress has been made, and in
some areas there has been a regression. Most TL-14
material is in the hands of the bloc leaders, who use
their military and economic dominance to bully or
conquer their neighbors. When this trend accelerated
after the Representational Reforms, Porozlo became the
first world to actually be DROPPED from the IDP, and
the loss of Regency seed money is the reason for its
drop in technology. Even more irritating for the
Regency government has been the growing presence of
corporate predators in these wars, an inversion of its
history. Many of these include notorious minotaurs
like JAX/TCP, Blackhawk and Sternmetal.
