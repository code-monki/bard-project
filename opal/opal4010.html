<H1>Starports of Madoc Subsector</H1>

 (Editor's note: This article refers to several worlds which are not in the canonical subsector, referees should feel free to adjust the worlds to those that are more suited to their individual campaigns. This article is set before the Collapse.)
 <P>
 This is intended as a colourful survey of the major
locally-run starports in Madoc.   I am assuming that,
with a few exceptions, the Imperium owns at least one
starport on every Imperial world, usually the largest
and always the highest class in the system.  However,
several cities and minor worlds may run their own local
port.  Moreover, local governments, corporations, and
organizations can build their own ports as well.
<P>
As an aside, the Imperium is also assumed to run
many starports outside of it's borders, in allied or politically
important worlds.  My interpretation of Imperial ID is
my own, and does not necessarily reflect canon.  Actually,
I tend to treat canon as just a set of guidelines rather than
hard-and-fast rules: You Have Been Warned.]

<P>
As a Scout, I *always* use the local starports rather than the
Imperial Main Port - it gives me an instant read on what the
local culture believes about itself, what face the planetary
government wants to show to the Imperium, what kind if tech is
locally available, how much money is swishing around.... After
some experience, you can even get information from the architecture
used, and the kind of paperwork the people give you to fill in!
<P>
(snip)
<P>
Now, take Jae-Bong Starport, on Kaesong.   Sure, the
metal "flag" on the pole outside isn't the Imperial Starburst, but
that's about the only *real* difference between this  A-class port
and any other solid, prosperous port in the Imperium. The
blare of languages on the intercoms, astonished immigrants
offworld for the first time, the hustle of merchants, wailing
children, VIP's with their servants and aides trailing behind
them, it's all here, real as life.
<P>
Kaesong is a micro-G, near-vacuum environment, so you can amuse
yourself watching the offworld yokels try to get the hang of
manuvering around without looking like a *complete* idiot.  As
always, it's the kids who figure things out first, using the free small
plasic "wings", hand-held airscrews (muscle-powered or electric),
or just leap to the 5-meter high ceiling.  Watch out when they figure
out how to bounce around from wall to wall: twice here I got caught
in a rain of small children rocketing through the air, seeing how fast
they can fly off the walls.
<P>
Now, with most small-world, micro-G near-vacuum environments,
you can just leave the starship in the HighPort while you yourself
head to the LowPort.  Unusually for a small A-class types, however,
Jae-Bong Starport actually has two *pressurized, breathable,
shirt-sleeve* hangars on the world's surface available, capable
of handling up to 500 disp tons of starship each.  I admit, it cost's
a bundle to lease, but it greatly speed's up repair work: I never go
anywhere else in the subsector to fix up _my_ baby.
<P>
Most port's, naturally enough, look like buildings from the inside,
with maybe a skylight or two and perhaps a small indoor garden.
Kaesong, on the other hand, is a proud and high-tech world, the
capital of the subsector, and the local government has spent
a *lot* of money making certainl publicly accessible areas - mainly
concessions and eateries  - look, feel,and smell as if you were
walking outdoors in a pleasent meadow, rather than in a dome on
a nearly-airless rock.  Factor in enough money to put a steady,
1G pull in the "Green Grove" - and ignore the unusual curve in the
"domed sky" - and the area is actually quite pleasant.
<P>
The inspiration for the place is *not* Terra or Vland, though,
but the "lost biosphere of Ilelish".  For those of you who
don't know your Imperial history, centuries ago Ilelish system
once had a truly famous and impressive range of wildlife, but
- - after evacuating the population - the planet was deliberately
blasted into a sterile desert at the end of the Ilelish Revolt in 435.
For a loyal subsector capital world like Kaesong, it's an
_interesting_ selection.  But of course, Kaesong wasn't always
a loyal subsector capital...
<P>

<P>
Two parsec's or so Rimward are the Vacare Systems - you know,
those mystics that that Sylean writer... uhh, what's his name?
Yeah, Odcicantah.  Odcicentath?  OK, *Odcic* then! Look, I was
raised in Rim Anglic, I can't *handle* the long names!  Anyways,
it's those mystics that Odcic was so enthralled about.  The largest
port that they run is at NightVision, and it's got to be the most
gorgeous port in the subsector.  I know people who skip right
over the ho-hum Imperial Port, and land at Neustria Starport just
for the eye candy!
<P>
The place from the air looks like a flawless temple, maybe one of
those famous ones at Vland Sector or the early Roge shrines in
Dagudashaag Sector.  The geometry, the colours, even the way
the light hits the Ternstone blocks - it takes your breath away.
<P>
When you land there, everything is done in a even pace, gentle
but efficent.  There is often local music in the air - not piped in,
but actual singers and woodwinds playing in the port.  The place
is at TL E, but the people use the technology, instead of the other
way around.  There is the scent of incense in the air: different
"flavours" are used, depending on a host of things: the time of
day and year, if there is an honoured guest on the world, etc.
<P>
There are no native lifeforms on NightVision, but they managed
to repair the old Vilani-style biosphere across the planet, and in
the "food zones" they even have created thick layer of topsoil
( "The most valuable mineral in the Imperium", as the Ministry
of Colonization likes to put it. )  They often give a thimble of
this valuable soil to visitors who arrive, and a small, handmade
crystal sculpture, symbolizing the Void, to departing visitors.
Yeah, I know: more tourist junk to toss.  Still, it might be a nice
think to ship to a loved one: even if they're at the other side of the
Imperium, it can't cost more than a few hundred credits....
<P>
Another thing is the range of sophonts on the system:
there is a good deal of Vacare believers who are nonhumans,
about 2% or so of the population.  They have tended to congregate
in starport operations, so about 50% of the employees here aren't
human at all, but are instead from a range of species from Delphi and
Old Expanses Sectors.  If you aren't human, *this* is the world to
base your operations in.
<P>
(snip)
<P>
Now, every Traveller knows that there is always at least *one*
world in the subsector that is completely taken over by control freaks:
Kelvin, way over at the Spinward-Trailing corner of the subsector -
certainly fit's the bill.  And does the starport show it!  Bioscans,
heat sensors, psi-scanners, everything that a xenophobic TL D
culture can afford to install is at Rousseau Access Point - the
locals refuse to call it a starport for some odd reason or another.
All these checks are in case you are smuggling...well, I don't know if
even the guards know what they are looking for, but whatever it is,
make sure that you don't have it.
<P>
As an experienced Traveller, you know that only people "In the
Emperor's Service" carry Imperial ID.  This is mainly because trying to
gather, keep up to date, and insure the accuracy of data on any larger
population - across interstellar distances and multiyear timeframes - is
simply laughable.  Even today, we still remember the rare (?) case
of an Imperial Army General who was declared dead in Antares Sector
twenty years ago.  Seventeen years after his supposed death,
he was rediscovered living as a mercenary commander - AND
collecting his pension - in the Marches just three years ago (and it
took a year and a half for the news to reach Diaspora, incidentally.)
<P>
Unfortunately, nobody seems to have told the Community of
Reason on Kelvin that most people don't carry Imperial ID.  The local
Customs folk simply won't let you out of the starport if you don't have
your Imperial ID card.  Now, that doesn't stop planetary traders from
bringing their stuff *into* the starport for cross-shipping or pickup
by the locals, but it's a real bummer for more footloose Travellers, who
want to take a look around the place.
<P>
If you have the notation "IISS" on your Imperial  ID card, expect some
serious bureaucratic hurdles just leaving the starport.  For some reason,
they think that we are all spies ( with a bright red Imperial Starburst on
my uniform shoulder and my right chest?  I Think Not! ).  Some Scouts
manage to get a pass to leave the starport and see the world, some don't:
it strictly depends on your people skills.
<P>
May I modestly add that *I* managed not only to leave the starport
whenever I wished, but the offical decided that I didn't even need a
"Guide"?  Social engineering, people, social engineering!  Of course,
good looks and famous charm had absolutely *nothing* to do with it!
<P>
OK, back to the port.  The place is built like a set of concrete barracks,
and has enough troops to be one, so leave the toys back on the ship.
Well, most of them, anyway - The Guy's with the Gun's don't worry
about knives and other melee weapons.  This is mainly a cargo port,
so there just isn't much luxury available, but the place is kept clean
and reasonably efficent.  A good deal of traffic runs through the port,
including the rare, twice-a-year large freighter from the Solomani
Confederation: the locals still have a sentimental attachment to that
starnation, and devour's any news or entertainment goods from those
systems.
<P>
I know what you're going to ask me: what about those billions
and billions of people, dreaming away in their WorkPods?  Well, you
just don't see any of that in the local port: there is no great rush of
migrants trying to leave the world, and - besides the enormous amount
of medical equipment being shipped in - you couldn't know about the
WorkPods by just looking around.  I might talk more about it, if enough
of you bother my publisher about it.
<P>
(snip)
<P>
OK, on to the last major, system-run port in the subsector:
Tyrannus Starport.   This is a very *Ogadzi* port: almost everyone
you see here is part of the same race, and the same Ismya Christian
faith.  What interesting as you come in is the fairly large percentage
of ships from the Ogadzi Diaspora, mainly from throughout Diaspora
Sector, with a very occasional representative from Alpha Crucis.  As the
Solomani dominate Alpha Crucis, it's harder for mixed-race Ogadzi to
obtain a starship there, but such feats have been known to happen.
<P>
You can tell that this is *not* your everyday starport right away.
At the spots where you usually would see a portrait of the Emperor or
the planetary leader, you see a granite plaque with these words
carved on it, in raised relief:
<P>
"Praise ye the Lord.  Sing unto the LORD a new song,
    and his praise in the congregation of saints.
Let Isreal rejoice in him that made him:
    let the children of Zion be joyful in their King.
Let them praise his name in the dance: let them sing praises
    unto him with the timbrel and harp.
For the LORD taketh pleasure in his people:
    he will beautify the meek with salvation.
Let the saints be joyful in glory:
    let them sing aloud upon their beds.
Let the high praises of God be in their mouth,
    and a two-edged sword in their hand
To execute vengeance upon the heathen,
    and punishment upon the people;
To bind their kings with chains,
    and their nobles with fetters of iron;
To execute upon them the judgement written:
    this honour have all his saints.
Praise ye the LORD."
   - Psalm 149
<P>
Not exactly a gentle introduction, but it does get straight
to the point.  The port itself is built on the triangle/circle
motifs that the Ismya Christians so love, with the work sections
walled with an slightly shimmering silver-crimson metal.
The passenger and public access areas are quite graceful if
austure, with walls faced with expensive red marble with a
band of Jerusalem limestone running along the middle of the
wall, parallel to the smooth flagstones on the floor.  On the
limestone is engraved numerous scenes of starport life: ships
landing and departing, people meeting and hugging each other,
cargo being auctioned, pickpockets being chased down, etc.
<P>
Most of the locals hold the Way of the Tyrant as an esthetic
that shapes their lives, their actions and their way of living:
the influence of the Way can be seen in local food, sports, phases,
etc.  In front of the starport, for example, that quote from Psalm
149 symbolises "Law", while the pictoral representations of the
starships represents "Duty".  If you look around, you can also
find portrayals of "Blood", "Water" and "Purity".
<P>
Now, I don't *look* Ogadzi, so right away I'm an outsider.  With the
red Imperial Starbursts on my uniform, everyone shut's up when I
enter a room, and wait's for me to leave or shifts to whisper mode.
Eventually, a neatly dressed young man - followed by two large men
who practically scream SECURITY - politely told me to either complete
my business or leave, as this port is "not for tourists".
<P>
I could not spend much time in the port, as I always get hustled out the
door and could barely get anywhere in the port without being stuck by
mysteriously locking doors, running into grim-faced Security men, or
having my way blocked by Ogadzi merchants with crossed arms.  I'm
sure that the only reason why I didn't have a gun pointed at me was
because of my uniform: but I'm also certain that if I had pressed hard
enough they would have used their electric shockers, the nearest blunt
instrument, or their fist's if worst comes to worst.
<P>
If you start looking around you'll quickly notice that the people
employed by Ogadzi starports are nearly exclusively *men* - the
Ogadzi culture and the Ismya religion are definitely patriarchial
structures, and the duty of women to raise their children well is
expected to take precedence over other pleasures or employment.
Moreover, starports are seen as dangerous areas ( from environmental
risks to diseases to firefights among the passengers ): the lives of
Ogadzi women are seen as less disposable then Ogadzi men's, so
they are barred from employment there.  Nonhumans are allowed to
work in Ogadzi starports as translators, guides, and vendors, but are
kept away from the starships, the berths and hangers, and any other
sensitive areas.  Interestingly, however, the janitorial and muscle
jobs are strictly reserved for Ismya believers (maybe as a form
of penance?)
<P>
Interestingly, there is a good deal of traffic around, mainly in-system
commerce and emigration to seek out more opportunity elsewhere
in Diaspora.  It's mainly local free traders and the small local lines:
the larger Sectorwide-plus lines use the Imperial Starport instead.
Some of the local free traders are affilitated with one of the Church
Militant organizations - either openly or covertly - so I definitely
advise caution if you plan to do something of questionable legality
here.
