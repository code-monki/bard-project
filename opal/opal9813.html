Fissolon is a backwater water world with a few
interesting mineral resources, and little else. Nearly
all of the world is covered in water, with a few
islands scattered about the surface. The world is home
to two antagonistic communities, a majority Florian
colony, and a sizeable grouping of Droyne. The two
groups, despite their similarities in cultural
outlook, have never gotten along.
<P>
This anatagonism is a relic inherited from the
original Solomani inhabitants. The Solomani were
disinterested in the barren islands on the surface,
and were happy with free-floating city-ships that
sailed from one mineral source to another.  The Droyne
arrived insystem in 177, and were granted the barren
islands for inhabitation by the human population
rather than any place within the main community.  But
as populations soared within the city-ships, requiring
the creation of more permanent habitats and the
development of more diverse food sources, the Droyne
barred the human populace from their rapidly greening
islands, remembering their earlier mistreatment.
<P>
Tensions between the two groups boiled over in a
general world war, a war that the humans lost, and the
Florians took over Fissolon in 383. For most of the
world's history, the Florian rulers were able to
balance the two groups needs against each other, and
make both communities cooperate, even if grudgingly. A
workable combination of trade and reciprocal relations
kept the peace between them, and allowed for a
semi-equitable distribution of resources. Development
of the world was not a high-priority for the Florians
in those days, and the government could act as a
neutral body that could enforce the law with the
highest standards of integrity.
<P>
But as the Florian component of the population
continued to grow, it overtook the original native
human population and began to displace it. The
Solomani split into several camps, and either adapted
to the Florians in various ways, or were absorbed
within the Droyne community.  As the Florians began
using their neutral position to advance their own
agenda, it placed them increasingly at odds with the
Droyne.  The demands made upon their agricultural
output by the world and League governments has often
escalated into brief but bloody wars waged mostly with
Solomani mercenary and subject forces trained and
maintained for such purposes.
<P>
The last Island War occured in 1153 and ended in a
stalemate like most of the others. The Florian League
has attempted to defuse the tensions between the
Droyne and the planetary authorities, but with little
success. The reason for the wars have shifted from
legitimate grievances to economic survival: war is
good buisness for everyone.  Most fighting is strictly
controlled by prearranged rules of engagement, and
much of it occurs away from inhabited areas on remote
beaches and atolls.
<P>
Fissolon's economy has sputtered as the mineral
deposits have played out. Aquaculture and minor
manufacturing in support of the League's main
production centers are the primary employers in
peacetime, and these do not attract much profit.
Therefore military industries have become the main
drivers of conflict, and exports of cheap TL 7-9
weapons are a major source of income, much to the
dismay of the peaceable Florian mainstream.
<P>
Fissolon is a rather unattractive world for most
traders anyway. The world's algae expell large amounts
of halogenic vapor into the atmosphere, giving a
green-brown haze from chlorine and iodine vapor. The
local food is an aquired taste thanks to this taint,
and little of it is palatable to offworld consumers.
