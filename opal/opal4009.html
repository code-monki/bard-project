  A small pre-collapse backwater system whose main purpose was to function as the main 
entry point between the Alurzan Loop and the Eberly Corridor. The population 
of a mere 2,0000 was primarily occupied  in maintaining the class B port facility built by a trade consortium. The remaining population earned a living through farming and limited mining. 
<P>
   During the Rebellion, trade in the region dried up and most moved to more prosperous areas, chiefly the emerging  Unity of Promise. The class B orbital facility was closed down  and sufficient technicians remained to maintain the dirt side facilities to a C rating.
 There was a brief resurgence of the economy when the world became one of the stops of
 the  Thicket Run, a jump-2 trade route linking the Remington  shipyards to their main customer the Unity of Promise.
<P>
  As Virus swept the sector, the port took a few hits but local technology had slip down to TL-7 well before this time, and so created  few other casualties. The port manage to maintain it C rating and became a common stop for the sector`s Free Traders. In 1176
The Merchant Guild took over control and re-opened the orbital facility using items salvaged from throughout the sector. The takeover was gradual and received little opposition as the Guild brought prosperity and a steady flow of off-world goods.
<P>
  The listed tech level of 3 represent local general capability. In actuality   the the standard of living is closer to  7-9 thanks to a steady flow of off-world imports mostly from neighboring Wescap.  This is necessary  because close to 90% of the population is either employed at the port or in related activity, such as the thriving recreation facilities.
  The planet's populated area is divided into three districts. First and formost is the port area, where the bulk on the economy is concentrated. The port is subdivided into three areas. There is the orbital complex, nick-named the Yards  which handles maintenance on the Guilds large and or unstreamlined vessel. The yard are also capable of building non-jump capable spacecraft  of various types depending on available parts but concentrates on maintenance and the reconditioning of relics. 
<P>
  The downport  facilities are by far the most extensive and handle the bulk of the Guild 
smaller trade vessels. Adjacent to the downport  is the what`s known as the Parking, effectively a class D facility used by visiting ships on R&R or who don not have immediate 
need of maintenance. This area was created to free the more valuable maintenance berths. The port's various machine shops can replicate parts ranging from TL-9 to TL-14 depending on the complexity of the parts.
<P>
  Located right outside the port is the main settlement simply refered to a StarTown.
Is a collection of  bars, casinos, restaurant and any other imaginable types of recreation facilities. The is where most of the population not employed at the port live and work.
<P>

  Although  the world is rated as having a law level of 11, this only applies to the ports whose facilities are too precious to allow being damaged and behavior within 
its walls are strictly regulated. The actual law level outside the port is closer to 2.
The listed TED type government is the port master who is charged by the Guild council to
keep the facilities running. The lower law level also applies to the Parking  subport.
<P>

The last areas is simply know as the Farms. It is a collection of  four small hamlets each with a population of  under 100. As the named implies these are primarily used to provide a local source of food. The farms are highly mechanized to TL-8 standards. 
<P>
 Of note is the Hamlet of  Red Creek, which is home the the Red Creek brewry. The
company  has an  extensive line of products, including three types of ale, some wine and 
hard liquor. Its is the primary supplier of spirits to the Startown  establishments and over 
the years has gained a certain degree of recognition offworld. Mostly on Wescap and other important Guild worlds. As such Red Creek supports a larger population then the other
three hamlets.  It could be considered a village, although most of its workers commute to 
StarTown, which is less then an hour away by daily company bus.
<P>
  Since most of the population is concentrated around the port,the primary mode of transport is by ground vehicles with dirt roads linking the hamlets to Startown.  Due to the high degree of offworld traffic, grav vehicles are also fairly common. The streets in Startown are paved. 
<P>
   Because of this high traffic volume, relics of all kind are plentiful. Almost anything can be found if one has both time and money. The slave traded is rather limited as most locals take a dim view of such things and it is mostly restricted to the "entertainment" industry. 
<P>
   The Guild has brought prosperity to the world and so most are well disposed toward 
it, but at the same time most are open to any business proposition regardless of origin.
<P>
   Finally the last noteworthy feature of the planets is the Guild Merchant academy.
This was created years ago in order to maintain a trained pool of technicians for the port and was gradually expanded to included all facets of ship operations. The school is run by older retired spacers and has ties to its counterpart on Justabit.  
<P>
