L'sis was conquered by several corsair groups allied
to the Assemblage of 1116. These groups proved too
numerous and well dispersed for the Regency forces to
dislodge, and most were declared fait accompli. Most
of the Vargr invaders were located in a series of high
intermontane plateaus that contained most of the
world's settlements and industries, and their
legitimisation forced millions of humans to emigrate
into the dry deserts and savannahs of the equatorial
regions. In contrast to Riacon, human and Vargr
communities rarely intermingle, and fighting
frequently occurs where they come in contact with each
other. The situation has not been helped by the
political fragmentation that exists within both
groups, and the world will probably never recover
political unity anytime soon. The downport is
controlled by the Regency Ministry of the Interior as
a means of providing equal access to all local groups.
