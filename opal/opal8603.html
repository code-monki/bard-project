Mazirbe wasn�t always a backwater world. Mazirbe was initially settled in
315 to serve as a base of operations to take advantage of the system�s two
asteroid belts. The thinking was to have belters mine the ore from the
asteroids and haul the ore to Mazirbe for refining. Transporting the refined
ore, as opposed to bulk material, would save on transportation costs. And,
for a while, Mazirbe was a prosperous world. Unfortunately, both asteroid
belts were mainly composed of carbonaceous asteroids. Although the
occasional independent belter still makes a find, the nickel-iron asteroids
were mined out in just a couple of centuries, leaving the inhabitants of
Mazirbe without a primary export product. Those who could afford to leave
did.
<P>
For those who stayed behind, a new source of income was desperately needed.
Mazirbe�s primary, Teivosun, is an orange giant. Despite being 19.6 AU�s
away, Mazirbe bakes at an average temperature of 62 degrees Celsius. These
harsh climatic conditions ruled out agriculture. In fact, below 45 degrees
latitude, no vegetation exists at all. And between 45 and 55 degrees
latitude it is only during the winter years that plant life makes any
progress. During the summer years, spores and seeds lay dormant, waiting for
autumn rains in order to germinate.
<P>
Despite the blistering temperatures, 30% of Mazirbe�s surface is covered
with water. Over the millennia, most bodies of water have proven to be
stable above 35 degrees latitude, though exceptions exist. Despite the high
salinity of the world�s seas, Teivosun evaporates square kilometers of water
from them every day. But at night, temperatures drop nearly 44 degrees
Celsius! Mazirbe�s thin atmosphere can�t hold its heat so all the water that
evaporated during the day rains back down to the surface at night.
<P>
It was Mazirbe�s climate that proved to be a clue to its source of income.
During the summer years, when temperatures are even warmer, huge salt flats
lay exposed for dozens of kilometers. Gypsum has become the world�s primary
export. Although unable to become an agricultural world itself, Mazirbe
helps out agricultural worlds by providing them with fertilizers.
<P>
Unfortunately, there wasn�t a lot of money in salt. Mazirbe�s infrastructure
continued to decline. It finally stabilized at TL4. Despite this, Mazirbe�s
inhabitants remained upbeat with their simple existence. Each Presidente del
Mazirbe, a dictator elected for life, tended to enjoy a sedentary populace
that didn�t complain about its predicament. Dissenters, if any, emigrated.
As such, law enforcement tended to be moderate.
<P>
While the Civil War raged on, life on Mazirbe remained quiet. The only real
event that occurred was the Jonkeeren Land Deal, better known locally as
Sand For Suckers. Mazirbe received several million credits from the Domain
of Deneb as compensation for the establishment of a Jonkeeren colony within
the great equatorial desert. The settlement was small, only 5,000
individuals, but it was land that the natives of Mazirbe thought to be
completely useless due to its uninhabitability. El Presidente received
praise galore for outwitting the lofty Imperials.
<P>
But Fate is fickle. And she is as likely to give, as she is to take away.
<P>
When the Quarantine was declared, Mazirbe found itself situated within the
Regency Frontier. Although it was an undesirable position, it was livable.
But then, the Regency decided that Vargr refugees would be permitted to
settle Mazirbe as well. Not just a few thousand, but rather a few hundred
thousand. Unlike the Jonkeeren, this new batch of immigrants came without
compensation, and they certainly didn�t want to live out in the desert. This
was too much for the population to bear. They protested loudly. Even El
Presidente petitioned the Regency for a redress of grievances. The two sides
finally settled on emigration for those within the populace who wanted to
leave, with the Regency picking up the tab.
<P>
It was another case of Monkey Flight (see Pangumo/Deneb 0815), as the
Vargr call it. 82% of the population bolted for worlds within the Regency
interior. Even the government shut itself down and closed up shop. Worried
about the potential chaos that could ensue from the power vacuum, the RISS
stepped in to administer the world as an interim government. The new
government, which grew out of the scout base administration, is simply a
civil service bureaucracy. Both Human and Vargr are represented. Jonkeeren
don�t seem to care too much about the government as legislation is rarely
passed that affects life in the desert.
<P>
Among the Vargr refugees that came to settle this world are some of the
Gvaekuers (see Deneb Library Information: </B>The Pack), a former Kforuz
splinter group. A life of mining salt was not palatable to them. And there
isn�t a Vargr that does who has any sort of charisma to them. These
descendants of corsairs despise the Quarantine. Having never lost the
corsair spirit, they rail against the restrictions imposed by the RQS and
constantly try to break Quarantine. Their ships run out into the Denebian
Wilds and Tuglikki, and have been rumored to have even gone as far away as
Provence and Corridor. And they�re not above firing on RQS ships if they
think they can get away with it.
<P>
As such, Mazirbe�s economy has begun to show a little more life again. Pack
money has found it�s way into the hands of the general public. Standard of
living conditions have shown some improvement. Even members of the human
population don�t seem to mind what the Gvaekuers are up to as it has come to
benefit them as well, via cash used to purchase local goods and services.
<P>
The more law-abiding members of society, Vargr and Human alike, have sought
an end to this surly behavior. Law enforcement has been beefed up, giving
the world its law level rating of 9, but the local tech level leaves few
tools at their disposal. The RISS, who never left, lend a hand to try and
help root out Gvaekuers smuggling, but for every ship caught at least two
more get away.
<P>
It is this uncontrolled atmosphere that led to Mazirbe getting passed over
for the lucrative Safeside Terminus status. Although Gvaekuers smuggling may
boost its economy somewhat, Mazirbe will likely remain a backwater world for
some time.
