Previously a High Stellar balkanised world, it was unified after many years 
of fighting by a Warlord who set up a World Council. This Warlord, Gerraint Denran, took
a less interventionist role as the years went by, and eventually had himself proclaimed
Monarch of Dycarl. The Bureaucracy was left to rule Dycarl for it's people, with the 
Monarch only intervening in occasional matters. A corruption scandal in 1178 led to the
new Monarch, Jereela Denran, setting up an independent overview agency, and since then
things have been running more-or-less smoothly. The offer to join the <A HREF="../peri/peri0007.html">VTA</A> was embraced
with vigour, and currently it's TL is expected to reach 9 in 1202. Voskl has also 
provided the technical expertise to reactivate Dycarl's Starships, and it is the only
other system in the <A HREF="../peri/peri0007.html">VTA</A> to have a Jump-capable Space Force.<p>

The ships of the Royal Space Navy are 2 <i>Shukugan</i> SDBs, 1 <i>Fiery</i> Close Escort,
 2 armed 
<i>Beowulf</i> Free Traders, 1 armed <i>Petty</i> Subsidised Merchant and 1 armed Far Trader.<p>

The Air Force controls two relic Deep Mount Meson Guns, which ensure the safety of the 
planet more than the Space Navy, which wishes to gain control of them.<p>

Dycarl's merchant fleet is slightly smaller in comparison to Voskls, but for a world it's
size is very respectable.<p>


Population : 72,670,000. Ruled by Her Supreme Eminence's Government.<p>
