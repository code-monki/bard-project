Most of Wyn's human population fled the world during
the Vargr raids of the 1120s. Vargr squatters seized
most of the now undefended settlements during the
early days of the Abandonment, and fighting erupted
between factions. The local fungus taint is lethal to
Terran based life, and thousands of Vargr perished
before one faction prevailed in the fighting for
control of the world's filter mask production. That
faction, called the Zaekueto, uses the distribution of
filter masks and life support to control the entire
population. The elite own all property. Food and
medical care are distributed according to their whim
and the tender mercies of their Ofaroe police. The
surviving human population, and a good portion of the
Vargr, are enslaved directly by the Zaekueto, and work
menial or dangerous jobs.
