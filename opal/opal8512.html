Marz was formerly of the Domain of Deneb, and a high
population world that traded heavily with the Vargr
Extents. The world was severely damaged by raids from
the Assemblage of 1116, and a good portion of its
population had already evacuated to safeside well
before the Collapse. The Regency held on to the world
until 1141, when its inability to guarantee protection
compelled it to grant independence to Marz and nearby
Carthage (Deneb 0202).
<P>
Marz is still mostly human in population, but its
economy and political system have shifted towards the
Kforuzeng and its allies. The local dictator is a
former high ranking officer in the Kforuz
organisation, and the corsairs operate openly in the
system. Several Pack groups also are based in the
system, and several enjoy the backing of the
government and its sponsors. Marz is located
uncomfortably close to the junction between the
Regency, the Vargr Splinters, and the Wilds, and
several "mercenary" naval units are provided by the
Kforuz to defend the world against Vampire incursions,
and to deter raids by rival corsair groups still
operating in the Wilds.
