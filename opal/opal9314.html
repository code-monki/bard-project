Kulse is a very geologically active world within the
Kamrati cluster of worlds in the Avalar Consulate.
Kulse orbits its primary very closely, and the
gravitational interactions between it and the binary
star system creates massive heating within its mantle
and core. When approached from space, the glow from
massive volcanic activity is palpable even on the
dayside.
<P>
The constant heat from within destroyed the planets
original crust billions of years ago, and only a thin
crust has evolved since then. This crust is riddled
with huge fissures, through which huge rivers of
basaltic lava four to resurface the planet in hot
puddles of porous rock through which superheated gas
and steam is vented. The planet's insidious rating
comes from its extremely high surface temperature,
which ranges from 700 to 1600 degrees centrigrade.
What surface water the planet has is locked at the
poles in superhot oceans and lakes that collect and
condense all of the moisture in the atmosphere.
<P>
Most of the population lives either in specially
shielded colonies built on pylons or rock platforms
built in these seas, or in large orbital habitats in
geostationary orbit. That people settled such a
hellish world isn't really that mysterious or
astonishing.  The high surface temperatures made
certain industrial processes very cost efficient.
Most industry revolves around metal refinement,
ceramic fabrication, chemical processing, and some
mining. Refrigerated industries thrive here too, the
result of careful manipulation of coolant pumped
between the different temperature zones.
A set of secondary industries have evolved in orbit to
support these activities and passing space traffic,
giving the world a diverse enough economic base to
survive. Agriculture is accomplished through hothouse
greenhouses, into which locally obtained CO<sub>2</sub> gas and
some steam for humidity is piped in to enhance crop
yields. The planet's ruling authority was a governor
appointed by the old Kamrati League, from a pool of
local candidates based upon their professional acumen
and prestige. This system has worked so well that the
succeeding Consulate has left it in place without any
modifications.
<P>
Kulse's population is a dour and taciturn group,
eschewing most entertainment and fads or fashions.
They are a rather inventive group, as they prefer
lofty amateur academic and scientific pursuits during
their free time.  This has led to the creation of a
vital third industry for the world, a large array of
polytechnical colleges and their associated
laboratories.  The people are intensely intellectual,
an unusual departure from the norm among the
Consulate's lower social classes.  Even the lowliest
of the world's workers will assemble in cafes or park
centers within their communities, to hold forth in
debates flowing with well chosen and reasoned
arguments and rebuttals.  Some sociologists believe
that these discourses have two vital purposes: in
creating a belief system within a society reknowned
for its agnosticism towards all belief structures,
including scientific inquiry; and in creating a social
order and reinforcing the camaraderie of the
community.
