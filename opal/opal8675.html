White for the Solomani has different meanings. For
Europeans it represents purity, for Asians it
represents death. To the Vilani white is the color of
memory, of the dead past that nonetheless resonates
for the present generation. Two themes dominate the
local culture as a result: an emphasis upon
hospitality and entertainment, and the preservation of
memory.<P>

Thingen's surface was once covered in a huge world
ocean. Over the eons a massive amount of limestone
sediment was deposited. About half a billion years
many of these sediments were uplifted into continents
by tectonic action, and the heat transformed the
limestone into massive deposits of metamorphosed
marble. <P>

Because of their abundance these compose much of the
building material used in the world's cities, giving
it its nickname as the "White World." Older
settlements resemble the adobe or stone communities
that once dotted the equatorial or tropical regions of
Terra and Vland. Buildings are built close to one
another, and are often linked together on hilltops and
mesas. Towers that resemble Solomani minarets are a
common architectural feature. Spacious, well lit
footpaths wend their way between neighborhoods. The
urban culture that has developed is well renowned for
its tradition, authenticity of spirit, generosity and
communal spirit. <P>

Thingen was first settled in the 200s by Vilani
colonists from Lishun Sector. The world's continents
are located almost exclusively in the southern
hemisphere, and enjoy pleasant temperatures year
round. The local soils and climate were hospitable to
the colonists and their agriculture, and they never
suffered for want of food or clothing. Rich mineral
resources and strong offworld interest in the local
tourism industry brought more than enough income to
the world for comfort; because of the gentler
conditions, the population is somewhat atypical from
the accustomed Imperial or Regency norm.
<P>
Local society is concentric: the community begins with
the individual, whose status is influenced in large
part by his success and individual attainment. But
more important than the individual is his or her
extended family, which can include hundreds of
individuals. Local marriage strictures are quite
loose, and almost permit mutiple marriage. Divorce and
seperation are common, but no matter what
circumstances occur, distant relations by blood or
former relations by marriage proliferate because of
this structure. The accomodation of these kinship
structures, and the maintenance of family and
community traditions, explains where the two
predominant themes mentioned above originate.
<P>
Education and entertainment are the two main forms of
social glue for this society. Educational attainment
is heavily stressed because of the honor and prestige
it brings a family. But equally important as
professional careers are the local poets, artists and
singers who keep alive the living language of family
and individual experience. Every family has a "Cantor"
who presides in family ceremonies, performs marriages,
christenings and funerals, and who uses language and
imagery to encapsulate the past for future
generations. Cantors also act as family recordkeepers,
and represent the families interests in legal
proceedings. They also entertain at important
gatherings.
<P>
As a result of these tradition local economy
emphasises service industries, most notably education
and medical services. The world is home to Muriisdi
University, one of the largest and most prestigious
Ivy Curtain colleges. Unlike its counterparts on
Rhylanor and Magash, Muriisdi (Vilani for either
"Angel" or an angelic creature) has more emphasis upon
the professions (medicine, law) and academic sciences
than practical technical matters. The university
itself has a faculty and student population into the
tens of millions (most of them offworlders), and has
campuses scattered around the world. The world's
medical facilities are top notch, and attract millions
each year in search of cutting edge medical treatments
for a variety of diseases.<P>

One unusual sidenote about this world: Because of
space restrictions the local dead are disposed of by a
practice known as excarnation, whereby the corpses are
exposed to the open air, and are consumed by
scavengers in special atriums. The bones then are
either interred in the basements of local homes, or
are ground up and used as building material. The
former is preferred, but as crowding requires more and
more high density construction, the bones are now
usually incorporated, though are respectfully retained
by the family and recycled into their new dwellings.
