Formerly known as Sika'im. This barren rockball was
originally claimed and settled by the Imperial Navy in
388, and started out as a naval base and test range.
Just prior to the First Frontier War, the base was
upgraded into a full depot, charged with supporting
the entire region Behind the Claw. Despite the massive
area this entailed, so important was it for fleet
marshalling and resupply that when Olav Plankwell set
out for Core to wrest the Imperial throne from
Jacqueline, it was at Depot that he collected and
organised his fleet for the long journey. Eighteen
years later Arbellatra Alkhalikoi too set out for Core
from Depot, and in Navy traditions it became the
demarcation point between the Domain of Deneb and the
"rest" of the Imperium.
<P>
Depot Alpha is a very unimpressive rockball. The
system was largely settled because of its emptiness
and strategic location.  Most of the civilian
population lives in a group of five large settlements
set in a pair of nearly matching impact craters known
as the Bicycle. The small ridge of mountains that
seperate the two craters contains the civilian
downport. A shipyard owned by Ling Standard Products
is located in the Nightshirt crater about 200
kilometers, which produced ships that showcased the
Imperiums technological advances in antebellum times,
but now mostly produces TL-15 to 16 ships for real
jobs rather than propaganda.<P>
Civilians actually have a fairly comfortable life,
aside from periodic updates of their security
clearances by Naval Intelligence. Habitation on Alpha
is limited to personnel either directly employed by
the base, or in its supporting industries and
services. All housing is consigned by the Navy, which
doesn't have much tolerance for outside entrepenuers.
Licenses must be obtained for the operation of
entertainment, food concession and drinking
establishments, and these are primarily provided to
long standing residents or retired military personnel.
 Unlike its sister, Depot Beta, Alpha retains a fair
amount of the smug class pretensions of the old
Imperial Navy, and an ironclad pecking order exists at
all levels.  Even the supposedly free civilian
assembly and regulatory agencies tend to defer to
local military commanders and their underlings.
Moreover a strong local antipathy towards the
Representational Reforms is evident in the officer
clubs and NCO bars, sentiments that put it
increasingly at odds with both the Tower and the rest
of the Navy command structure.
<P>
About seventy percent of the world is covered in
military barracks, training grounds and administrative
offices, and much of it is accessible to civilians
with only a minor background check. But the heart of
Alpha is a vast collection of orbital facilities
around Sika'im itself, or around or on other nearby
celestial bodies. Most of these facilities are off
limits to civilians and unauthorised personnel, and
are defended by sentries with shoot to kill
authorisation.
<P>
Most famous of these facilities is the so called
Silver Lady, otherwise known as Plant 21, a massive
twenty million ton space habitat that houses one of
the Regency's most advanced shipyards and research
facilities. The Lady is responsible for nearly sixty
percent of the Regency's naval designs constructed
since the Collapse, and the facility houses its own
meson guns and monitor squadrons for self defense.
Alpha's two asteroid belts are used for weapons
testing and live fire exercises, and many areas are
offlimits. The innermost belt also contains a number
of labs and test facilities, and several factories all
engaged in generally classified work.
<P>
Alpha has been beset for decades by allegations of lax
security in regards to the Quarantine and anti-viral
measures. This follows the mysterious destruction of a
lab on the fringes of the outermost asteroid belt in
1145, leading to the deaths of nearly a hundred
personnel. Several investigations have turned up
similar security lapses which are never remedied
despite pledges to do so from successive commanding
officers and the local navy administration.
