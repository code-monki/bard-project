   Once the industrial capital of the Sarid/Oriflamme subsector L`steich`s population
perished quickly during the Collapse leaving behind huge amount of tl-15 material.
The world was later  periodically visited by Free Traders. With the emergence
of the Coalition salvage operation intensified mainly thanks to ships from Oriflamme .
Still  with a former population of 4.7 billion there is still plenty to recover.
<P>
  While the admittance of <a href="opal2070.html">Nex</A> to the Coalition was still under debate Oriflamme lost no  time and built  a refueling station in the ruins of the old IISS scout base . The idea was to establish a stable jump-2 route between Nex and Oriflamme . But the idea was also to set up a permanent salvage base in order to more thoroughly explore and thus clean out  the
world of it best recoverable items and make sure Oriflamme got the best pickings.
<P>
   The base has a population of 325 with facilities for an other 175. It operates as a class D facility thanks to a small pumping station and several restores storage tanks. There is a small  hangar with a machine shop able to provide minor repair. Major repair  parts
can be brought in from the Bourgund Shipyard on Oriflamme  and fitted by the on-staff
technicians.
<P>
 The port also sees traffic from ships heading to Poyzen .
