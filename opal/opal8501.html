Springarn was first settled around 450 years ago by a
Droyne Oytrip exiled from Zeen/Inar for unspecified
crimes.  Over the centuries human vagabonds have
trickled onto the world, and a few have been accepted
by the Droyne into their community. Because of the
overhanging threat of psionic persecution, the local
humans were careful not to arouse suspicion that would
have brought the Imperial authorities to clear out the
settlement. But since the Collapse, psionic
instruction has flowered on the world, and many human
schools have affiliation with the local droyne.
Springarn has few other attributes to recommend it,
and traders generally stop only long enough to refuel,
without mixing with the locals, who seem to prefer it
that way.
