Mowebe's atmosphere is home to a lethal microorganism
called Riker's Plague. The disease causes a flu-like
disease that will kill eighty percent of those it
infects. Fortunately a safe and effective vaccine
exists that protects the local populace and visitors,
and the only precaution is the decontamination
measures that are carried out on persons leaving the
world.
<P>
Unfortunately the world was another site of human
"monkey flight" in the wake of major inflows of Vargr
refugees. Most of these refugees are from the former
state known as the Windhorn Pact of Two, and are
highly nationalistic and sympathetic to the Pack. The
local Vargr population is borderline rebellious, and
large contingents of RQS are present to help keep a
lid on any trouble.
