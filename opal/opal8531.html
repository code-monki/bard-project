Krisna was originally settled by followers of an
ancient Terran religion known as Brahmanism. This
particular group worshipped a particular god known as
Vishnu the Preserver, and his eighth incarnation,
Krisna the Warrior. In keeping with many of their
faiths tenets, the local laws reflect a religious
orientation, particularly nonviolence and prohibitions
against the eating of certain animals. The Hindu caste
system is not practiced, however, and the world is
strongly Imperial in culture. Many of the major cities
are built with ancient Vedic themes, and many are
dominated by huge temples, statues and reliefs
constructed in the ancient Indian tradition. Buddhism
is also practiced, though it is a minority religion.
The government is actually a coalition of city and
local administrations rather than a centralised
structure. Most of the population lives in floating or
anchored habitats, many of them constructed around
large manmade harbors and canals designed to promote
sea commerce. Besides Krisna, locals are strongly
devoted to the Sea God, Varuna.
