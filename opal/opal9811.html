Trossachs is the Florian League's most heavily
populated world, and its largest exporter of goods and
services to other Spinward States.  Located within the
small cluster of worlds at the rimward end of
Menorial, its strategic location makes it the Leagues
main outlet to its markets in the Regency and Foreven
Sector.
<P>
Like most League worlds, Trossachs was originally
settled by Solomani colonists during the Long Night.
When contacted by the League in 134, the world was
balkanised between several rival factions armed with
nuclear weapons.  The League Navy set up a blockade
that coerced several states into League membership,
and Florian colonists began settling the world in the
late 100s.  Over the next seven centuries, the Florian
inflow slowly overwhelmed the other non-League
nations, and the world was unified by decree in 823.
However, the Florian population only makes up about a
third of the total, and some regions are predominantly
Solomani in lineage and culture.
<P>
The world has been an industrial world since the 600s,
and its cities were once grim and polluted from
neglect and decay.  In the period before the Third
Frontier War, the most polluted cities were abandoned
and their populations were relocated to several new
oceanic arcologies.  The ruins of these cities still
dot the countryside, and their pollution has slowly
subsided, allowing farms and suburbs to reside among
their ghostly empty towers and neighborhoods.  Most of
the population lives within the arcologies, and the
countryside has been left completely empty for
agriculture and ecological preserves.  Years of
wasteful dumping of industrial pollutants into the air
and water have left the atmosphere tainted, and it
will still be a couple of centuries before the taint
will settle out.
<P>
Trossachs main industries are oriented towards making
cheap consumer products for both the home and
international markets.  This runs the gamut from
consumer electronics to civilian transport products
like grav vehicles.  The local shipyards produce cheap
TL-13 starships for commercial interests throughout
the Spin Extents, and include major corporate clients
in the Regency.  The volume of trade that visits the
world is significant, and the world's starports and
trade facilities rate as its second largest industry.
Many traders within the four corner region of
Menorial, Urnian, Five Sisters and Marrekesh patronise
the world as their primary maintenance facility.
<P>
Trossachs is also famous, or infamous, for its vast
number of corporate holdings. In antebellum times the
world was a major hub for corporate and government
intrigue waged between legitimate and dummy
corporations for one power or the other. Imperial and
Zhodani intelligence services maintained a number of
safehouses and support facilities for their operations
in the Reach, and covert wars erupted between these
groups from time to time. Trade wars between rival
corporations were also raging much of the time,
featuring mostly usual suspects like LSP and
Sternmetal, BT and McClellan Factors, SusAG and
Delgado. These activities have cooled considerably
since the Collapse, though simmering tensions still
exist between rival shipping corps, and new tensions
have arisen between new corporate players.
