Bestala is a typical mediocre world, with one saving
grace. Aside from a few useful organics the system had
few resources to attract major colonisation. But the
system had location, sitting aside the shortest route
through Piah subsector from Urnian. The draconian
trade policies of the Avalar Consulate further
enhanced the worlds antebellum value, and it became a
base for Imperial traders and smugglers.
<P>
It is not a popular world to visit. The local
atmosphere is tainted with peculiar microorganisms,
that, while posing no direct danger to humans, have an
unusual effect upon human metabolism.  When these bugs
enter the bloodstream, they alter the bodies chemistry
slightly, causing uric acid to precipitate out as
needle shaped crystals. These crystals are deposited
within the joints, particularly the legs and feet,
creating gout within ninety five percent of all humans
who visit and live on the world.
<P>
No cure exists for this disease, also called Bestalan
Gout. Only severe diet modification and constant
exercise can stave off its development. Visitors are
subjected to a primarily vegetarian diet, are required
to exercise at least a hour a day, and must eschew
alcoholic beverages. Despite this regimen, a
significant number of visitors, and the such as the
elderly, depressed and infirm portions of the
population, allow themselves to succumb to the
disease. As the disease progresses, the pain will
become so great as to compell suicidal tendencies in
the sufferer. It is no suprise then that Bestala has
one of the highest suicide rates in the sector, which
gives rise to the morbid local joke "when in gout,
shoot."
<P>
Although the expansion of Avalaran borders has
corraled the formerly wildcat flow of trade from
Bestala, the world remains independent of Consulate
interference. Under the watchful eyes of RN and RQS
patrols, outside trading companies have been able to
construct their regional headquarters, logistic
centers and M&R stations for their operations, even
though most crews would prefer not to visit the world
for any reason. Barracai Technum/Leviathan, Aster
Nova, and McClellan/Sovereign are the dominant
shipping companies on the world, and also manage large
cargo brokerages that coordinate with independent
traders.
