<H5>Durga:</H5>
The Durga is a large, omnivore, marsupial creature native to 
Phoebus's highlands.  There are two distinct subspecies, the 
larger mountain variety and the smaller hill Durga.  The Durga 
is constantly eating and it will eat anything in its path, 
from bushes to carrion.  The  Durga has large nasal cavities 
that connects with its throat; this allows the Durga to make 
loud bellowing noises.  The durga herds use these sounds to 
communicate across the mountains.  The communication is fairly 
primitive, used mainly to let other herds know that a 
competitor is in the region, so that the two herds can avoid 
each other.  The herds avoid each other in order not to 
overgraze their territory.  A herd in the wild is made up of 
an equal number of male  and female durgas.  Durgas mate in 
the early spring, the pregnancy lasts six months, and the 
young is born in early summer. Durgas never have multiple 
births.  The young is about the size of large piglet, and is 
stored in a pouch on the mother's underside.  <P>

The skin of a Durga is a matte black, except for a brightly 
colored streak that runs from the tip of the tail, along the 
spine, to the brow where it branches out to cover the entire 
head.  The colors are quite varied, the most common colors are 
yellows and greens, but blues and reds are not unheard of.  
Each beast weighs about 2 metric tons, is about 3 meters long, 
and 1 meter high.  They are fairly slow and very stupid. They 
are primarily used for meat, but almost all of the carcass is 
used for something. Farmers are able to get significant 
amounts of milk, from female durgas.  This is not as much as 
Terran cattle, but the farmers are able to make cheese and 
other dairy products from it.  The Phoebans make an alcoholic 
drink name drakva from the fermented blood of young durgas.  
So far they have not found much of an export market for this 
drink, but they are still trying.<P>

<A NAME="HISTORY"><H3>History</H3></A>

Fuetz, as Phoebus was originally called, was rediscovered in 200.  
During the early part of her existence, Fuetz was nothing more 
than a mining colony from Vras (Aubaine) where many prospectors 
spent their lives trying to "strike it rich" on the planet.  Then 
in 1036, an independent miner discovered a mother load of Iridium.  
The miner's name was Elan Diego. Fuetz capital and only city is 
named for him.<P>

When word of Elan's discovery got out, Fuetz developed almost 
overnight.  Many businesses moved in to try to get in on the 
profits.  Within months, Fuetz was one of the quickest growing 
worlds in the Old Expanses.  Many entrepreneurs moved into the 
city looking to earn a quick credit from the miners who lived in 
the city.  Bars and brothels were slung up on every corner to 
fulfill the needs of the miners on Fuetz.  Fuetz was truly a 
boomtown planet.<P>

Then in 1101, the mine played out.  Many of the prospectors 
worked the area to try to find more of the precious metal, but 
no one was successful.  The situation on Fuetz quickly 
degenerated, and eventually the subsector duke was called upon to 
institute martial law.  The population on Feutz dropped a little, 
but most of the people there were simple, poor miners, 
prostitutes, and bar tenders without enough credits to get 
offplanet.<P>

During the following years, Feutz stabilized under martial law 
and eventually the Subsector Duke removed the martial law, but 
left his representative, Braylan Garett, there to "keep an eye on 
things."  It was the wisdom and guidance of Braylan Garett that 
kept the population of Feutz from extinction during the Final War 
and Collapse.<P>

In 1131, Virus reached Feutz.  Many of the populace were killed 
almost immediately when the gravity generators that helped hold 
up mine shafts shut themselves off.  Those who were not killed 
immediately were left to fight for survival on the near barren 
world.<P>

Braylan Garett was quick to react.  He appointed himself as Lord 
Regent, divided the land into manors, and set up the most 
influential and powerful people as citizens and manor directors.  
Most of the citizens were assigned the task of providing food, 
either from growing plants, or durga herding.<P>

Fuetz was not unharmed by Virus, but through careful planning and 
quick reaction, some were able to survive.  Shortly after Feutz 
was recontacted by the Reformation Coalition, the RC offered 
Fuetz membership, and they accepted.  Feutz changed its name, 
like many other worlds.  The new name, Phoebus, symbolizes the 
hope that the RC brings.<P>

Since being recontacted by the Coalition, several bootstrap 
missions have been launched to help raise the sustainable tech 
level, but it is slow going.  Some of the problems stem from the 
stubbornness of the current Lord Regent, Delvin Garett.  It seems 
that Garett is unwilling to ask for help from the Aubaine Relief 
Teams on the planet for fear that he will show his dependence on 
Aubaine.  While the Lord Regent has been assured that this will 
not be the case, he still holds his opinion.  Lord Regent Garett 
has however allowed Aubaine teams to help his people in lifting 
the tech level of the planet.<P>

<A NAME="Economics"><H3>Economics</H3></A>

Agriculture on Phoebus is revolves around the Durga, a large 
lizard looking beast.  The Durga is actually warm blooded, but 
its tough leathery hide and long tail, make it look more like a 
Terran lizard than anything  else.  The durga is a marsupial, 
nursing its young in a pouch on the underside of the female.  
The durgas are omnivores they will scour the landscape, eating 
anything and everything in their path.  The residents have to be 
very careful what they leave near a durga, because the durga will 
try to eat anything. Many a tourist have lost their holovid bags, 
while filming a durga herd.<P>

Almost all clothing on the planet is make from durga hide.  There 
are several reasons for this.  The durga hide makes very sturdy 
clothing providing warmth and protection from the elements and 
at the same time is very resistant to wear. Also there are not 
large quantities of plants to extract comfortable cloth from.  
The soil is rocky and shallow and Phoeban agriculture desperately 
lacks enough of the equipment needed to effectively till the soil. 
Even the native plants have a hard time growing.  What plant that 
does grow is fairly hostile to human life.  It has a quite 
different biochemistry and very little of it is edible.  The 
Phoebans have found a small tuber, bleckban, and a weedy grain, 
kalea, that are  edible to humans; however, these plants are 
difficult to grow domestically and scarce in the wild.<P>

Phoeban agriculture is very scattered. There are many small 
gardens in the city, which are tended by the unemployed. They 
careful tend these plots, fertilizing the soil, with treated 
human waste and anything else that would help supply needed 
nutrients. There are farms outside the city. These mainly raise 
durgas.  Durga ranching is effective but slow because  the lack 
of adequate riding animals on Phoebus.  Phoeban "Lizardboys" have 
to either ride the  lethargic animals themselves or walk.  This 
limits herd size and makes  cross country durga drives very 
difficult. A small number of horses do exist but they  are 
difficult to feed on the scarce grains available.<P>

There is not enough durga breeding stock or farming equipment to 
allow an expansion of farming under the manor system.  The 
Phoeban citizens are also unwilling to give up their control over 
the land.  Their response is to provide a bare subsistence ration 
to the urban jobless.  The RC is trying to persuade the citizens 
to undertake land-reform, but it is slow going.  The Citizen's 
contend that what they need is not more  TL-0 agriculture but 
more TL-3 or even 4 agriculture.  Further, they believe the RC  
should focus on developing Phoeban industry to the point that 
the manors  will have enough equipment to bring all of their land 
under cultivation.<P>

In the meantime, RC is trying to encourage a practice of the 
urban poor that has existed since the collapse.  Areas of the old 
city are cleared of rubble, to reclaim the few TL-12 materials 
that Phoeban industry is capable of re-using.  The work is mostly 
done by the poor who sell it for a tiny amount.  As areas are 
cleared, the local inhabitants plant urban gardens to supplement 
the bland lizard broth and cheese they receive from the Citizens.  
It is all TL-0/1 agriculture, but the RC hopes that if more 
people could be moved out of the city, they might be able to 
produce enough to support themselves. <P>

The RC has launched a bootstrap mission to Phoebus. The mission 
has started a small school in the city to educate the Phoeban 
children.  The mission is also involved in helping educate the 
farmers in better agriculture techniques.  The Hivers of the 
Seabridge Nest on Ra have recently introduced a few new plant 
varieties that should grow in the poor soil.  This is the first 
year of crops for the new strains, so the success of the project 
is not yet known.<P>

The bootstrap mission is made up of personnel from Aubaine, and 
<A HREF="opal1000.html">Helios</A>.  The Helios personnel are able 
to bring a unique perspective to the work. They come from a 
planet that has a technological level only a bit above that of 
Phoebus.  While the Aubani can be arrogant about their 
technological superiority, the Heliosians are very humble and 
glad to help their fellow reformers.  This helps ease the 
tensions that might arise between the Centrist Phoebans and the 
personnel from the two Federalist worlds.  <P>

Most outside observers feel that the Phoebans live fairly 
miserable lives, but the Phoebans have grown used to their 
lifestyle, and have developed a  society wide contentment.   
This is starting to change, as the people see what the rest of 
the RC is like.  The people are starting to put pressure on the 
Council of Citizens to  increase the quality of the life on 
Phoebus.  The non-citizens want some of the technological devices 
that they see offworlders using.<P>

The Council of Citizens does not have any excess money, to buy 
expensive off world luxury items.  They realize that if the 
non-citizens want off world goods, that the non-citizens will 
have to work more. Most non-citizens are used to not working, and 
are loath to change this.  The Council has started to pressure 
the RC to give them  more assistance. The Council is upset that 
many resources are being spent on planets in the Wilds that are 
already better off than Phoebus.  The RC is willing to help but 
wants the Council to institute some reforms.  The Council, 
however, is unwilling to start changing the very foundations of 
their civilization, and many of the RC advisors are becoming 
increasingly frustrated by the Council's  stubbornness.<P>

<A NAME="CULTURE"><H3>Culture</H3></A>

Elan Diego is the capital of the planet; about five thousand 
people make it their home.  It surrounds the destroyed remnant 
of the pre-Collapse starport. The Royal Aircraft Company has 
created a new starport, little more than  a bare patch of dirt, 
it does possess a well and pumping station to provide unrefined 
fuel to visiting starships.  The company also runs balloon and  
dirigible flights across the planet.  The dirigibles are steam 
powered and quite distinctive.  To the few tourists who come to 
the world, they are quaint  retrotech vehicles; to the natives 
they are the most advanced means of getting from here to there.  
About two-thirds of the planetary population lives in Elan Diego, 
the rest are mainly farmers in the surrounding territory.  <P>

There are about 3000 "under-employed" in the city of Elan Diego 
They work gardening and salvaging materials from the city ruins 
with primitive home-made hand tools.  This accounts for about 90% 
of Phoebus's material inputs but only a tiny fraction of its 
agricultural output.  The rest of the materials input comes from 
a few very small mines and some timber cutting just outside the 
city, which are run professionally.  <P>

The Phoebans are out of arable land around the city.  All of the 
coastal and mountain areas are being cultivated or used for 
durga farms and the intervening hill and canyon country is too 
rugged to be worth farming.  The mountains could be more 
intensively cultivated by adding laborers, but this is the only 
area for agricultural expansion since all the land is already 
being used.  <P>

Even working every available acre of the country-side as well as 
all the free patches of ground in the city, the Phoeban laborers 
do not eat well.  Their diet consists principally of the bland 
native tubers, rough grains grown in the coastal flatlands, and 
durga-milk cheese made in the mountains.  Most often the cheese 
is made into a thin  curd-type food, to minimize the effort in 
producing it, and  to make it more filling than solid cheese.  
Feeding the population with dairy products becomes very difficult 
in the summer when  high temperatures increase the risk of 
spoilage during transport.   These staple foods are supplemented 
with small amounts of  durga meat, fresh during the autumn 
slaughter and dried or salted the  rest of the year.  The 
Citizens eat somewhat better, with fresh milk from their private 
animals, a wider array of vegetables from their gardens,  and 
more meat.  The staples of their diet, however, remain the same 
as  the laborers.<P>

More laborers are not used to increase output in the mountain 
durga pastures because of the lack of adequate housing.  The 
harsh winter and summer weather of Phoebus make proper housing a 
life-and-death issue.  Workers are imported from the city during 
the spring birthing season and the autumn slaughter of adolescent 
males.  (Males do not give milk, and only a few are needed for 
breeding so the rest are slaughtered fairly young before the meat 
becomes inedibly tough.)  The temporary workers endure miserable 
conditions in tents, but are needed to get the work done.  <P>

Housing is one of the planet's biggest problems.  Since the 
Collapse, the population has been living in the remaining 
buildings in the city.  Even with the massive population drop 
since the Collapse, the devastation from that period and the 
intervening years of decay have left very few habitable 
buildings. There simply are not enough Phoeban construction 
crews to maintain all of the old city's buildings.  The housing 
situation in the capital has stabilized around the communal 
living buildings, with the scant excess resources being devoted 
to building more permanent housing in the mountains.  This 
currently amounts to housing for  only one additional worker per 
month.<P>

As pressing as the housing problem is, the Council of Citizens  
has determined that the best solution to Phoebus' problems is to 
develop the  planet's industrial base, even if that means not 
being able to improve  the housing situation in the short-term.  
The disgruntled among the  Phoeban laborers complain that this is 
because the Citizens all live in  their own homes, but most 
laborers trust the plans of the Citizens.  They feel that the 
Citizens have succeeded in keeping them feed and housed so far, 
and they are willing to trust them for the future.  In  practice, 
this means that the Citizen farmers are providing food for the  
Citizen industrialists' workers and miners with the promise of 
later  repayment in industrial goods and housing.  The goal is 
to reach the point that such a settlement could be equipped.  
With  continual industrial reinvestment and help from the RC, 
this should be  possible in less than a decade.<P>

<H3>Blacksmith's Daughter</H3>
The Blacksmith's Daughter is one the finest restaurant on 
Phoebus. This ranking is helped somewhat by the fact that there 
are only two restaurants  on Phoebus and the other, the Taproom, 
is a low class dive.  The Blacksmith's Daughter mainly caters to 
the few offworlders who come to Phoebus.  Phoebus is becoming a 
crossroads of the Coalition, but most of these ships refuel at 
the gas giant and proceed on their way.  Occasionally, however, a 
ship  does have to land for supplies, or for an emergency. <P>

The Daughter serves a variety of native foods.  The chef, Tona 
Flenta has created several unique ways of preparing durga which 
are quite tasty. The restaurant has a sizable garden and it grows 
many offworld fruits and vegetables.  Local hunters provide 
several different types of fresh game that Flenta prepares.  <P>

The Daughter is a large prewar mansion of that survived the 
Collapse in remarkable shape. The dining room continues to serve 
as the dining room of the restaurant, and several other 
downstairs rooms are available as private dining rooms.  The 
upstairs has been turned into an inn.  The Blacksmith's Daughter 
has 20 rooms for rent.  Power is supplied by a small water wheel 
that turns a generator.  This supplies enough power to light 
electric light bulbs, which must be imported from off world.  <P>

The Daughter is owned and operated by Hsing Hsu Jones. For those 
guests who want to see a bit more of the planet, Jones organizes 
hiking and hunting trips to the Irontooth mountains, as well as 
the occasional deep-sea fishing trip.  Many visiting ship's 
crewmen have been able to boast of  catching a 
(NAME OF the BIG FISHY BEAST).  Jones has also found that during 
the winter the Ironfoot Mountains offer some very good skiing.  
He tries to organize a ski trip once every 30 days during the 
winter.  He would like to buy a small chairlift from offworld and 
build a small ski lodge, but he does not have enough money right 
now, so he is looking for an offworld investor.  <P>

<HR>

<A NAME="SOCIETY"><H3>SOCIETY</H3></A>

Society on Phoebus is divided along class lines. About ten 
percent of the populace are Citizens, and  thus members of the 
Council of Citizens. Citizenship is based on hereditary, but both 
parents must be citizens for the distinction to pass to their 
children.  Citizens usually strongly discourage their children 
from marrying non-citizens for this reason.  The Council can vote 
on a simple majority to grant citizenship to a non-citizen.  This 
is usually only done when the non-citizen performs a significant 
service to the planet or the Council.  The rest of the population 
either works on the manors that the Citizens run, or are 
unemployed and live in the ruins of the city.  <P>

The Citizens rule the planet, with little input from the masses. 
This is not to say that the non-citizens are slaves of the 
Citizens.  The Citizens feel a genuine obligation to the masses.  
They are raised from birth to recognize their duty to care and 
provide for the non-citizens.  It is because of this sense of 
obligation that the Council of Citizens organizes the 
distribution of food to the unemployed urban dwellers.  They 
organize kitchens that provide durga stew and durga curd cheese 
to the unemployed.  They do not just feed the unemployed; they 
also fund the construction of public works to entertain the 
non-citizens.   The most impressive is the massive public bath 
facility in downtown Elan Diego.  It is made of freshly quarried 
marble, and decorated with relief carvings of the history of the 
planet.  The baths can hold almost five hundred people at once.  
It is a favorite gathering place to relax, and whittle away the 
day.  The baths took over twenty years to construct and are the 
pride of all Phoebans.  Offworld cynics  claim that the Citizens 
offer these tokens to keep the masses from uprising, and that the 
only reason they created a public bath, is because they were sick 
of smelling the unwashed masses.  <P>

The Citizens also produce plays that are performed roughly every 
ten days. The plays often have a political moral, that promotes 
the status quo. Since the resumption of interstellar contact, 
the Council of Citizens has occasionally hired offworlder play 
companies to tour the area. Since Phoebus does not have a great 
deal of surplus funds, the off world acts they do manage to get 
are often second rate, but the non-citizens do not mind, just the 
chance to see offworlders is exciting.  Acts featuring exotic  
animals are very popular.  <P>

The Council of Citizens is lead by the Lord Regent who is holding 
the planet while the subsector duke is unavailable.  Unfortunately 
the subsector duke  and the entire feudal system was destroyed in 
the Collapse, but the people on Phoebus, have not bothered to 
change their government to suit the present. The Council holds 
monthly meetings at which they vote on issues brought to their 
attention by the Lord Regent.  Lord Delvin Garrett is the ruling 
lord regent; he lives in Stonecurtain Keep.  It is not the 
primitive building that it sounds like, but rather an impressive 
a pre-collapse mansion.<P>

Citizens live in large manor houses, while employed non-citizens 
live in large communal housing near the manor.  The more 
unfortunate unemployed live in shanties constructed of materials 
salvaged from the remains of the city. The large communal housing  
was originally pre-collapse warehouses.  Few other antebellum 
buildings survived the collapse.  The warehouses have been 
subdivided into smaller compartments with makeshift partitions, 
and crude walls.  Privacy is very rare in the communal houses.  
This is not to say life is miserable, the non-citizens have 
adapted to the lack of privacy, and have formed large pseudo 
families.  All adults in a given building share in the upbringing 
of the children, and there is always someone to talk to, or lend 
a helping hand. Some outsiders have suggested that given a few 
hundred years the non citizens would have degenerated into a 
primitive tribal society.<P>

Life in the Manor houses is much more what outsiders find to be 
normal.  Each Manor is occupied by an individual family, each 
focusing on an industry.  Most Manor�s are involved in agriculture, 
but some are involved with light manufacturing, such as wagon 
making, woodworking, etc. The citizens organize the non-citizens 
into work details, and in general are the bosses. <P>

While it appears on the surface that the Citizens live a life of 
leisure while the non-citizens toil away, in actuality the 
citizens do not live that much better than the non-citizens.  
They do live in private dwellings, get more flavorful food, and 
are able to afford cloth garments, but there simply is not enough 
surplus capital to provide large amounts of luxury goods.  The 
Citizens also work much harder than the non-citizens.  The 
non-citizens are content with the arrangement, and resent 
offworlders telling them that they should change things.<P>

<HR>

<A NAME="POLITICS"><H3>POLITICS</H3></A>

Phoebus is the most conservative world in the Coalition.  The 
Council of Citizens believes that most of the resources of the 
RC, should be focused on developing its member states, rather 
than rushing off into the Wilds. <P>

Phoebus maintains a small military force of about 300 soldiers. 
Most of  the soldiers are armed with polearms and muskets.  The 
Army has two platoons of durga cavalry. The durga are not very 
quick, and they are slow to accelerate, but once they get moving, 
they are hard to stop.  The durgas are also trained to put its 
cavernous maw to good use. Like every other Coalition world, 
Phoebus makes some contribution to the RC military, in their case 
they have sent a contingent of military cooks.  They are 
currently serving at the Marine training grounds on Aubaine. <P>

    Since there are no enemy nations to fight against, the Phoeban military
primarily serves to protect the planet against raiders from the stars.  
At least that is what they claim, but in reality, they would be hard pressed
to fight against a high tech opponent, but no such opponent has ever attacked
and with the formation of the Coalition, it is unlikely one ever will.
The military does keep busy, acting as a search and rescue force, scouting
out the territory and marking potential hazards such as landslides, avalanche
zones, etc. They also act as the planets police force, arresting lawbreakers
and usually sentencing them to hard labor.  There isn't much crime, there 
isn't much worth stealing, most crimes are crimes of passion, and hardly
ever result in death.  <P>

     The durga calvary platoons are the elite units of the Phoeban military.
The troops are chosen from the children of citizens. The platoons were 
created in 1135, soon after the collapse.  While the units have never seen
combat, they continue to train.  They train their mounts to ride in 
precision formations, and often put on shows in Elan Diego for the Workers.
Historically the troopers have been equipped with muskets, lances, and 
sabers.  The government has recently purchased several cases of the RC
7mm ACR (pg 60 RCEG) from Oriflamme.  The troopers still train with their
muskets; the Citizens do want a back up in case supplies from Oriflamme are 
cut off, for what ever reasons.  The units have also had offers to travel
to other worlds of the Coalition, to perform.  The Reformation Coalition
Service Bureaucracy likes the idea, as it will increase cultural awareness
between the worlds of the RC. In addition it will bring in some hard currency
to the planet allowing them to purchase offworld products.  Another reason
is that it will allow the troops to experience advanced technology
This will help the planet develop in the long run, as more and
more people see the benefits of technological development, they will want
to make the necessary sacrifices to achieve it.  Or so the ivory tower
bureaucrats think, time will tell.<P>
