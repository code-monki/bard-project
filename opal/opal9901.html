 <H1> Jumpstart Caches  </H1>

The Jumpstart caches are divided into two categories. Major caches were established
under the auspices of the 1103 Project Jumpstart, and were designed to
provide a technological leg up to the Imperium in the event of some
unspecified catastrophe. These were large facilities generally colocated
with existing Imperial facilities, containing databases of scientific,
engineering and manufacturing methods, as well as blueprints for crucial
systems like jump drives. These caches were part of a grand scheme, often
requiring a determined planetary effort or interstellar co-operation in
order to gain access.
<P>
Smaller caches were created during the Civil War throughout Strephon's
territory to safeguard specifically against Strephon's fear of an Imperium
breaking down into a Second Long Night of isolated worlds and enclaves,
ravaged by the indiscriminate strikes of the Black War. These caches were
generally located away from major Imperial facilities (them being likely
Black War targets) and were keyed more towards local bootstrapping.

<h3>Sinta Subsector</h3>

<h4>Major Caches</h4>
<B>Inarli</B>    B-677989-D    Pop 4 Billion<BR>
    A High-Pop world with moderate stellar tech and a breathable atmosphere,
Inarli was deemed highly likely to survive in recognisable form in the event
of catastrophe. Lacking a major Imperial base, the cache was planted under
the downport section of the Imperial Starport. Nuclear bombardment by a
Vampire ship in 1131 levelled the starport, rendering the area uninhabitable
for several years and damaging the cache in the process.The cache was
eventually accessed at an unspecified date by a joint Inarli/Tahspeck
effort.
<P>
<h4>Panic Caches</h4>
<B>Sinta</B>    2037    A-201830-D    Pop 300 Million<BR>
    Lacking an atmosphere, Sinta's population inhabited either domed
communities or orbital stations. The orbital starport, co-located with the
2249th Imperial AstRon's home base, was deemed a likely target. Four
subterranean caches were constructed, each containing an unarmed 400 ton
spacecraft, technical databases and the location of a crippled TL-13
Asteroid Monitor set up in the system's asteroid belt as a makeshift cache.
The arrival of Virus to the airless world killed the population off far too
rapidly for any of the caches to be discovered. Since the monitor was shut
down and indeed stripped of many systems, it may well have avoided infection
and even discovery.
<P>
<B>Kloakin</B>    2239    B-572834-9    Pop 200 Million<BR>
    Home to the 2189th Imperial Frontier CruRon, Kloakin was a habitable
world with significant naval facilities. But for the nearby presence of
Inarli, it would have been a good candidate for a proper Jumpstart cache
itself.During the Civil War, a dozen surplus TL-9 SDB hull shells were
quietly sunk in one of the world's small oceans to form a poor copy of a
proper cache. The cache was eventually uncovered by the Brinn, the
technology therein being largely responsible for their rise to TL-9 and the
consequent upgrade of their starport.
<P>
Kateri-Divad 2238 was passed over due to the xenophobic nature of the Brinn.
Not that that eventually stopped them....
Fabeticu 2233 was passed over due to the locals' rejection of technology.
<P>
<h3>Sashrakusha  Subsector</h3>
<P>
<h4>Major Caches</h4>
<B>Dialreck </B>   3036    B-5858CF-6    Pop 700 Million<BR>
    Despite being a fairly low-tech world, Dialreck was selected as the
location for the subsector's primary cache. Located in vaults added onto the
naval base's meson defence network, the main cache was augmented by several
small equipment stores set out in the asteroid belt. Locater hints for this
extensive facility were set on Nart-Roft, Sashrakusha, Wentu-Ruu and several
surrounding worlds. The facility had not been completed at the outbreak of
the civil war, so it was eventually sealed without all the intended contents
having been assembled. Dialreck largely survived Virus, due to its low tech
level and almost total lack of computers. The only place Virus did gain a
foothold was in the naval base, damaged early on by Samson strains, then
taken over by Empire Builders. Fighting between the empire builders revolved
around the base's meson deep sites, which were eventually all destroyed. The
cache probably survived in some form, although it will be difficult and
dangerous to reach. The underground railways will have been heavily damaged,
not to mention the risks from the winning EB.
<P>
<B>Kanorb</B>    2733    C-473976-C    Pop 7 Billion<BR>
    Not host to an Imperial Squadron, but highly populated. Kanorb's cache
was not hidden within an Imperial facility, but rather tunneled deep under
an area used as a training ground by the planetary defence forces. The area
was full of underground facilities - fuel dumps, training areas designed to
simulate meson deep sites or PAD silos, armouries and so on. The cache was
well hidden under an apparently derelict facility and very well sealed. The
location was clued from numerous major libraries, government buildings and
universities oper the planet, but entry would also require codes hidden in
several small facilities scattered over Umaraag and Sumezu, including some
designed to be accessible by Umaraag's Chirper population. With the loss of
interstellar flight, this fact prevented access to the site.
<P>
<B>Above</B>    3232    A-726886-E    Pop 400 Million<BR>
    Concealed within the system's substantial navy base, this cache was much
smaller than either the other two in the system. It contained the
technological databases and navigational instructions for the subsector's
other caches, but no artefacts. Above's destruction during Collapse leaves
the fate of this cache unknown.
<P>
<h4>Panic Caches</h4>
<B>Nart-Roft</B>    2735    C-575886-9    Pop 900 Million<BR>
    Nearly a High Pop world, Nart-Roft's habitable biospphere led to
Strephon's planners placing an uplift cache there. Several small
subterranean or submerged bases were constructed, each requiring codes from
others in order to be unsealed. Nart-Roft's balkanised post-collapse nature
subverted their purpose, as nations refused to share codes with one another,
fearful that others would uncover a high-tech weapons dump. Some caches were
destroyed in military strikes to deny them to other nations, and none were
ever properly unsealed.
<P>
<B>Sintoshee</B>    2640    E-656779-4    Pop 70 Million<BR>
    Three uplift caches were constructed here late in the civil war.
Sintoshee was a low tech world, unable to use jump drive blueprints, so
while thecaches retained the databases and blueprints, they also included
moderately sized caches of tools, supplies and vehicles, including aircraft.
It was no coincidence that the three major warlords dominating Sintoshee's
surviving population were the three to sieze control of these caches. Oops.
