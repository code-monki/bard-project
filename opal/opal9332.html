This world is one of a handful in the subsector that
retains its original feminine name. Daphne was one of
the first Corridor worlds settled, and even had
several Zhodani settlements as late as the 900s. The
world is a pleasant tropical system and a florid
abundance of native life.  Chondol era farmers
discovered that local soils were very suitable for a
number of non-native crops, and the world was settled
as a breadbasket world in the 650s.
<P>
Daphne, along with <a href="opal9330.html">Milne</A>, constituted as the
residences for most of the Avalar Consulates upper
managerial and ownership classes. Daphne is more
earthlike than Milne, and much warmer too. Originally
the world was settled for "hothouse" agriculture, the
raising of warm weather or tropic loving farm products
for consumption by the Consulates rapidly expanding
population. The world retains its for-profit nature,
but the original yeoman farmers have been replaced by
the estates of wealthy and powerful government and
corporate officials, and most of the original
population works as servants, laborers and technicians
in the households and automated farms.
<P>
Aside from the starports and their adjacent free
cities, the world is divided between hundreds of
private estates and corporate enclaves. The local
government is a bureaucracy primarily concerned with
protecting the privacy of these enclaves, and is very
zealous in its persecution of uninvited offworlders
and trespassers.  Most of the planets surface is
off-limits to ordinary citizens, and free movement is
restricted to a handful of free access corridors.
Entry to an estate is by either invitation or a
security pass obtained through the Territorial Police
Service, pending approval from the estate in question.
<P>
In addition to the TPS, a heavy presence of government
and private security forces protects the estates
proper, and the local consensus is that it is
preferable to be caught by the local police than to
being roughed up by the latter.  Most of these
supplementary forces are drawn from the Consulates
various elite police forces, either directly, or
recruited from retired police and military personnel
in the case of private forces.
<P>
Most estates are permitted heavy weapons to enforce
the sanctity of their privacy, and attempts to
forcibly penetrate security will certainly elicit a
devastating response from local forces.  Daphne's
airspace is restricted to prevent intrusion from
space, and in some areas space defense forces and SDBs
enforce the rules with shoot-to-kill orders.
<P>
Rumors have abounded for centuries that Daphne's
security had permitted the Zhodani and Avalar
intelligence services to establish several top secret
facilities in the more remote parts of the world, and
that many of these are still in operation.  Most
rumors hint that these facilities were for training of
elite military units, Pro-Zhodani guerillas, espionage
psionics.  It is also claimed that a number of
emergency weapon caches were constructed as a backstop
against Imperial advances into Foreven, or
anti-Zhodani agitation within Avalar itself. Naturally
the veracity of these rumors cannot be reliably
checked.
