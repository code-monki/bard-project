Shiiku is the fifth moon of the gas giant Meshidi. It
is the only habitable body in its system, which isn't
saying much. The world is a sunbaked desert, and
radiation storms from Meshidi sometimes leak through
the thin atmosphere. And its elliptical orbit brings
it close to a disintegrating moon closer in, breaking
off debris that pummels the world. Why anyone chose to
inhabit this world has been lost to history, literally
as a previous regime destroyed the original colony
records in a fit of exorcistical violence about three
hundred years ago.
<P>
Shiiku has few resources, and its people subsist on
cave grown fungus and water extracted traps from the
fogbanks that collect in the cool early morning air.
The lives of the local citizenry have always been
wretched, as they have enjoyed an unending sucession
of oppressive and sometimes incompetent leadership.
The local tech level is limited by the impoverished
economy, and the government and its security forces
get first pick of imported goods, giving the public
hand me downs and secondhand machinery and vehicles.
Civilian movement was heavily regulated and
supervised, and offworld movement was usually
prohibited.<P>

In 1162 the population revolted against the ruling
strongman and his unpopular rule, and millions fled
the world in the bloody aftermath. Fearful of losing
power, the government has slowly begun to loosen its
grip, though the lack of jobs and general
dissatisfaction make this a risky venture at best. The
RISS base commander has stepped in as a mediator, and
is attempting to bring in outside commercial groups to
invest in and employ the local population. The lack of
viable resources and the uneducated population will
likely make liberalisation and mainstreaming of this
world a long and drawn out process even if enough
offworld interest is generated.
