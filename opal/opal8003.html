<p>Home to nearly half the Confederation's total population, Stonehaven has been a driving force in the sub-sector's emergence from the collapse for nearly two decades.

<p>Stonehaven was fortunate enough to receive a cryptic message from Admiral Iilikan Azora which allowed them to make the emergency preparations necessary to survive the collapse.  Data-links were cut, vital information was purged and communication systems were destroyed.  Unfortunately the dark-side to this miracle is the half million people left behind to face the wrath of virus.  Most of these people were either killed out right or enslaved.

<p>With surface pressures reaching close to eighty atmospheres at sea level, only specially designed equipment was capable of surviving the trip from the mountain top starports to the ocean, machines which had been either destroyed or removed long before virus infected the planet's data net.  This allowed the more fifty underwater and shore side "Deep Cities" to survive the collapse relatively intact.

<p>However, as time wore on it became increasingly apparent that Virus was not about to simply move on, ignoring the human populace that lay just beyond it's grasp and so it came to pass that a well organized human resistance was formed in these cities striking back at the technological terrors that spread destruction from their mountain top fortresses.  As the resistance gathered information about their foes it became apparent that Stonehaven was not merely occupied by the forces of Virus it was quite possibly one of the strongest staging posts on this side of the Imperium.  Dozens of vampire ships called Stonehaven home and hundreds more used the planet as a repair and re-supply point.

<p>In the summer of 1183 members of the human resistance stumbled upon the coordinates of the "McAllister Meson Deep-site" and the fate of the planet changed.  Training began in earnest and by the summer of the following year four system defense boats and over one hundred thousand troops lay waiting for the signal, a signal that came at 08:37, 251-1184.

<p>Unprepared for such a massive onslaught, viral resistance collapsed within a matter of days and before the month was over the entire system had been cleared.  Twelve thousand five hundred humans gave their lives in those few short days, more than one in ten.  Casualties were highest amongst the noble units, closer to sixty percent.  Upon later evaluation it was determined that the noble units were not only poorly trained and poorly equipped they were also volunteered to areas far beyond their combat capability.  It would come the spell the death for the last vestiges of Stonehaven Nobility.  With the nobility's downfall Stonehaven began to rebuild and once again reach out to the stars.

<p>In 1201 Stonehaven has become a very different world, after decades of struggling to liberate three systems from the control of Virus, the people of Stonehaven finally feel that they have achieved a certain degree of safety and with the creation of the Confederation there are newer challenges to face, both closer to home and further afield.

<p>Closer to home, Stonehaven teeters on the edge of achieving TL12 status.  While capable of producing most systems at TL12, Stonehaven is unfortunately incapable of breaking though the TL12 barrier at present due to it's inability to fabricate TL12 Jump Drives.  Stonehaven is truly the industrial heart of the Confederation, nearly ninety-five percent of all finished goods produced by the Confederation originate on Stonehaven and one-hundred percent of the Confederation's weapon's and starship construction facilities are based on the planet.  This industrial / non-industrial dichotomy has led to some of the Confederation's most heated disagreements.

<p>Further afield Stonehaven faces the very real threat of retaliation from the wilds and a continued vampire threat.  To this end Stonehaven's system defense force maintains more warships and SDB's than the remainder of the Confederation Naval Arms combined.<p>
