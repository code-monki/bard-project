Estyske was a mini-depot for the Avalar Navy in
antebellum times.  While not as important as <a href="opal9322.html">Tapsa-64</A>
for combined military operations with the Zhodani, the
local depot was necessary for the maintenance and
repair of the Avalars own naval vessels.  As a result
of this concentration, most of the local industry was
rather sophisticated.
<P>
The original depot, and eighty percent of Estyske's
population, resides in a large impact basin.  The
depot was constructed around the central rebound
spike, and the community and vital facilities and
factories in a radiating ring of communities that
reaches out to the walls of the basin. The remainder
of the population lives in other nearby basins
surrounding the main basin, working mines or tending
hydroponic gardens. Sixty percent of the local
industry is oriented towards the base, and much of the
remainder is high-tech industry that sprang from that
original contact.
<P>
Since 1140, Estyske has seen a massive influx of
Regency immigrants, mostly older high-tech workers
displaced on their original homeworlds by the rapid
advancement of the Regency's tech level.  While these
workers no longer have the skills or knowledge to
survive in the Regency's emerging TL-16 society, there
more than good enough for the Avalar Consulate.  These
migrants and their descendants are common throughout
the Avalar Corridor, but only on Estyske do they make
up a near majority (49.7%) of the population.  As such
Estyske feels more like an Imperial world than an
Avalar one.  These migrants have been even more easily
angered to provoked by the Consulates traditional
reliance upon repressive policing and legal policies
than their fellows, and have taken an active interest
in local politics, especially in the wake of the
Consulates attempt in the 1180s to disenfrancise them.
<P>
Estyske's tech level is actually a borderline 15, and
will probably be relisted in another five years.  The
immigrants, for all of their thorniness with the local
authorities, have begun to fulfill the twin promises
of the immigration program: technological and
commercial integration with the Regency, and the slow
but sure creation of a middle class to break up the
monotony of the traditional Zhodani inspired social
structure.
<P>
It is also worth noting that Estyske has probably the
best cuisine in all of Foreven.
