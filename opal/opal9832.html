The local
dictatorship was fearful of allowing the
Representational Reforms to occur on Attee. But at the
same time it managed to convince itself that it could
ignore that they even existed by somehow isolating its
subjects from it popular appeal. Attee's police and
security services stamped out reform movements, and
liberalism was stillborn. But Attee's rulers failed to
take into account the existence of the Escape Clause.
With the removal of the extrality zone around their
main downport, hundreds of millions of local citizens
have simply walked off the world, leaving a planet
filled with abandoned settlements and a failing
economy.

<P>
Today, only 10
percent of its population remains, the result of
massive offworld emigration to Gazulin and Tobia. The
surface of the world is dotted with abandoned
communities, and these are visited by frequent
military patrols to keep out renewed Fteirle
intrusion.
