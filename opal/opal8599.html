Giranima is covered in thick tropical jungles, as most
of its continents are near the equator. Huge trees up
to 100 meters tall shroud the more well watered
regions, concealing some of the most diverse
ecosystems in Deneb. The world possesses an axial tilt
of exactly 7 degrees, allowing for little seasonal
variation and long growing seasons.
<P>
The original colonists were a mixture of farmers and
oceanic miners who came here starting around 130. The
dense forests and poor soils slowed dry land
habitation to a crawl, though coastal cities built to
support seafloor dredging operations grew quickly.
This dichotomy is still evident today, with well
developed cities seperated by vast tracts of empty
wilderness. As on the almost identical world of
Noghon, most food is raised at sea, though mostly
these are grown in lagoons and tanks built inside the
cities themselves.
<P>
Like Noghon as well, Giranima was heavily influenced
by a more powerful neighbor, in this case Lilad. The
oligarchic government pumped money and influence in
into the local economy, virtually taking control of
its markets and government. After a coup d'e tat in
635, the current oligarchic council, almost identical
in format and organisation as Lilads', came to power
and has ruled ever since. Unlike her patron, the
Giranima oligarchs are much more fair and benevolent,
and resistance to its rule has been muted. For
centuries its economy was subordinated to Lilads, but
that dependence was broken by its inclusion into the
IDP, and the world is now economicially independent.
Centuries of industrial pollution that resulted from
Lilad's imported heavy industry will take centuries to
remove or remediate.
<P>
The biggest threat to the world's progress had been a
loose alliance of rebel insurgencies, leftover from
the Crucible period, that have attempted to overthrow
the government because of its 'undemocratic'
practices. These groups are only loosely allied, and
their expertise is doubtful, and are considered
laughingstocks by offworlders because of past
mistakes, blunders and miscalculations. The group has
no central command or name, but offworld media has
labeled them the Giranima Alliance of Freedom Fighting
Entities, or GAFFE.
