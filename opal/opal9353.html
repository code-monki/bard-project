The Mahir system is the crown jewel of the Torinsk
cluster. Both of its gas giants are adjacent to
sizeable and rich asteroid belts, and a number of
their moons are littered with nickel-iron debris from
past collisions. The innermost belt is one of the
largest (around 2.0 AUs in extent) in all of Foreven.
<P>
Mahir itself is a glittering jet-black rock in orbit
around Mojave, the systems outermost gas giant. The
world is bitterly cold, and what atmosphere it does
have is a result of sublimative venting of CO2 and
water vapor on the sunlighted side. The ground is a
cement-hard mixture of water ice, CO2 and meteoric
debris, that is difficult to break up with normal
mechanical means. Gravitational flexing by Mojave
causes faulting and rifting, that result in icequakes
and occasional, explosive fumaroles of heated water
and gas.  The surface is heavily cratered, and in some
areas seepage and subsidence has created deep ice
caverns. Most of the mainworld's settlements are built
on the surface as a result.
<P>
Mahir's mineral wealth attracted itinerant Zhodani
belters as early as -500, but its distance was a
deterrence to settlement. <a href="opal9352.html">Nesturgian</A> traders
established a trading camp in the wake of their
starflight revival, but abandoned the facility in
-116 as a result of disenchantment with interstellar
contact. It wasn't until the late 270s that a
permanent presence was established, in the form of
naval units from an expansionistic <a href="opal9351.html">Xenough</A>. Xenough
limited access to the system to its own belters and
Syndicrate enterprises, and in 302 annexed the system
outright. Tensions with the Zhodani led to increasing
fortification of it and neighboring Torinsk, and this
culminated in the establishment of a permanent
settlement in 345.
<P>
Mahir was a major objective in skirmishes and battles
between Xenough and both the Zhodani and the Avalars.
The latter particulary coveted the system, both for
its mineral wealth, and as a means of knocking Xenough
off of its legs, economically. A major Avalar
offensive in the last Xenough War damaged if not
destroyed nearly every artificial structure in the
system, but the Syndari garrison held out until relief
forces repulsed the attackers. As a result of the
wars, the entire Torinsk cluster became heavily
fortified, and those fortifications remain in place to
this day, even though their focus and intended purpose
is still primarily to deter military aggression by
fellow Avalar member-worlds.
<P>
Fortification, however, is a relative thing. Because
of the extent of Mahir's resource regions, most
colonies and settlements were scattered across both
belts and nearly every moon. As such linear or
strongpoint defenses proved worthless against
determined Avalar siege forces, who would simply
concentrate their forces against vulnerable
settlements, and take the system incrementally.  To
retaliate against such attacks, the system became one
vast armory. Each community has a large portion of its
population (usually Poilu laborers) trained and
equipped as militia. Equippage depends upon the size
of the settlement, with rude vacuum mining camps
simply armed with small-arms and maybe grenades and
light anti-tank weapons, and large cities defended by
armed small craft, PADs, converted SDBs and even
dual-purpose fighter/shuttles.  Each militia lager is
under heavy supervision by the local security
services, and to limit temptation, civilian movement
in the system is controlled and monitored.
<P>
As a condition of the armistice that brought Xenough
and the rest of the Torinsk cluster into the Avalar
Consulate, each of Xenough's colonies recieved nominal
independence from their motherworld. In practice,
though, the local governments defer on policy matters
to the central Syndicrate. Mahir's government is
dominated by the local Securicrate police and their
paramilitary cadres, and are dominated by the Rakhmani
and Syndari caste. The Securicrate run the system in a
paranoid and secretive manner, and the other castes
are under heavy surveillance nearly all of the time.
Spies and bugging are present everywhere, and
"sedition" (an all-encompassing category on Mahir)
will usually get an offender a long vacation at labor
camps scattered around the system.
<P>
Offworlders should be cautious about travel insystem.
Vessels without the necessary transponders and permits
are permitted to travel to the main highport only, and
are not permitted to engage in frontier refueling.
Vessels without clearance caught travelling in other
parts of the system are immediately seized by local
SDBs, their crews imprisoned in labor camps, and the
offending vessel confiscated. However, to be caught by
the local naval patrols is preferrable to local
militia units: most militias take a "no questions
asked, no hard feelings afterwards" philosophy about
interloping vessels, and they will fire without
hesitation.
