Capital of the Old Expanses sector. Galines was formerly the capital of the
Twenty-One Worlds Empire during the Long Night, and was one of the first
planets in the sector to become a member of the Third Imperium. Its
astrographical position and planetary characteristics also make it an
ideal capital.
<P>
Just prior to the Rebellion, and the Solomani retaking their portions of the
sector, the capital was moved to Vaward (1106 Old Expanses). Margaret's
staff had influenced the Domain of Sol to move numerous Domain-level
functions to Vaward for various reasons, which turned out fortunate for
their faction later on. This explains the relative ease of the quick
relocation from Galiano when it was needed. Note also that Duke Galiano
retains all original heraldly and titles, without Vaward references.
