In antebellum times, Qi'ire was a neutral buffer zone
world situated between the Third Imperium and the
Vargr Extents. Its human population was a diverse and
fractious lot, and was broken into small family sized
collectives. The population subsisted on trade between
the Imperium and the Vargr, maintaining and servicing
the ships, and entertaining the crews that used their
port as a transit point. Many of the collectives were
commercial concerns, with families competing for
business contracts in areas like hospitality,
maintenance, security and administration. Though the
competition was fierce, it was restrained by a common
legal code shared by each group, and the starport and
its environs was considered to be communal property.
<P>
The Civil War standoff between the Domain of Deneb and
the Assemblage of 1116 caused border trade to shrivel
up completely, and Qi'ire felt this economic pain.
Though not Pro-Imperial, the severity of Vargr corsair
raids forced it to rely heavily upon DoD naval patrols
to protect it. Virus and the subsequent Collapse were
even less kind; the newly declared Regency established
its Frontier borders in a way that left the world just
outside in the Wilds. About fifty percent of the
population had evacuated, due to both the Vargr and
Virus, and the remaining population consolidated their
technology and infrastructure the best that they
could.
<P>
Today the world is a valuable oasis for free traders
wandering in the desert of the Wilds. Despite a major
tech drop, the world's proximity to the Regency
permitted it to keep it from dropping too low, and
local maintenance crews can still do ship maintenance
in their nearly immaculate starport. The world has
been left nearly unscathed by Vampire attacks, the
result of strong Regency naval patrols in this vital
chokepoint system. The locals have regressed their
government and law level to reflect the harshness of
their environment, but remain strongly committed to
each other and their general survival.
<P>
To maintain their morale, and solidify their
solidarity, the locals put on a carnival every two
local years. This is less of a celebration in the
traditional sense than a time of feasting, serious
discussion and relaxation. Family elders discuss
business, politics and security over heaping plates
and large amounts of alcohol. Marriages are arranged,
personal relationships are explored or cemented, and
offworld diplomacy is handled. Free traders and other
offworld crews are treated as honored guests, and are
importuned into joining these festivities. Many
offworld parties use the festival to handle their own
business or to cement major transactions. Some free
trade collectives use it to time reunions of their
scattered vessels and crews, who convene to show off
and trade their accumulated wares.
