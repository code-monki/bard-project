This funny world with a Vilani name is a far flung
colony settled from Vland in the early 400s. The
colonists were mostly Vilani disenchanted with the
young Third Imperium, and who migrated here with the
same, mostly Solomani wave that settled the Borderland
and other now predominantly human regions of Trojan
Reach.  Gikarlum is very traditional, all aspects of
Vilani culture are enforced by the bureaucratic
government, which is itself divided into the
traditional three bureax system.  The world is not a
popular place for crews from either the Regency or the
Aslan to visit, as the local authorities are not very
keen on turning their world into a watering hole for
either, and keep the amenities that attract offworld
spacers to a minimum.
