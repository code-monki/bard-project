Name is French, meaning "Etoile's Sand."  Sable des
Etoiles is one of five worlds settled by French
Solomani known as the Marseilles cluster. This was
part of the same group that settled the Federation of
Garrone in neighboring Beyond Sector.

 <P>
When first contacted by the Third Imperium in 69, the
five worlds were all part of a small interstellar
state known as the Strend Pact, which possessed TL-12
and a small fleet of starships. The Pact was governed
by the oppressive Destiny Directorate, the predecessor
of the Strends current Rational Destiny movement.

 <P>
It espoused (and continues to espouse on Strend) a
strange mixture of ecstatic Catholicism and poorly
understood Cartesian philosophy. It held that humanity
once existed in an edenic state under a deistic god,
but had been expelled from paradise by the fall of
Adam, and was consigned to a hellish animal state as a
result. In order for man to be redeemed, he would have
to recognise and retrieve his original rational side
through severe self-examination, clean living and
strict obedience to laws of reason.  Those that were
most successful than others at redisovering their
rational purity were declared to be "evolved" and were
placed in the Destiny hiearchy to help their less
fortunate brothers and sisters.

 <P>
Strangely enough the Destiny movement lacked the
secret police or large security apparatuses typical of
totalitarian government. But that was because it
believed that the path to reclaiming this purity lay
through proper nutrition, heavy exercise, ascestic
self-deprivation and even surgical mutilation. As a
result, physicians, nutritionists, surgeons and
calisthenic instructors became the Destiny elite.
Martial arts and physical training were stressed, and
the mastery of the body through athletics and physical
prowess became as important as normal academic
learning.

 <P>
Because of its literal interpretation that redemption
lay through health, Rational Destiny was in many ways
more benevolent than most totalitarian societies. But
it was in many ways more intrusive in its desire to
monitor the health of its citizens, and intolerant of
failure.  People that didn't measure up for whatever
reasons determined by the regime, were exiled to less
amenable worlds for "rehabilitation." Most of these
were sent to Sable des Etoiles.

 <P>
Sable des Etoiles was settled as a resource colony for
Strend, and its "Rehabilitants" were practically
slaves for the oppressive Pact government. They lived
in miserable conditions under heavy military guard,
and were worked like beasts of burden till they died
from exhaustion, accidents or suicide.  The local
military garrison eventually decided to make common
cause with the miners, though purely for reasons of
self-interest. After several years of quiet
preparation, the troops mutinied against the Pact in
256, winning the systems independence. The loss of the
system made it difficult for Strend to replace its
military losses, and the Pact broke up in 260.

 <P>
Alas, the new military regime gave way to a
bureaucracy that reenshrined many of the original
Destiny teachings, and applied to their new subjects,
with much the same severity.  Unlike Strend's Destiny
government, the Sable des Etoiles government is
non-doctrinaire, more concerned with profits from the
systems mines and factories, and only concerned with
individual health where it applies to productivity and
work attendance. While this makes them less intrusive
into private life, it makes them extremely punitive
towards "slackers" and "donkeys" that don't measure
up.

 <P>
Fortunately the regime has shown enough sense to share
enough of the profits with the common people to raise
the standard of living, and therefore avoid widespread
dissension.  While private corporations are banned, a
system of advancement, carried over from the original
Destiny days, uses aptitude and medical testing to
recognise individual potentials in adolescents, and
steer them into appropriate slots within the worlds
well funded Ecole system.

 <P>
With a TL of E, the world exports a number of
industrial products to the Aslan, the Regency and
various Hinter states. The government would like to
eventually upgrade the starport to an A class
facility, and to exploit the Regency's demand for
merchant starships.
