Quirinal has a very complex trinary star arrangement.
The G2 Dwarf is located equidistantly between the
primary star and the M-class far companion, and its
orbit dawdles indecisively between them, taking about
five thousand years to orbit the primary. All three
stars contain their own extensive solar systems,
though most of it are small solitary planetoids and
Kuiper disk material scattered around in elliptical
orbits.<P>

The main world is mostly flat desert. A single hill
like rise is the sole surface relief, and is the
reason the world is named after one of the seven hills
of ancient Rome on Terra. The world has few resources
of its own, and the community has survived mostly by
mining minerals on nearby celestial bodies. A number
of belters make their homes here, and their mining
platforms return to the mainworld, bringing the
harvest for processing. Additional income is generated
by the mines on their colony world of Isidor (Deneb
1436).
<P>
Quirinal's population is rather strange. Most trace
their ancestry to an ancient Solomani ethnic grouping
known as the Romanians, who once lived in the eastern
part of Terra's European continent. Like their
ancestors, the locals (who call themselves Romi) are
superstitious and insular. The local government is a
collection of cabals and secret societies, the
dominant one being called the Calusari, which
apparently has a long history back to early modern
Terra. The group operates in secrecy, and does not
even acknowledge is existence or deal with the
offworld authorities. All normal governmental
operations are carried out by a Supreme Council that
is outwardly democratic, but in fact is riven with
intrigue and ancient rivalries.
