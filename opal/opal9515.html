  <P>
Formerly known as 875-496. Prince Edward was an
accidental colony.  The world is named after an escort
cruiser attached to the Izmir Corporation fleet that
journeyed into the Marches around -1710. While the
fleet was surveying the surrounding region, looking
for a suitable world for settlement, the Prince Edward
was sent on a deep recon mission into Menorial/Trojan
Reach, and crash landed on the world after a misjump.
Listed as missing and having crashed on a remote
world, rescue would have been difficult.  And because
of the fleet's subsequent contact and settlement of
Daryen, no rescue mission ever found them.
 <P>
The survivor's descendants were eventually recontacted
about a century later, and the Confederacy established
a development mission on the world to uplift it back
into the Daryen mainstream.  But the Maghiz cut short
that project, and the Confederacy had to concentrate
upon rebuilding its homeworlds. As Prince Edward was
primarily Turkish with few Daryen influences, the loss
of contact was less harmful to them than it was for
other Daryen colonies.
 <P>
When the expanding Third Imperium began expanding into
District 267, the IISS interdicted the world, placing
it firmly under uncontested Imperial control. Because
of its non-Imperial culture, the world lay in limbo
for most of the Imperial era, as authorities were
unsure about its disposition towards being assimilated
into the Imperium. The interdiction was lifted in 885,
and a scout base was established to keep in contact
with the locals, and eventually bring them into the
Imperium as a full member world.
 <P>
The Prince Edwardians are a well organised and
cohesive bunch.  Their adopted homeworld's mild
weather and plentiful food supply prevented
intercommunal fighting and strife from developing, and
created a tolerant if somewhat wary society. The
colony never exceeded more than 40,000 people, and the
need for fresh genetic material made them hospitable
towards those ship crews and travellers that made
their way off of the beaten path to their world.
However the colony remained true to its original
culture, in spite of the IISS contact personnels best
efforts, and the world remained on the fringes of
Imperial development policy.
 <P>
After the Collapse, the new Regency reversed many
dogmatic and cynical Imperial policies, especially its
crony-based economic and development practices. The
ecological umbrella group known as NEO recieved
permission to settle Five Sisters underdeveloped
worlds with indigenous human populations, including
Prince Edward, under the condition that they uplifted
the local populations with as little pain or
exploitation as possible.
 <P>
Despite some early tensions, the Edwardians grudgingly
accepted this new colonisation, and eventually warmed
up to their new neighbors. Culturally the world is an
eclectic mix, with even a few Darrians, who immigrated
in the 1170s, thrown in for good measure.  While
technological development has been slow, it has a wide
range of amenities, and its mild plenty has
discouraged widespread dissemination of unnecessary
high-tech anyway.  The world is now a full member of
the Regency, and its Senate delegation is noteworthy
for championing liberal policies and challenging older
reactionary groups.
