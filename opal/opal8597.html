Sestos was originally settled to exploit the cheap
abundance of nitrates and ammonium in the atmoshere.
Local industry includes a number of fertiliser and
explosive manufacturers who export to other low-tech
worlds around the Regency. The world is crisscrossed
by huge rifts with depths up to 3 miles, and
earthquakes are a common occurence. The world features
a simple ecosystem of hardy microorganisms that
cluster around volcanic vents deep underground or
underwater. Due to the formation of nitrogen dioxide
and nitrates due to interaction with solar radiation,
the atmosphere is a brown-yellow brown-yellow haze of
low visibility during the daytime. Low temperatures
and the poisonous low oxygen atmosphere require full
vacc suit protection at all times.
<P>
The reason for its balkanisation is rather simple:</B> the
world was colonised in waves by colonists who wanted
nothing to do with the existing communities. Relations
between the various state governments are cool and
distant, and most have their own starports or landing
facilities so they do not have to rely upon each other
for trade. Local atmospheric conditions and the low
prevailing tech level create too many chances for
containment failures due to collateral damage, so
military aggression is universally eschewed; however
this is the only commonly agreed upon protocol. To
compensate for the lack of cooperation, the Imperial
government assigned a common governor to administer
and negotiate among the bickering nations. In
antebellum times only about half of the states were
Imperium members; since the Collapse 14 of the 17 are
a part of the Regency.
