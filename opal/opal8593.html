Tuwayk exists in a system that possesses a high amount
of asteroidal debris. The world itself once orbited
much closer to its primary, but collisions with this
debris pushed it into the habitable zone a scant four
hundred million years ago. Simple Panspermic bacterium
and viruses oppurtunistically settled the lifeless
surface and atmosphere, though no advanced
multicelluar life has yet evolved. Because of its
inner zone genesis, the world has very little water in
its crust and mantle, and most of its surface water
has come by way from subsequent collisions. The
atmosphere is heavily tainted with heavy gases from
recent volcanic eruptions, and is classified as
tainted irritant.
<P>
The world was originally settled as a mining colony,
and in subsequent centuries industrial investment has
slowly built up its manufacturing base. Trade
travelling down the Rift Highway from Deneb to Tobia
eventually replaced mineral extraction as the chief
source of income, and lax local laws made the world
attractive for investors looking for a tax shelter.
Since it became an industrial planet in the
Post-Collapse period, trillions of credits have been
poured from neighboring Beaxon and nearby Lintl and
Tobia into local deposits and accounts. In conjunction
with the Industrial Development Program, this money
has permitted a three point jump in technological
improvement. Services have displaced manufacturing as
the preeminent industries, and most local factories
have been moved to Beaxon to take advantage of the
cheaper labor there.
<P>
Tuwaykers are generally mercantile in their outlook,
and oftentimes downright mercenary in their pursuits
of profits. The local government is a collection of
local corporations and trading cartels that own most
of the local infrastructure and industry outright, but
are recognised by the local charters as individual
citizens. Because of the loose network nature of this
arrangement, mercantile allegiance is often more
important than individual rights. Local politics
resemble an asylum dining hall, with debates often
spilling over into frequent brawls in the popular
assembly, and into full fledged street rioting, often
over very small issues. These brawls actually prevent
the world from being a full fledged oligarchy, as most
of these are fully spontaneous with little
orchestration.
