<h3>Overview</h3> Titan is a searing, hot world that is
nevertheless blessed with the wealth of natural
resources, strategic location, and good fortune that
makes for successful industrial development.  Titan
was once the indisputed technological marvel of the
Avalar Consulate. Despite its inhospitable
environment, or perhaps because of it, the world and
its people were always able to create a balance
between individual creativity and the need for
communal order, and the resulting synthesis propelled
the world's economic and technological success.
<P>
That success hinged greatly on the indispensability of
its heavy industries to the rest of first the Avalar
Union, and later the Consulate.  It also depended
heavily upon the close ties the Titan government
helped foster between with the Zhodani, and the
trickle of trade that the alliance created.  When the
Collapse occured, the shock waves upset the status quo
of the Avalar Consulate, and overturned the delicate
balance that typified Titan and its society.
<P>
<h3>Geology</h3> Titan is primarily hot, dry desert.  The
world seems to have had only a brief period of
tectonic development, and its crust was immobilised
early in its geologic history.  Underplating of the
early crust by geothermal hot spots thickened the
surface, and created massive areas of uplifted crust
that formed dry plateaus and escarpments that scar the
surface of the planet.  Most of the planets
hydrosphere became trapped in huge underground
aquifers, and what remained was evaporated or ran off.
What little surface water the world has is locked up
in large salt rifts located in the world's polar
regions, none of it potable or useable for human
consumption.
<P>
The static nature of the planets crust provided hot
spot volcanism the oppurtunity to emplace massive
deposits of metals, quartz and gemstones within huge
xenocysts, massive voids of mostly homogenous rock,
created by differential heating and cooling.  These
xenocysts can range from the size of a human fist, up
to the size of a large mountain in size.  While this
has given Titan's human population the means for
making a living, the percolation of heated water
through these deposits leached out heavy metals into
much of the local water supply, requiring that it be
extensively filtered before use, an insult in addition
to the injury of living on an arid world.
<P>
The high surface temperature and minor nature of the
world's oceans has also prevented the development of
complex local lifeforms.  Nothing more complicated
than some communal microorganisms have ever been found
in the local biosphere.  Virtually all of that life
lives underground, in the hot, mobile deep crustal
rock.  Despite the inconvenience of its location, a
significant portion of the local microbes are highly
tolerant of the metal-enriched water found in most of
the planets aquifers, and several local species are
utilised in water and air filtration, removing the
impurities that prevent their consumption by humans.
<P>
<h3>Geography</h3> Most of the planets population lives within
massive city-states that divide up the world from the
equator to latitudes 30-35 degrees.  This is mostly
because temperatures are more consistent, with fewer
summer and wintertime extremes in light of the worlds
sizeable axial tilt, and the convection of what little
atmospheric water vapor at the equator allows for some
daytime cooling.
<P>
Most of these city states, comprising two-thirds of
the population, are located in the shadow of the huge
Inyuri Scarp, a massive, 4000 meter high escarpment
that circles eighty percent of Titan's circumference
from East to West at a shallow three degree angle,
about eleven degrees south of the equator. To the
north of the escarpment, a rocky plain dominates
except for an occasional bisecting mountain range.
Here enough water and soil existed to permit
agriculture, and despite its seeming extravagance, a
wide belt of green can be seen from orbit, girdling
the planet.  South of the Inyuri is a trackless,
monotonous sea of ergs, interrupted only by occasional
breaks for broken terrain.
<P>
About three other large scarps also scar the northern
hemisphere, the Jacquin, the Guthardi and the
Kourefen. These too house sizeable populations, but
the lack of potable water limits these communities to
mining and industry, with the Guthardi being a source
for forty percent of the planets iron ore.  The
nothern reaches are mostly sand and dirt, and rough
terrain is rare. Outside of these scarp cities, most
other significant communities are to be found in the
polar regions, mostly supported by extraction
industries.

<h3>History</h3><P>

Titan attracted industrial interest very early in the
Chodlot period, and Zhodani commercial interests were
visiting the world as early as -90.  A small group of
settlements were established in the early years before
the Imperial period, scattered up and down the planets
scarp complexes. In many cases these settlements were
the pioneers for the later mega-cities that would be
built atop of them in later centuries.  The Zhodani
found the world trying to develop, and they could not
attract enough workers or investment money to make the
world flower up to their ambitions.  Nevertheless, a
significant industrial presence was established by the
time the Avalar Consulate was founded, and the planet
was a major source of starships for both the Zhodani
and the youthful Avalar government.
<P>The Zhodani transferred the world to Avalar in 658,
and for a century was under de facto joint governance,
with a council of Zhodani "consultants" advising the
new local government.  The local Zhodani population
was permitted to remain, and most of it was absorbed
in later immigration waves.  This assimilation did not
go uniformly, and cultural mixing was uneven, creating
a number of different cultural groups of varying
Imperial-Solomani-Zhodani descent, that dominated a
particular region or cluster of settlements.  In many
cases the original Zhodani upper classes and nobles
seperated themselves from this mixing with the intent
of remaining culturally transcendant, and retaining
their power and influene in both their homeland and
their adopted residence. These groups were later
supplanted in the late 800s by a new class of upper
class Venues and their retinues, which grafted
themselves upon this Zhodani elite, and excluded
themselves from the general population and its group
politics, but were only to happy to uproot and
distribute them as they saw fit.
<P>
For the most part the upper classes were merely
interested in their own enrichment. The cosmopolitan
attitude of the prevailing Zhodani elite rubbed off on
the emerging Avalaran venues, and they affected a
carpetbaggers attitude, seeing the world as a stepping
stone to power on the much large stage The world and
its population were seen as something to exploit
rather than develop. resentment ran vertically from a
majority, as well as horizontally.  Poverty drove
conflict, and divided the planet along mostly ethnic
lines. Money mostly flowed upwards, and in many cases
the people who enjoyed that prosperity were largely
ignorant of its origin or the conditions that attended
it.  Social chasms within the antebellum Avalar
Consulate as a rule were very, painfully wide, but the
divisions on Titan were extreme and potentially fatal.
<P>

The dislocation of diverse population groups from
established communities, and their relocation into
other ethnic or cultural regions was a sure recipe for
communal violence.  Escalating mini-wars prompted the
establishment of authoritarian military dictatorships,
and harsh crackdowns by police and paramilitary
troops. Colonial and economic competition from the
nearby Torinsk cluster led to an expansion in
industrial projects that created more repression and
hardship. Rebellions among the general population
created an escalating series of crackdowns, including
purges and mass expulsions of conscript, dissident and
prison laborers and pioneers to the new colonies on
Spokes, Evaberi and Pudimon.
<P>
The worst aspect of this repression was the divide et
impera policy of selective priveleges offered to some
cultural groups in return for loyalty.  In many cases
these favors generated more tensions, but mostly it
failed to create any strong support for the regime.
Eventually the governments only bastion of support was
the upper classes, both Avalar and Zhodani. It became
totally isolated from the growing dissatisfaction, and
the world was acknowledged as a powderkeg in the years
before the Fourth Frontier War. A meltdown was allayed
by draconian martial law, the strong support of the
Zhodani government, the economic importance of the
world to the Avalar Consulate, and the weary distrust
that had been sowed by the Titan government among
dissenting groups.
<P>
Had the Collapse not intervened, and the linkage
between Avalar and the Zhodani been a casualty, it is
likely that balkanisation would have been staved off
indefinitely.  Instead, the Zhodani Chill in the 1140s
precipitated the downfall of Titan's powerful Zhodani
population in importance, and removed one of the main
legs propping up the military government and its
remaining supporters. A series of bloody insurrections
erupted in 1143, and quickly overwhelmed the military
and its bureaucratic organs.  The upper classes were
purged and evacuated, ethnic pogroms spilled rivers of
blood, and high-tech warlords clashed with advanced
weaponry over territory and industrial assets.
<P>
In the late 1150s, with most of the cities now under
the firm control of an emerging class of community
leaders fed up with the endless chaos, and the
Consulate blockade and embargo making outside
intervention unlikely, the conflict slowly wound down.
It has never truly ended, however, and new secessions
are continually announced.  But the worst of the
fighting has ended, and the world has slowly
recovered, even reaching its old tech level in 1192.
Currently the world is divided between sixty-three
city-states or city-state coalitions, with none have
the decisive edge that would permit reunification.
<P>
<h3>Culture</h3> Titan has always had a colorful mixing of
populations and peoples.  The original colonists were
a diverse lot, and the vibrance of the local economy
constantly attracted new immigration.  And it is
little suprise that the world's government broke down
along faultlines little different than those dividing
the local population on issues of culture, language
and even religion.<P>

About three dozen cultural groupings have been
identified on Titan, and their geography is
complicated, often overlapping the chaotic borders
that criss-cross between the fueding city-states.
These groups have neither rhyme nor reason in their
distribution, and a city state will rarely be
homogenously populated by just one group, and in some
cases may have population samples from as many as
twenty different groups.  Fortunately it is politics
that is the main divider, and ethnic and cultural
tensions only provide a convenient form of organising
individual and group identity around without attendant
conflict.<P>

Unlike Xenough, a world very similar in disposition
where a strictly hiearchal, almost caste dominated,
system of social order is maintained, no orderly
division exists between these groups, and a fluid
balance of power is maintained through a mixture of
"visible hand" efforts by local officialdom and
cultural-economic bartering.  This entails the
creation of a visible geography of power and money, as
negotiated by the members of various communal groups.
The upshot of this is a counter-balkanisation within
major communities, where political manuevering has
permitted the legitimisation of each group according
to how much they contribute to the community as a
whole.<P>

This creates a system of status that is accorded in
public parades known as the "Pagaent of the Masses"
whereby the local populations will congregate at
certain times in a public area, and a represenative
procession will parade a short distance.  The
procession is divided by status indicators such as the
ostentatious display of ornate clothing and jewelry
for the powerful and influential, down to the
unassuming simple tools and appearances of the lower
classes. The cultural affiliations are interspersed
throughout, but since a single cultural group may
embrace several different social strata, balkanisation
is effectively banished.
<P>

<h3>Political</h3>
<P>
The breakdown of the old government created
a vacuum that would have been difficult to fill by a
single government.  With sixty-three quarrelsome ones
it has been nearly impossible.  Unity on collective
issues has been elusive, and possible only in a
handful of vital areas, such as system defense, and
the agreed need for reconstruction. But aside from
widespread meetings with Consulate officials,
agreement and coordination have not been attempted on
even a regional level.
 <P>
Most of the disagreement is ideological, economic and
political rather than cultural. With the discrediting
of the old elites and their government, there has been
much grasping for a replacement system.  Had the world
not been so fractured to begin with, in all likelihood
progress would have been slow, and a system similar to
the old would be imposed by the new local governments.
But with 63 different states come a multitude of local
experiments.  Some five different categoriess/factions
of political organisation have been identified:
<P>
1. Progressive: The Progressives are the closest to
being a voluntary class of governments.  These are
city-states whose order and organisation permitted the
importation of offworld ideas and money, much of it
originating among the Consulate's Regency minority.
The best progress in reconstruction has been among
these states, and in most of them most traces of war
damage have been obliterated.  Local elites have
emerged, markets have been developed, and the standard
of living easily exceeds the pre civil war level.
Unfortunately, their success has often outstripped
other surrounding communities, generating jealousy.
And Avalaran corps, largely freed to do as they please
by the increasingly oligarchic Consulate government,
have come to influence and dominate some Progressive
states, and use them to extend their own economic
power at the expense of other city-states.  Given the
growing power of the Progressive faction, it is now
the leading edge of warfare for the forseeable future.
<P>
The Progressives are the smallest faction, a mere nine
city states, but they are the most powerful.
<P>
2. Autarkists: In contrast to the Progressives, the
Autarkists seek solutions and systems that are
tailored to the local environment.  Unfortunately, no
consensus exists as to what methods are best suited.
Autarkist states run a wide gamut of government types,
from socialist and anarchist states, to severe
military dictatorships.  The Autarkists are more a
category than an organised party, and most of them are
isolationist, even xenophobic. The degree of economic
success, living standard, reconstruction and
reintegration vary widely.
<P>
Autarkists are the largest faction by far, comprising
over half of the world's city-states
<P>
3. Redemptionists: The aftermath of the war has been
worse for some regions than any hardship that existed
before.  The Redemptionists are more category than
faction as well, and are united by a nostalgia for the
pre-war days.  Many of those that espouse it are
city-states that were most rewarded for their loyalty
to the old order, and suffered the worst violence as a
result.  Or they were rebellious factions that
suffered severely, or have become disenchanted with
self-governance.  Other than a sense of lost destiny,
no real cohesion links them together.  Some twenty two
city states can be classified as Redemptionist.
<P>
4. Nationalists: Some ethnic leaders have put forward
the idea of reorganising the world's political
structure along confessional or ethnic lines. For the
most part, these leaders have little popular support
outside of their immediate grouping, but their
agitation has elevated tensions once again in regions
where their people have a majority stake.  Most new
secessions that have occured since 1195 have been due
to the handful of groups that have followed the
Nationalist faction willy-nilly.  For the most part
these groups have been increasingly isolated, and a
mere dozen city-states espouse their beliefs.  In many
cases ethnic cleansing campaigns and bloody
confessional wars have steadily reduced their power
and influence.
<P>
5. Forlorn:  In many cases the damage of the civil war
has lead to a breakdown of all civil order in an area,
and anarchy or balkanisation exists within the bounds
of a single region or city-state.  These are the
Forlorn, where living conditions have deteriorated
into primitive levels.  Their numbers include post-war
cities from the other four categories that destroyed
themselves, or failed to survive on their own in the
succeeding vacuum.  Forlorn cities automatically
recieve an Amber Zone, regardless of their actual
conditions.  Most Forlorn cities are found in the
Northern Scarps, and their exact numbers are
uncertain, as in many cases they break up into smaller
communities that either subdivide the city, or move
out into the wilderness on their own.

Those worlds and moons listed with a government code
of 6, are administered by a trust company established
and overseen by the Consulate government.
<P>
Hecate and the Wanderer are both rogue captured bodies
of very ancient origin.  Hecate is thought to be
nearly nine billion years old, most of it spent in
darkness away from any star. The research stations on
the world study the world's odd geology.
<P>
Chimaera is warmed by interactions with Typhon's
magnetic fields and ambient warmth.  Curiously, no
native life has ever formed, and imported life
predominates.  However, the offworld species have
shown unusual mutations, and a bizarre ecosystem has
evolved over the last eight hundred years.
