Norg was once a major resource center, but centuries
of exploitation for industry on Askigaak has exhausted
its resources. After the Collapse, and the founding of
the Industrial Development Program, Norg's naval base
underwent a transformation into a training facility,
specifically one that instructed IDP worlds and their
people that ran their industries in the art of
shipbuilding. The local shipyard is an fully operating
facility, but is run by the Ministry of Shipping to
train engineers, managers and workers from worlds that
recieved shipyard facilities as a result of the IDP or
private investment. It also stamps MoShi's particular
methods over most of the Regency's ship construction
programs and design series.
