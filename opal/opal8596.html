Noghon was settled by the same waves of Lintlan
colonists that colonised Beaxon. Unlike its neighbor,
however, less mixing with other groups has occured.
The result is that the local government and culture is
more modelled upon the religious society of the
homeworld, with a few liberalising civic and cultural
innovations adopted from either Beaxon or Tobia. The
original Totality belief structure has been heavily
modified, with the pantheistic deity being replaced by
a all pervading secular state system, that
rationalises the obscure tenets of faith, and directly
mediates or carries out its dictates in a
materialistic and mechanical method. The result has
been rather comical, creating a near police state
organised along the lines of Newtonian deism to
satisfy ecclesiastical demands. (Imagine the DMV
handing out driving tests dictated by the Bible, and
you have a good idea of its flavor.)
<P>
Unlike Beaxon, the local government is described as a
mandarin state, with local public monopolies and
paramilitary units being the primary institutions. The
religious commandments of the Totality religion have
been in many cases converted into laws or customary
observances, but are enforced by secular authorities.
Public observance of local cultural observances is
inculcated from the day of birth. The first years of
education spend as much time on rote indoctrination in
the local Blue Book that dictates individual behavior
as on reading or writing. State run schools are
responsible for most child rearing after the age of
ten, with adolescents being guided and "corrected"
through their deviance of their pubescent years by
state dictate. Adults are generally kept in check by
their bosses and peers, and a customary system of
gossip and snitching keeps the authorities informed
and deviant behavior in check; since the Psionic
Reforms psionic spying has become acceptable as well,
and the locals have a Morality Corps that is modelled
directly upon the Zhodani Tavrchedl.
<P>
The state tends to take a paternalistic stance in most
of its dealings with its citizenry anyway, and years
of massive indoctrination and the obedience to
coercive pressure has literally bled most resistance
from the populace. Because of the heavy emphasis upon
groupthink, individual Noghonians are ill at ease when
exposed to pressure situations without the safety
blanket of the group. Personal initiative, except
within the acceptable limits of Good Morality, is
eschewed. As a result they have a reputation for
listlessness and punctilious obedience, and many
offworlders derisively refer to them as Robots or
Clogs.
<P>
Noghon itself is a young world of about 2.8 billion
years in age. Despite the oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere
multicelluar life has not progressed vey far beyond
some complex plants and invertebrate life, in large
part because of the high output of the local K-class
star. The surface of the world is rather hot,
discouraging the evolution of larger animals and
plants. Because of its youth it is deeply incised by
mountains and deep canyons, as erosion has not yet
softened or worn down local geological features nearly
as much as on older worlds. Four continents exist,
though the largest of these, Nyutopia, in greater in
size than the other three combined. Nyutopia is mostly
interior desert, giving away to deep river valleys
covered in heavy scrub forest, and finally a narrow
coastal plain seperated by a high escarpment. The
other continents are located at higher latitudes, and
are covered mostly in either tundra or ice deserts,
leaving most settlement to occur on Nyutopia.
<P>
Poor soils have discouraged agriculture beyond grazing
of herd animals, the population is one of the most
carnivorous in the Regency. Local sea life is edible
and easily domesticated, however, with one crab like
lifeform, the Gatikii, forming one of the main staples
of the local diet. Because of food distribution
problems, most population centers are located on the
coasts near regions where Gatikii and other local
staples are cultivated and raised. It is thought that
remediation of food shortages led to the unique if
excrutiating local government structure and mass
acceptance of its edicts. Heavy manufacturing is the
primary source of income for the local economy, in
many cases huge factories that each employ hundreds of
thousands of workers on assembly lines. Most of these
were constructed more to give people some means of
survival or something to do than for profitability or
productivity. With local markets closed to most
offworld investment, however, there is little
incentive to carry out necessary reforms. The Regency
government attempted to use the IDP to open up the
world, but to no avail.
