Giikusu is orbited by three crumbling moonlets. Debris
from these has surrounded the world and created a
dusky but beautiful ring system that is the most
memorable image of this world. Otherwise Giikusu is
very nearly worthless in the eyes of most people. Even
during the height of the Imperial period, the world
was bypassed by the main trade routes from the
Imperial Core. <P>

Much of this had to do with the world's long history
of military coups and dictators, many of whom were not
keen on offworld competition or immigration
undermining their power. In an exercise that was
mirrored hundreds of times across the Third Imperium,
the bureaucracy and local nobility were convinced to
leave the world's deplorable political and economic
situation alone, and stare the other way. The main
conflicts are between the worlds largest landholding
families, and center on economic issues. These
families have controlled most of the world's
productive farmland, industry and power generation
facilities, and the remainder of the population are
free agents who hire on with their estates wherever
they can.<P>

The three most powerful families are the Issingtons,
the Harashdis and the Ibn Naudi. For most of the
worlds history the Issingtons have dominated, but were
overthrown in 991 in a coup led by the Harashdis. The
Harashdi' rule was extremely unpopular with the other
families and a good portion of the population, and
before the Imperial Civil War the rulers were
struggling against an insurgency backed by the Ibn
Naudi family. In 1128 most of the Harashdi family fled
from the world for the Ziru Sirkaa, and the Ibn Naudi
took over.
<P>
Since the Collapse the family has ruled Giikusu in an
increasingly progressive fashion. Many other families
fled during the Abandonment, leaving much of their
property idle. The Naudi have proposed to dissolve
these dormant lands and turn them over to the
population, in exchange for becoming hereditary
monarchs. Many families that fled have opposed this
action, and it might be illegal under the world's
legal code. Nevertheless the Ibn Naudi have rallied
major popular support, and the world might be heading
for a major conflict.
