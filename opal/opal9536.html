<h3>Cronor Subsector</h3> Cronor Subsector has seen only a
few minor changes since 1132. While immigration has
swelled the local population, no mechanism exists to
permit the kind of government changes seen in the
Regency.  One interesting development, however, has
been the annexation of unassimilated Non-Zhodani
systems, including several former Imperial colonies
that were conquered during the Second and Third
Frontier Wars.  Worlds like Narval and Whenge have
retained their culture with little or no interference
by the Zhodani Tavrchedl.  No one in the Regency, at
least publicly, admits knowing or understanding the
reasons for this permissiveness, and the situation has
been watched very closely by the Regency Trinity and
other intelligence services. Unlike many Zhodani
border subsectors, Cronor has shown a willingness to
trade with its neighbors, perhaps because of the
locals accustomisation with Non-Zhodani.
Unfortunately that openess has attracted billions of
ragged, scared Zhodani refugees fleeing the
inexplicable situation in the Zhodani Core, and has
swamped its worlds with hungry and unemployed Proles
that are draining the subsector in terms of resources
and social peace.
<P>
<B>Population (1117/1202):</B> 9.0/21.4 Billion
<BR><B>Industrial Worlds:</B> 1
<BR><B>Mean Tech Level(1117/1202):</B> 12.1/13.5
<BR><B>Senate Contingent (Quar and Plaven):</B> 13

<h4>Chantrel</h4>    <B>1117:</B> C366243-9
      <BR><B>1202:</B> C366577-A         ZE<P>

This pleasant agricultural world has attracted several
sizeable offworld colonies since 1191. These groups
simply began appearing one day, and seizing large
tracts of land for themselves in defiance of the local
planetary government. The Zhodani 12th Fleet has a
sizeable patrol presence insystem to monitor the
situation, and this may have deterred violence between
the different factions.

<h4>Rio</h4>          <B>1117:</B> C686648-8
        <BR><B>1202:</B> B686648-A         GA<P>

Rio was colonised, as were several worlds, during the
Rule of Man. The world was isolated for centuries,
with recontact with the Third Imperium in 490. In
subsequent centuries, the government kept itself
neutral in the conflict between the Imperials and the
Zhodani, though it has enthusiastically traded with
both powers. The Collapse and Quarantine saw the world
being annexed by the Consulate, though technically it
considers itself to be independent.

<h4>Zhdienshdo </h4>  <B>1117:</B> B21169B-C
        <BR><B>1202:</B> A21179B-D         ZE<P>

Formerly known as Gesentown. This world is a base for
a large contingent of the elite Consular Guard, and
its position is somewhat unique as a result. The CG
units based are not apart 12th Fleet's command
structure, and answer directly to the Subsector
Council on Cronor. This arrangement indicates that
this force was intended, during the long
Imperial-Zhodani conflict, to prevent "cultural
infection" of colonial governments and the local
military structure by outside Imperial influences.
Despite the relaxation of tensions with the Imperials,
this garrison remains in place, and has been
increasingly vital in the face of the Zhodani Exodus.

<h4>Cronor</h4>       <B>1117:</B> A6369A5-D
        <BR><B>1202:</B> A636AA5-E         ZE<P>

The capitol of Cronor has seen significant growth
since the Collapse. Unfortunately, most of this has
been just in the last ten years. Local services were
already badly strained when the Zhodani Exodus began,
dumping another ten billion people upon it. The world
remains orderly, though military police units are
increasingly evident in the refugee camps.

<h4>Whenge</h4>       <B>1117:</B> D648500-8
       <BR><B>1202:</B> B648743-A         CD/ZE<P>

Whenge was a poor, desperate colonial remnant of the
Rule of Man. Ecological degredation and intercommunal
violence reduced the planet to ruined anarchy, and it
was partially interdicted by the Zhodani Navy. The
sudden expansion of trade with the Regency, and a need
for a shortcut across the Cronor Cleft, compelled the
subsector council to open the world to development.
Initially the local tribes were hostile to the
community growing out of the new downport, but have
been enticed out of their own communities by offworld
trade.  Persons of Solomani-Zhodani descent is the
most rapidly growing segment of the population.

<h4>Algebaster</h4>   <B>1117:</B> C665658-9
       <BR><B>1202:</B> C665758-A         **<P>

This former Imperial colony was tolerated by the
Zhodani government because of its strategic location
along the Cronor Cleft. The system has no gas giants,
and all refueling material must come from the world's
seas. This has permitted the original colony to remain
unmolested for centuries, though it has made the lives
of Zhodani merchant crews miserable.

<h4>Indo </h4>        <B>1117:</B> E334662-6
       <BR><B>1202:</B> C334766-7         **<P>

This world was settled by generation ships from
Nerewhon, and is considered its colony, even though
the local government hasn't actually had much contact
with the motherworld since planetfall in the early
1000s.  Indo is not a world of many attractions, and
the Zhodani have been content to leave it alone.

<h4>Nerewhon</h4>     <B>1117:</B> E738475-7
        <BR><B>1202:</B> D738475-7         **<P>

Nerewhon was another ROM remnant. The world was
heavily factionalised, and overpopulation threatened
its surviving habitats. Never fully trusting the
Zhodani, the world's factions assembled several
"generation" ships, and launched them to Indo in the
970s. After the launch of the last ship, one of the
larger factions attempted to seize total control of
the world, and the resulting war slaughtered 90% of
the population.

<h3>Jewell Subsector</h3> The Zhodani worlds of Jewell are
currently in a state of limbo. The Zhodani Exodus has
dried up trade with the Regency, and encouraged
raiding by Vargr corsairs and Pack elements.  The
subsector has remainded a backwater, and probably
could not stand in the face of a larger disaster.
Perhaps this explains the upswing in contacts between
the Regency and the subsector council on Dieterbriavr,
and the close cooperation between the Regency 212th
and Zhodani 11th Fleets in Exodus relief operations.
<P>
<B>Population (Zhodani, 1117/1202):</B> 20.9/32.3 Billion<BR>
<B>Industrial Worlds (Zhodani):</B> 2
<BR><B>Mean Tech Level(1117/1202):</B> 9.2/9.9

<h4>Condyole</h4>    <B>1117:</B> E7A1522-8
       <BR><B>1202:</B> D7A1664-7         VI<P>

The world is currently controlled by a junta of mixed
human-Vargr composition. The world has suffered a
steady degradation of its life support margins over
the last forty years.

<h4>Puparkin</h4>     <B>1117:</B> C7B3386-9
(0902)       <BR><B>1202:</B> C7B3553-9         VI<P>

This world is rife with factions. The old government
was displaced by a feudal technocracy following heavy
fighting between the local human population and
invading Vargr corsairs. The world is very much a
centerpiece of the Pack, and most of the economy is
under its control.

<h4>Zenopit</h4>      <B>1117:</B> D130546-7
       <BR><B>1202:</B> D130598-7         AD<P>

Zenpoit was seized by the Federation of Arden in a
military strike in 1113. After heavy resistance was
put up by the locals, the Federation decided to put in
a more amenable government, which seemed to win over
the locals. Nevertheless, as Arden has suffered severe
economic hardships in the last decade, control over
its colonies has hardened, and new tensions are rising
on several, including Zenopit.

<h4>Ainzaia</h4>      <B>1117:</B> E410644-6
       <BR><B>1202:</B> D410644-6         VI<P>
Formerly known as Ao-Dai. This world was devastated
during the Ancients Final War, and its population
lives in deep craters created by asteroid bombardment.
The world recieved a major influx of Vargr refugees in
the aftermath of the Collapse, and relations between
the newcomers and the Consulate government have been
rocky.

<h4>Pequan</h4>       <B>1117:</B> E5656B9-4
        <BR><B>1202:</B> E565669-4         AD<P>

Pequan was seized by Arden in 1121. Unfortunately, its
administration is no more popular than the old
government.

<h4>Tlaqril</h4>      <B>1117:</B> B638665-8
       <BR><B>1202:</B> B638788-8         VI<P>

Formerly known as Foelen. This world was attacked
several times in its past by Vargr raiders. The
Post-Collapse period saw it recieve its independence,
but its security is once again in doubt as the
Consulate teeters on the brink of anarchy.

<h3>Querion Subsector</h3> Like the Zhodani worlds in
Jewell subsector, Querion is staring into a cold, deep
abyss. Long an underdeveloped subsector, the local
Zhodani worlds do not have the resources to handle a
major political crisis. Unlike their Jewell brethren,
their worry isnt the threat of military invasion by
Vargr raiders so much as an economic collapse.  The
local subsector council on Shiadlia has already
signalled its inability to govern in such
circumstances, and control of the subsector has
effectively shifted to the command structure of the
local 17th Fleet.
<P>
<B>Population (1117/1202):</B> 19.0/30.2 Billion
<BR><B>Industrial Worlds:</B> 2
<BR><B>Mean Tech Level(1117/1202):</B> 8.0/11.3

<h4>Yiktor</h4>       <B>1117:</B> C6B6431-A
        <BR><B>1202:</B> C6B6487-A         **<P>

This chlorine shrouded world was controlled by a
bizarre council of cloned oligarchs that were
perpetuated from the original council that colonised
the world. Unfortunately, the local tech level could
not prevent genetic drift among the clones, and the
council finally ceded power to a less formal
bureaucratic government in 1182.

<h4>Xhosa</h4>        <B>1117:</B> EA95124-4
       <BR><B>1202:</B> EA95546-6         CD<P>

Xhosa was colonised by Zhodani from Shiadlia in 1136.
The locals willingness to adopt Imperial and Solomani
traditions, and to spite the Consulate government, has
led to a longstanding rift. Xhosa is host to a taint
created by a panoply of bacterial and fungal hosts,
and this has been accepted as an excuse for the
colonists extreme "aberrant" behavior in the eyes of
the Consulate.

<h4>Rushu</h4>        <B>1117:</B> E766664-4
        <BR><B>1202:</B> E766784-4         GA<P>

This world was dominated by the descendants of a Vargr
Cruiser that misjumped here during the Third Frontier
War. Relations between the Vargr oligarchs and the
local human populace led to a low level insurgency in
the early Civil War period. But the detailed
government change has more to do with the actions and
influence of the Thanber Conosolidated Properties
(TCP) Group and the Aika-Namon mining corp, which
imported mercs to defeat the old government and
install a more amenable one based around a more
pro-human faction.

<h4>Bael</h4>         <B>1117:</B> E200100-8
        <BR><B>1202:</B> B200476-A         CD<P>

Bael is divided between rival mining corps, Regency,
Zhodani and others. Even a couple of Aslan corps have
a presence here. Baelians are fantastically rich, but
have recognised that the Lanthanum wealth will
eventually run out, and are providing for the world's
future by investment in improved infrastructure and
education.

<h4>Retinae</h4>      <B>1117:</B> E8C69AA-5
       <BR><B>1202:</B> C8C6A8A-8         **<P>

The world's Tashaki minor race seems to study the
staff of the Regency research station as closely the
staff studies them. Around 1130, the locals suddenly
instituted a more regimented culture, with a
government that closely resembled the Delta station's
hiearchy. The world has been rapidly accelerating its
technolgical development ever since, a situation that
has concerned and fascinated both the Regency and the
Consulate, and led to increased information sharing
about this mysterious world, an arrangement terminated
by the recent Zhodani Exodus.

<h4>Niabritedl</h4>   <B>1117:</B> E596400-4
        <BR><B>1202:</B> D586510-6         CD<P>

Formerly known as Asmodeus.  Details are given in <cite>Regency Sourcebook</cite>.

<h4>Faisal</h4>       <B>1117:</B> D443436-3
        <BR><B>1202:</B> D443556-5         GA<P>

The local landowners council was quite corrupt and
incompetent. The world has a significant CO2 taint,
but the council was incapable of keeping up with
filter manufacturing.  RISS was in the process of
negotiating a shift in government, when unidentified
offworld elements (though Thanber is suspected) sent
in mercs at the behest of several local interests, and
overthrew the government.

<h4>Shiadlia</h4>     <B>1117:</B> B254788-9
        <BR><B>1202:</B> A2548A8-A         ZE<P>

Formerly known as Querion. The local bureaucracy was
apparently unprepared for an emergency of the
magnitude of the Exodus, and the commander of the
Zhodani 17th Fleet placed it under his control in
1198. For a world whose primary industry was
government, a decline in authority could be disastrous
economically. Shiadlia is unusual in that it is a
double world, sharing its orbit with its sister,
Erioque, which contains the main military base in the
subsector.

<h4>Thanber</h4>      <B>1117:</B> B243653-C
       <BR><B>1202:</B> A243755-C         CD<P>

Thanber was a "corp" town in the Antebellum period,
being dominated by Tukera. After the company withdrew
from the Marches, and was subsequently destroyed by
Virus, the world government turned to former Tukera
personnel and subsidiaries to survive. Regency and
Zhodani security services have traced a number of
criminal and military enterprises in the old DMZ and
Foreven to Thanber and its TCP corporation.

<h4>Anselhome </h4>   <B>1117:</B> C110588-8
      <BR><B>1202:</B> C110547-A         **<P>

Anselhome replaced its government in 1138 in an effort
to attract new trade and investment.

<h3>Vilis Subsector</h3>
<P>
Federation of Arden Data<BR>
<B>Population:</B> 20.0 Billion
<BR><B>Industrial Worlds:</B> 1<BR>
<B>Mean Tech Level:</B> 11.0

<h4>Caloran</h4>      <B>1117:</B> C796746-5
        <BR><B>1202:</B> C796646-5         AD<P>

This once prosperous world is symptomatic of Arden's
overexpansion and subsequent declining power. Despite
its richness, it has been caught in the Federation's
long economic slump, and its population has declined
as workers leave for richer oppurtunities in the
Regency. Even the world's vital distillery industry is
showing signs of collapse.

<h4>Arden</h4>        <B>1117:</B> C5549CB-8
        <BR><B>1202:</B> A554ACB-B         AD<P>

Arden's listed tech level only applies to its civilian
populace. Its military factories and shipyards can
produce TL-13 and some TL-14 materials, and its forces
are equipped to those levels. The Federation of Arden
has long suffered from its unwillingness to sign the
Spinward Accords, leading to its isolation by other
powers in the Marches. The Zhodani Exodus has
presented an oppurtunity to the Arden Society to
excavate their fortunes, and Federation military units
have been quite active in those areas of the old DMZ
adjacent to their territory.
