  <P>
Settled in the aftermath of the Psi Supressions as a
sort of last resort colony. Mostly covered by water,
with most of the landmass scattered large islands and
archipelagoes. Most of the land came under the
domination of the colonial bureaucracy, which soon
evolved into a fuedal system of bickering landlords.
This fuedal arrangement is known as the Custodiate,
and consists of an elite council of landed and
hereditary peers who represent the population as a
whole. The Custodiate debates and deliberates issues
of common interest to all of the lords, sets taxation,
maintains a common legal code and judiciary, and
resolves disputes between various landlords. The
Common people have no voice in government, and the
Custodiate successfully derailed popular agitation
during the Representational Reforms.
 <P>
Lakou's economy is primarily animal husbandry and
truck farming. Low population densities guaranteed
that local communities would be tied to their lords
landholds. The lack of transportation infrastructure,
and the indifferent attitude of their lords created
isolation and seperation between these communities,
laying the foundation for conflict.  Frequent fighting
over land and water resources escalated into mini-wars
engulfing entire regions of the surface.
 <P>
The increase in TL, and the Representational Reforms
actually exaceberated local tensions. In the last
twenty years, about a dozen small wars have erupted
between the most powerful landlords. Most of these
attempts take the form of "filibustering" by offworld
mercs who infiltrate a rival landhold, posing as
seasonal workers or legitimate security troops, and
launch an uprising in the name of their actual
employers.
 <P>
Offworld analysts doubt if this upswing in violence is
merely coincidental, citing evidence of involvement by
offworld speculators and oppurtunists. Many mercenary
units involved have been of professional standing
greater than what the locals need or are able to
afford. If it is an offworld powerplay, by either
business interests on Mirriam, or former megacorp
personnel carrying out an independent enterprise, it
is have unintended side effects.
 <P>
In the last five years or so, a growing proportion of
the landlords' tenants and retainers have been
abandoning their posts and jobs, and striking off on
their own.  Most of these people were originally
promised land and a secure life of their own as part
of their lords contractual obligations to their
retainers. But the fighting coupled with their lieges
tightening control over their lives has created a
grassroots reaction.  Calling themselves
"Freeholders", these people have been seizing unused
or unclaimed land, often with assistance from merc
units stranded onplanet after failed filibusters.  The
tension and conflict this has created with the ruling
Custodiate adds an even more lethal layer to the
world's Amber Zone rating.
