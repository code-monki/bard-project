This high-population world fell into anarchy once the rule of it's 
mother world Vanguardia collapsed in 1132. Equipment ran amok, dashing
millions to death, competing demagogues rallied supporters and allies, and
in the resulting conflagration more millions perished. The world of Strom
stepped into this maelstrom in 1136, taking command of the close airspace,
striking at lead elements of all the major factions and commanding that
the conflict be stopped, and some order restored.<P>

By 1137 a working
bureaucracy was in place, running the world satisfactorily, with the
former faction leaders installed as the 
Princes of their administrative districts. The government watched the rise
of Strom with some unease, as it harboured a wish to one day reach the
stars on its own, and control it's destiny. The government started a
campaign to get access to the treasures of Dodo in 1152, but was rebuffed
by Strom. This caused no end of grief, as the populace considered Strom to
be ungrateful for the help it had received 
from it's technicians and scientists that set her on her technical rise.
Strom's opinion was that that aid was the least that could be expected for
her role in stabilising the world.<P>

 In 1156 matters were brought to a head
by a revolt led by some of the more reactionary princes, which was held
back by the efforts of Merlon Detran, Prince of Gernadia. In the
tumultuous years that followed, Deltran accepted a figurehead role as
World Monarch, and accepted the remaining loyal Princes into his Royal
Family. With stability assured, the government set out to out-tech 
Strom, but set upon it in a heavy handed way, setting unrealistic targets
for projects, and punishing workers who could not meet targets. By 1191 it
could be considered a TL-A world, and trade to it rose enormously. However
it was also increasingly oppressive, with passes and authorisations needed
for almost all everyday needs.With the death of Monarch Merlon I in 1195,
and the ascension of his daughter Celsia, attempts have been made to
influence the hierarchy, but to little
effect.<P>

 Most of the Pact fear trouble in the next few years, but there
seems to be little that can be done about it. Strom has started some
co-operative programmes, like the programme to construct jump drives, and
aid in supporting Leroy's new Scout Base, but nothing seems to be working.
