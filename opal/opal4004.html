The former capital of the  oddly enough  named Khavle subsector. Khavle 
was one of three high population world within the subsector. During the 
Hard Times era it managed to stablize its tech level at 11 and retain a 
class C starport.  This was a secondary facility brought up in importance 
after the destruction of the old class B main facility and the attached 
Scout Way Station in a Black War raid. The world was the founding menber 
of the Khavle Accordment a small four world polity (the other menbers being 
Accra, Forward and Tsinan). A year after Virus first struck, all  active signs
of civilization ceased. During the Hard Time era, like most  well  populated 
worlds outside the faction Safe, Khavle experienced wide spread unemployment. 
The fashionable solution in both Diaspora and the Old Expanses sector was to 
put part of the population in hibernation until such time as conditions 
improved. The solution actualy proved to be a double blessing. Not only 
were large portions of the unemployed taken out of circulation, no longer 
draining scarce resources, but the actual construction of the underground 
facilities needed  to "store" them provided large scale work projects 
employing those who chose not to wait out the crisis.
<P>

As off  1200 over 7 million  sleepers still wait to be awaked. This might 
seemed like alot of people by New Era standard but this number only actualy 
represent 0.01% of the old population. The facilities are built to TL 11-13 
standards, depending on their time of construction. The old Scout Way Station 
underground hangars still hold the last remains of  the Accordment small navy. 
These include a Shukugan SDB, a Far trader and a TL-11 1000-ton light cruiser 
built at nearby Medora which boasted one of the sectors few remaining
shipyards, until the final collaspe. The base also contains a  few
smallcraft and a decent supply of spare parts. The underground hangars also
hold a single Gazelle-Class Close Escort, the former property of Halleck
Starmerc: one of the menenaries under retainer to the Accordment. Because of
Khavle's location on the Vampire Main and the burried nature of the base,
few Free Traders have had a chance to pick the facility clean (or the world
for that matter). With a little help the old PAD sysyem could be brought back
on-line and the remaining population revived turning Khavle into a bastion of
civilization in this part of the sector.
