Perrior is little more than a huge factory world.
Where other worlds in the Thinrim attempted to shut
out the Post-Collapse reality of accomodation, the new
local government smelled a wonderful oppurtunity.
Reasoning that the Aslan would need a plethora of
manufactured goods for their weak defenses and economy
on this side of the Rift, the local bureaucrats
directed investment money into new shipyards and
factories designed to Aslan specifications, that would
produce goods primarily for the Aslan markets, and
provide both a bridge and a lever over their
recalcitrant neighbors.  Aslan architecture and art
predominate on this world, a side effect of this
courtship.
