  <P>
Froin (0539) was a ball of low grade rock with no
resources and nothing to attract major settlement.
First discovered by the Darrians in the pre-Maghiz
period, who accorded it no importance, it was equally
ignored by the Third Imperium during their expansion
into District 267 in the 400s.  For most of its
history only a small starport and its surrounding
community existed to serve the rare enterprising or
foolish trader that made it out this far.
 <P>
This isolation eventually attracted the Ministry of
Science's attention, when it was looking for a world
to build the Spinward Marches Research Station Zeta.
Zeta was intended for genetic manipulation research,
and Froin's lack of a population and thin atmosphere
were deemed acceptable for containment and concealment
of the stations experiments.  While not as secret as
Vanejen's now notorious Research Station Gamma, or the
controversy around Trojan Reach's supposedly defunct
Delta, it's isolation permitted it to host research
projects for the Navy, Scouts, Ministry of
Conservation and some shady elements of the nobility
and intelligence services.
 <P>
But the world underwent a major expansion after the
Collapse.  While not as important as Iderati or Emape,
about twenty percent of all the Coil's traffic passes
through its huge port.  Most ships that pass through
are low jump independents that are making an interface
from the Coil along the lower Spin Main into Plankwell
on their way to Collace or Forine.  About ninety
percent of the current population is employed at the
starport. The port is the fourth largest in Five
Sisters, and unsupervised automation became a
necessity out of the huge traffic load and the
overworked staff.
 <P>
Research Station Zeta's geneering projects,  were
mostly terminated after the formation of the Interior
Ministry.  Its current work is heavily classified,
though many suspect that it is now bent towards Viral
research. It is thought that the mission change
reflects the nature of Froin's increasingly
computerised economy.  Many analysts think that the
world has become a testing ground for a plethora of
anti-viral countermeasures, and perhaps even
domesticated Viral strains.  In support of this
thesis, it has been noted that all of the worlds
operating electronics are cleared through the station
before they are installed on any piece of machinery or
put into operation.  Much of this includes a number of
modifications or custom additions not standard to
these systems.
 <P>
And the RASAC archives hint at a massive Viral-organic
integration project centered somewhere in Five Sisters
subsector at a facility only improbably described as
"Bellowing Moose." If Froin is home to a massive
experiment in Viral assimilation, no direct evidence
has yet surfaced, and RQS has publicly denied any such
project exists, much less in operation on Froin.
While this creates nervousness among visitors, and a
whirlwind of speculation and conspiracy theories
safeside, it has not dampened trade at all.  And most
native Froinians, have taken time out from their busy
schedules to express outrage at RQS, for not
realeasing this technology in full to relieve them of
their heavy workloads.
