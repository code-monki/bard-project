Sui'Tang is known as "Old Blue Eye" to spacers in the
region. Around half a million years ago, a massive
asteroid or comet slammed into world. The resulting,
massive crater became a repository for most of the
world's normal rain runoff, and is today the sole
ocean on the world. The round body of water appears
incongruous against the brown and yellow background,
and gives the world its name.
<P>
Sui'Tang is a former colony of Magash, and was a
battleground between the two major factions that used
to dominate the world. With the homeworld too
inhospitable for major conflict, proxy wars on the
colony became an acceptable substitute. Exhaustion
with this cruel rule increased the locals agitation,
and independence movements began to wage war against
the homeworld's forces. Finally the world received its
independence under the Rep Reforms in 1158.
<P>
The world's main economy is grain farming. Magashi
commercial concerns dragged the systems almost
pristine cometary ice down to the world's surface to
irrigate massive grain fields that produced food for
the homeworld nations.  This economy continues today,
though with independence, Magashi buyers have to
compete with the interstellar market in general.
