<H1> Mortal Coil</H1>

<HR>
  The Quarantine erected by the Domain of
Deneb in 1131 against the AI Virus threat had a double
edge. While it created an impetus of proactive defense
against a deadly enemy, it also threatened the Domain
with economic stagnation.
 <P>
The original Quarantine Protocols were written in the
heat of the crisis, and the drafters went overboard in
stipulating its  stringency and strictness, creating
regulations that no nation could, much less would, be
able to abide by.  Licensing and inspection
regulations were so narrowly defined that
international trade would be curtailed severely, to
the detriment of local economies.  Unfortunately,
popular opinion in the nascent Regency would not allow
for a relaxation of regulations, even when it became
clear the cost would be economic inflation, the loss
of currency exchange, smuggling and severe economic
hardship.  And other nations, insulated from Virus by
distance, were threatening unilateral actions of their
own.
 <P>
With the Regency's own economy still reeling from the
Civil War and the Collapse, Norris and his advisors
made two decisions that staved off these problems to a
certain degree.  Firstly the Regency adopted a policy
of allowing other signatories to both the Protocols
and Spinward Accords to define the extent and merit of
their own Quarantine efforts, and only threatened
sanction against states that were negligent or abusive
of Viral protection measures, or violated the spirit
of the Accords. Secondly, the Regency set aside a de
facto free trade zone in Five Sisters Subsector.
Already "airgapped" from the bulk of the Regency by a
zone of territory unprotected by the Quarantine, the
Sisters would be like a canoe sailed into a lagoon
under the watchful eye of the main ship, allowing
outsiders to freely trade with its inhabitants without
violating its security and safety.
 <P>
The Sisters had other strategic advantages as well. It
lay at the convergence point between the Marches,
Trojan Reach, Foreven and Beyond Sectors. It was close
both established trading partners, and new untapped
markets.  It wasn't to far form the "Hub" of Lunion
Subsector, and therefore the bulk of mainstream
Regency society.  And the antebellum trade routes that
led into the Regency converged like a funnel on to the
nearest branch of the Spinward Main, in Five Sisters.
 <P>
It also lay in close proximity to a J-2 route that was
originated by Barrchai Technium just before the Civil
War. The route ran from Emape/Five Sisters, through
the the Avalar Consulate in Foreven Sector, and
branched off in two directions: one through the Union
of Meizirn and the Corellian League in Beyond Sector,
and running down through Vanguard Reaches from the
Duchy of Treyln to the Murians; the other ran from the
Marrekesh Trade League down the trailing side of
Beyond, to the Florian border, through the Federation
of Garrone, and down through the Aslan Hierate into
Riftspan Reaches and Touchstone.  BT had already
heavily invested money and effort to build
infrastructure, trade contacts and logistical sources
along much of the route, and the Regency pressed this
network to the hilt (recompensating BT nicely ).
 <P>
BT advertising called this route the "Gold Road."
Among those who both benefited and lost from this
trade route, a different name came into use.  They
called it the Mortal Coil.

 <P>
The root of the Mortal Coil traderoute is Regency
territory in Five Sisters/Spinward Marches Subsector.
Five Sisters was primarily a military possession in
the Antebellum days. Despite being at the farthest
spinward extent of the Spinward Main, and composed of
some rather rich worlds, development was prevented by
the Imperium's feud with the Zhodani. What colonies
that did develop were mostly in support of the local
208th fleet and its ancillary facilities. The
transience of military families, and the subsectors
physical seperation from the rest of the Imperium gave
it a remote feel, a kind of passing dreamland where
the darkest human emotions that were normally bottled
up could be given free play.
 <P>
Alongside strict military spit-and-polish was a
freewheeling anarchy, a kind of larger than life
intoxication that expanded upon the usual roughness of
frontier life and blew it up into ridiculous portions.
Even as remote as it was, it attracted the Marches
weekend malcontents; those wealthy or well-off who
harbored either a disatifaction with mainstream
society for various reasons, or were just empty thrill
seekers looking for a playground.  These people were
supplemented by real malcontents, especially
survivalists, runaways and various cranks.  In
addition to local military personnel and the unusual
nature of their assignments, and the stress this
created, the subsector was a volatile mix of people
skirting the borders of accepted norms.
 <P>
After the Collapse, the "weekenders" started becoming
permanent residents of the Sisters.  The first ones
were members of various ecological groups who moved
into untouched garden worlds such as Galadriel and
Prince Edward. But the main group were a mixture of
sober investors and wild economic adventurers that
began to move here in the late 1130s to take advantage
of the subsectors relaxed Quarantine enforcement.
These people were speculators, market managers,
finance professionals, would be robber barons,
oppurtunists, scoundrels and just plain scum.  The
resulting mixture of all of these groups, and both the
tawdriness and glittering wealth of the new "Gold
Road" created a region of Imperial Space like no other
in its history.
 <P>
The base of this frenetic activity was the trade
moving through the subsector between the Regency and
the Spinward Hinters.  Most of the Regency-bound
trade, because of technological and industrial
imbalance, was mostly raw materials from distant parts
of the Hinters, dumped into vast collection yards on
<A href="opal9508.html">Mirriam </A>and Iderati for loading into sleek and
efficient safeside bulk carriers.  Meanwhile, outbound
ships loaded mostly with Regency manufactured goods
departed for <a href="opal9000.html">Beyond</A> and Foreven.  The lopsided nature
of this trade, and the vast amounts of mineral wealth
passing through Five Sisters, and the tawdry local
speculation and dirty dealings surrounding that
wealth, earned the subsector the name "the Rand"
(after the infamous Witswatersrand in South Africa.)
 <P>
It was a fitting appellation. The subsector was full
of men and women whose fortunes rose and fell on the
flow of materials and money, much of it pilfered, that
filled its docks.  It had an elite of self-made
nouveau rich who had climbed up through shady dealings
and ruthlessness, often over the bodies, both
figuritavely and literally, of their former business
partners.  It was lawless, to the point that the
Regency military was of no use.  It was, as one writer
put it, "Las Vegas, the wild frontier, Disneyland and
Hell all concentrated into one easily digestible
wafer, whose effect was full and the same no matter
how small a portion you broke off for yourself and
others."
