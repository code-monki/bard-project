Al Uqayr, like Montane, was another pleasant world
overlooked by the interstellar mainstream. In this
case, the system was set aside by the subsector
nobility as a site of future development, with the
date of that happening being constantly postponed.
Perhaps the nobles has originally intended most of the
world for themselves, but were too distracted to
execute their plans, and too self-absorbed to open the
system to other developers. Since the Collapse and the
Representational Reforms many local landholders have
sold or converted their set aside onworld estates to
interested offworld parties, and the world is finally
coming into its own. Most of the Post-Collapse
population are retired Quarantine, Scout and Merchant
personnel, and their children seem to prefer those
careers, creating a strong link with those
interstellar organisations.
