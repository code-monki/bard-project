<P>

  In every stellar community it seems, there is a place
for the non-conformist or the outcast.  And in every
stellar community, there is an impetus or a practice
of cruelty that compells rejection of mainstream
society in favor of a shining dream of justice or
prosperity at its expense.
<P>
Bebeto was settled early in the history of the Avalar
Consulate as a rich agricultural source world that
supplied grain and meat to the capitol and its
neighboring worlds. It was an unremarkable world for
the most part, one that was simply never at the center
of attention by the Avalar government or the swirling
vortex of bureaucratic intrigue manifest in the
capitol or Milne and Daphne. That ordinariness was
reassuring to the rest of the Avalar Corridor, and
made the world a welcome haven and reststop for
workers and professionals attempting to leave the
madding crowd, at least for a while.
<P>
But in the late 900s Bebeto began to attract a throng
belonging to an extremist and bizarre religious cult
known locally as the Neo-Pythagoreans.  The cult was
made up of people disappointed or disenfrancised by
the stagnation, desiccated rationalism and stifling
spiritual poverty of life within the Consulate.  They
espoused a lifestyle based upon classical depictions
of Pythagoras and his Sicilian cult on ancient Terra.
This included a superstitous belief in numerology, and
the basing of their entire society upon a
quasi-mystical association between harmonic values
based within music. The cult refused to pay taxes,
honor military service, or recognise the Consulate as
the sovereign authority; attempts to crack down led to
violence with the authorities on other Consulate
worlds.
<P>
The Pythagoreans, or the Church of the Golden Ratios
as they preferred to call themselves, somehow acquired
a massive tract of upland plateau known as the
Varsinian Heights, and most of the faithful came to
live their in a decade long wave of immigration.
Their silent protest induced other desperate groups to
immigrate and convert, and the community came to
number in the tens of millions.  The implicit defiance
of the group upset the Consulate security services,
and a siege by the military and the Shanza secret
police in 1004 led to open fighting.
<P>
Fearing that confrontation would only widen
dissension, the Bebeto and Consulate governments
offered a compromise, leaving the CGR alone in their
holding in return for their acceptance of Consulate
law and sovereignty outside of their marked
boundaries. The Churce accepted this compromise in
1005, but only after recieving guarantees from the
Zhodani ambassadors and wringing out additional
commercial concessions.
<P>
Today Bebeto shows no signs of the past strife, and
the CGR has softened its stance towards the outside
world. While still strongly anti-modernist, many of
the original cultists came down from their holdings
and mingled with the secular culture in the lowlands.
A number of hardline communities remain in the
Varsinian Heights, but are isolationist and remote.
The church's influence upon Bebeto is quite noticeable
in its architecture and culture, which seems heavily
slanted towards a "Creeping Geometrism."
<P>
The arrival of Regency immigrants in the post-Collapse
period has created something of a cultural flowering
on the world, as the migrants have lended their own
artistic and religious ideas into the mix, creating a
resrugence of interest in ancient Solomani arts like
cubism, neo-classicism and impressionistic arts like
jazz music.  It is remarked by more than a few
outsiders that Bebeto is the one bit of spice in the
Consulate's otherwise bland soup of worlds.
