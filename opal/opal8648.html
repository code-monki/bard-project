The population of Eshamlii are primarily civilian
contractors that work for either RISS or RQS. In
antebellum times these mostly worked as civilian
contract workers on X-Boat tenders along the strategic
corridor from Deneb to Tobia. Since the Collapse the
workforce has been shifted to outsource work, allowing
the Quarantine and Scout Services to concentrate their
resources and personnel upon the war against Virus.
The local scout base is primarily an administrative
and logistics facility, and contractors provide nearly
all of the workers for its warehouses, workshops and
secretarial pools. The base also provides maintenance
for a large percentage of RQD 4s RQS units.
<P>
The world's shipyard is owned by the small Deneb based
Lensman LRC. Lensman is a specialty builder of
planetoid SDBs, and the local belts are a primary
source of hull material. Suitable rocks are
preselected by belters, often into varying
displacement classes, and are moved into parking
orbits closer to the mainworld. When a client wishes
to purchase one of the companies SDBs, a rock of the
desired displacement is towed by one of the companies
specially modified tugs into high orbit around
Eshamlii, and conversion components are shuttled up
from the yard.  The completed vessel then moves out of
orbit under its own power to await pickup by a jump
shuttle or tender for delivery. Since the Collapse
Lensman has built more than six thousand of these
craft for use on the Frontier or around vulnerable
worlds.
