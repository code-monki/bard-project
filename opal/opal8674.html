Ishiri is the only free standing world in its
diminutive system. The world's continents are locked
up in a single large landmass that nearly divides the
world into two halves. The two oceans are almost
completely cut off from each save for the southern
pole. This causes warm water currents to circulate
heat through the chilly southern regions, helping to
moderate the local climate. While deep inland regions
can be blisteringly hot, coastal regions are very
temperate. These cooler temperatures attracted farmer
colonists in the 130s, who established massive grain
farms on the well watered veldts just inland from
their coastal communities.<P>

Blessed with plentiful food and a comfortable standard
of living, the world attracted a steady flow of
offworld immigrants. Ishiri was very much a backwater
world, and its simple industrial technology and lack
of major social tensions were appealing to people
fleeing the overly civilised Imperial Core. This
sentiment became a quasireligious philosophy that
emphasised the rejuvenative powers of nature and the
land, and the population came to see their world as a
redemptetory reliquary where communal simplicity was
emphasised over more spectacular technology. Even as
the population grew, rather than concede the utopian
aspects of their society, the local government instead
nationalised the land, dividing it among public
collectives that would symbolically share it with the
entire population and even the outside universe if
necessary.
<P>
Even before the Collapse Ishiri had a population of
8.5 Billion people crammed into crowded coastal cities
and offshore communities. After the Collapse, the
world offered solace to a growing number of refugees
displaced by the Abandonment. A large number of these
came from high population worlds scattered across
trailing Deneb, and even some worlds in Corridor.
After the Panic of 1140, billions more came from Starn
and Ashasi, lured by the promise of open skies and a
simpler life unsullied by overreliance upon
technology. This subsequent five fold rise in
population soon overstrained local resources and
living space, and the Regency government had to step
in and add the world to the Industrial Development
Program in an effort to reduce the strain.

Despite this intervention, Ishiri's popu<P>lation has
exploded to ridiculous levels. Even more than
Askigaak, overpopulation on a small world has made
life precarious. While the land is still held in
common, the local agrarian socialism is in disrepute,
and more and more squatters have settled in the
interiors on previously working or fallow land. The
coastlines are now two continous megapoli, each
containing approximately 35-40 billion people that
live in an unending strip of apartments and arcos. The
reopening of the Outrim Frontier has created new hope
for the locals, and a long waiting list now exists for
potential emigrants to colonies promised by the
planetary government.
