Formally a  minor TL-12, non-industrial world on the Khavle main. The world 
was well known for its ornithopter enthusiasts, it`s sole claim to fame. 
Ornithopter are a form of primitive hand-gliders which remained  popular as a 
sport in the sector even though higher technologies made them obsolete. Tsinan 
was the fourth and smallest member of the Khavle Accordment, by then local tech 
was down to 8 and the starport to D, enough for minimal offworld contact. Its 
9 million inhabitant were split into seven nations. After the collapse a series 
of wars brought all of these under a single planetary government. The ruler 
of Tsinan can be classified as a TED. The common tech level has dropped to 2. 
The TED, Baron Frederic of Tsinan  holds power thanks to a small quantity  
of TL-12 military gear and a larger quantity of TL-8 gear. The capital city 
has managed to maintain a tech level somewhere between 4 and 5 depending on the 
field, with military  transport  and communication related fields getting 
priority as their are the key factors in retaining control over the population 
of 8 million which is widely spread all over the planet`s dry biosphere.  This
level also allows for the basic industries needed to provide the Vampires with 
the semiprecious resources they demand. 
<P>
With a law level of 11 one would think the Baron is a rather oppressive chap.
In actual fact the Baron grand-father soon realize he didn`t have the 
resources to fight the visiting Vampire fleets and that the only way to 
ensure the survival of the general population was to cooperate, his decedents  
have continued this policy. A few times a year a fleet visits the world 
demanding slaves, food for the ones they already have and raw materials. 
The slaves to be turned over to these visitor are selected by two way. 
The first is to use criminals, these are given basic technical training, 
just enough to make them of some value. The second way  which is only 
used when insufficient number of  long term prisoners are not available 
is by lottery. All  single adults between  20 and 40 are automatically  
entered on the drawing list. Needless to say this system has lead people 
to marry at an early age. This was the best compromise the rulers could
come up with. 
<P>
The high law level is caused by both the need to maintain control in the 
face of  vampire depredations and by the worlds somewhat harsh climate 
which limits  the quantity of arable land. With  TL-2 agricultural 
technique the land is far from being used optimaly.  Actual enforcement level
for civil law is closer to 8. Weapons are strictly controlled as a form of 
more pluralistic government or worse fragmentation into old allegiance 
would prove disastrous for all.
<P>
The Baron is somewhat opened to offworld contact and as been the host to a 
few Guild delegations. These mostly centered on the acquisition of TL-5-6 
machine-tools  and industrial equipment. The Baron  feels that his mix TL-5,
8 and 12 forces a more then adequate for his needs although PAD  and AD 
systems are of some interest  provided the vampires don't find out about them. 
<P>
Overall all considering the situation the inhabitant are pretty well off. 
All receive a elementary level education and thus have a minimum  level of 
literacy. TL-4-5 medicine is widely available. The baron would like to do more 
but the vampire visit are created a climate of technophobia among the general 
population. The Baron cannot be said to be either popular or hated by his 
subjects, is family has been in charge for a long times and that just the 
way things are as far as most are concerned. As for the Baron, he sees  
himself  and the only thing standing between the vampire and Tsinan, for 
the most part he is right. 
<P>
