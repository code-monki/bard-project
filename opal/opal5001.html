Ektorr (1909) is governed by the same monarch who ruled the world
during pre-Collapse times. King Aevan Thodd is now some 127 years in
age, at the mercy of addictive anagathics. The early years of the
Collapse were hard on the Ektorrians. Raised with strong
conservationist ethics due to the planet's very limited resources and
aridity, they had to a point become dependent upon the world's
technology to soften the harshness of their environment. This situation
was exacerbated by the fact that many of the "Tatoos" (the landed
gentry, so named because of their ritual wearing of tatoos to mark
their status) united in an insurrection called "The Awakening." King
Thodd managed to put down this revolution in 1146, but only at great
cost to the world's civil liberties. Thinking himself an enlightened
dictator, Thodd has slowly honored his commitment to return civil
freedoms to the populace, but still maintains considerable military
defenses. His army has been maintained at approximately TL 8, giving
them a distinct advantage over the TL 5 masses.<P>


Ektorrians celebrate the defeat of the Tatoos on "Royal Day." On this
day, the people don their most garish outfits and celebrate with all
forms of debauchery. The other 364 days of the year, they are as dour a
people as you're likely to find.<P>
