Kauai is the fourth of seven moons around the gas
giant Turquoise. Its dry land is primarily volcanic
island arcs created when moving oceanic crust passes
over hot volcanic plumes rising from the world's core.
This geology and the world's pleasant tropical climate
inspired Solomani colonists to name the world after a
member of the Hawaiian chain on Terra. Many of the
islands are pleasantly tropical, which further
reinforces the comparison.
<P>
The world was originally settled by agronomists eager
to exploit its climate for the cultivation of tropical
crops whose rarity BTC made very valuable to its
neighbors. The landholders quickly divvied up the
available land, barring most future immigration. After
the Collapse however, it became clear that specialised
agricultural economies would no longer sustain the
world in the face of Virus. In a move that was nearly
unprecedented, the local landholders voted themselves
out of power in 1140, and set aside a growing portion
of their land for offworld settlement. The holders did
not want to go the other extreme of selling all of
their land, and allowing Kauai to become an eyesore,
and the succeeding planetary assembly is bound by
charter to uphold community standards that permit
fewer than ten thousand people per year to own land.
