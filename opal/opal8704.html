Avernus is one of the most mysterious worlds in the
former Imperium. Solomani colonists that settled the
world during the fourth century discovered a bizarre
set of ruins on its most northernmost continent, ruins
that included the famous Burning Man, Gateway and the
mysterious Ghost Forest. In antebellum times its eerie
atmosphere and "bad vibes" kept away most tourists and
casual visitors, and it prompted a near boycott by the
religious leadership of neighboring Deneb, though they
would never give an exact reason why.
<P>
Avernus appears to have been colonised by Vilani
fleeing Vargr advances into Corridor sector around
-2100. Feeling themselves to be safe, the five hundred
thousand colonists settled the main continent of
Vorshak and returned to a simple agrarian way of life.
Their population slowly grew to about two million by
-900, when prospectors and ranchers moved to the
smaller northern continent of Venona. The northern
settlement lasted for about a decade, when it
mysteriously disappeared for reasons that cannot be
ascertained from colony records. Thereafter the
population went into precipitious decline, losing over
half of its people over the next forty years, though
no few cemeteries have been discovered by
archaeologists, and most of the people they contain
appear to have perished from suicide. The colony
disappears alltogether in -830, and the records from
that period speak forebodingly of "him" coming.
<P>
The world was resettled in 103 by colonists from
Deneb, who renamed it Crozet. Because of their small
numbers they remained largely confined to the warmer
southern continent of Ligle, where they raised grazing
animals for export of their meat and hides. The
discovery of Vilani crops growing wild on Vorshak
attracted both explorers and new colonists, who
subsequently found the remains of the older colony. At
first nothing seemed amiss; the Vilani colony was
simply thought at time to have died out from lack of
supplies or fading gene pool. There were the discovery
of so called Ghost Houses, tombs in the basements of
Vilani houses that contained wooden mannequins with
featureless or grotesque features, which mystified
even other Vilani.
<P>
But in 318, prospectors on Venona discovered a macabre
sight. In some marshy ground surrounding a small
plateau, they found a small building, pierced by a
tunnel that led up a road to the heights above. But
what was truly grotesque was a bas relief sculpture of
a featureless person, hands outstretched in a
crucifixion pose, swathed in either flames or a
flowing red-orange robe, with yellow surrounding an
opening where the face would be. The plateau itself
contained even more Ghost Houses, dead looking trees
and a strange, small hominid like animal that some of
the colonists dubbed Trowies, after a graveyard spirit
of Scottish myth.
<P>
Trowies are 1 to 1.2 meters tall, covered in long grey
or dark brown fur, and have faces with delicate
features and black eyes. They have three fingers and
an opposable thumb, and small mouths filled with sharp
piercing teeth they use to eat local fruit and
insects. They are a grumpy species of animals, showing
no fear of humans or other sentient creatures, but no
friendliness either. They are confined to Venona, with
their range centered upon the weird graveyard that the
locals dubbed the Ghost Forest.
<P>
Psions in that period felt forboding or suffered from
severe neurological pain or dream trauma. Many
colonists actually abandoned the world than live with
such haunting creatures and ruins. But two other
groups showed much more interest. One of these were
the High Ecclesiastics of the To Will One Thing
religion, people that had been studying the world
clandestinely for decades. The other was a bizarre
secret society which denied its own existence, and old
Solomani group called the Calusari (see
Quirinal/Zeng). In 337 the Calusari obtained the
allegiance of the ruling family of Crozet, the
Hewards, and took virtial control of the world. It was
renamed to Avernus, after a portal to the underworld,
in 403. Much animosity exists between the two groups,
though for reasons little understood outside of them
they have maintained a tense standoff for centuries.
Venona has been interdicted by the Calusari, though no
explanation has ever been given.
