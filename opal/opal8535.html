Syr Darya is dominated by massive ranching stations.
Most of the planetary surface is covered with wide
open pastureland, seperated only by barbed or razor
wire dividers to demarcate boundaries. Land barons are
the real power on the world, and the bureaucratic
government was established to prevent the erosion of
their monopoly. Most of the population lives in small
settlements, and people who don't work personally for
the "latifundia" must survive on simple agriculture
and fishing. The world's E class port is actually
several smaller ports, all of which are located within
the latifundia boundaries. The population is strongly
resentful of their lot in life, but the world's
inoppurtune location near the Wilds leaves no real
alternative for political change.
<P>
The wreckage of the 1156 Vampire invasion is still
quite evident. The southern continent is still
littered with destroyed ships and vehicles, and is
still posted as offlimits to civilians and
unauthorised personnel. The gutted shell of the main
command ship can still be seen from orbit, now perched
precariously on several rock outcrops overlooking a
deep valley.
