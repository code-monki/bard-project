Urnas was settled by mining companies in the late
200s, hoping to exploit the world's rich mineral
deposits. About 400,000 years ago, a large nickel iron
meteorite slammed into the mostly silica composed
Urnas, and accretion from this collision created a
massive shatter belt of heavy metals and minerals
ringing the middle latitudes of the world. This leaves
the middle of the world much darker in color than the
poles. While these resources were quite valuable, the
depth of the belt and severe disruption of the
adjacent country rock forced the settlement to be
built at the poles.
<P>
In the north the city state of Veito was built by one
mining group, and at the south the city state of
Nanshyn was built by another. The core of these
communities were the huge water reservoirs excavated
over a period of several hundred years to keep up with
the expanding communities, and filled with water
collected and processed from cometary debris. Between
these two cities parallel tunnels were dug into the
Black Belt, often sprouting communities of their own
in the wake of mining operations. The miners and their
cities were not able to process much potable water for
life support or mining operations, and were very much
reliant upon the pole reservoirs.
<P>
As industry began to replace mining income for the two
cities, commercial competition became the grounds for
real conflict. Rather than directly compete, the
cities used their money and water monopolies to
compell the miners to form proxy armies that fought on
the surface or in the tunnels. Where the two sides
communities and forces came close to each other,
vertical and sloping tunnels were dug in a twisting
three dimensional labyrinth to either avoid or
confront each other. The cheap flow of weapons from
the polar cities guaranteed slow social breakdown
through the centuries, and by the 1000s the world was
an Amber Zone. The polar cities ensured that no
competing industry would develop among their thralls,
manipulating factions to attack any machinery or plant
that could concievably threaten the status quo.
<P>
The Imperial Civil War and subsequent Vargr raiding
led to a temporary truce, and the Domain of Deneb
flooded the world with Army troops in an effort to
create disengagement zones. After the Collapse, the
world was included in the Industrial Development
Program, and some of the equatorial factions were able
to break free of the poles charged influences. But it
was actually the arrival of Vargr Ksonotso refugees
from coreward and their money and work ethic that
finally broke the pole monopoly. Numbering just a few
hundred thousand, these refugees were offered shelter
at an equatorial community under Regency Army
protection known as Sabalberg, where they invested
their money in infrastructure and schools.
<P>
The world is now divided into three main coalitions:
two that are still heavily allied with Veito and
Nanshyn, and the growing influence of Sabalberg. In
truth most local states are still heavily armed and
suspicious of each other. Travel is still made
difficult by various security and "border" checkpoints
between underground communities. Surface travel links
are poorly developed, and travel through the massive
Underground is difficult without paid guides or
updated navigation files, both of whose accuracy is
often compromised by local patriotism and secrecy.
Offsetting this intercommunal hostility is a genuine
obsession for offworlders and their goods, and in most
cases it is not that difficult for travellers to
seamlessly journey through the Underground if they
take an effort to ingratiate themselves and respect
local customs.
<P>
Nasans (as the call themselves) are heavily tattoed to
identify their factional affiliation. Despite steady
improvements in local conditions, the population
prefers their cramped living quarters, and agoraphobia
afflicts many people who have never visited the
surface or other worlds. In many communities preteen
children are taught weapon skills and indoctrinated in
locals claustrophilic prejudices. A few are able to
advance to university training at Sabalberg or the
polar cities, and graduate to work for Regency corps
at the starports or offworld concerns, but they
generally leave behind their local communities,
leaving their stubbornly embittered and smoldering kin
behind.
