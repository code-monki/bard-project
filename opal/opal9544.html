Bevy's oppressive government has survived almost one
hundred twenty years in spite of itself. The Interim
Council was elevated in a coup that ousted the old,
ineffective bureaucratic government in 1073. Its
members were mostly merchants and philanthropists,
plus local industry titans only too happy to live
without the meddling of the old government. Previously
the world's living conditions had declined, and the
Council promised to restore and improve them for its
citizens. Some of these projects, like the Kegena
colonisation program, and strong Imperial support,
temporarily boosted its popularity. But an economic
slump after the Fifth Frontier War and during the
Civil War led to fresh outbreaks of popular dissent,
and it was only the providential arrival of the
Collapse that saved the government from revolution.
<P>
The economic boom in the Midway that resulted from the
heavy demand for locally manufactured goods needed in
support of the Quarantine eased pressures on Bevy and
improved local prosperity. With further assistance
from the Regency and subsector governments, the
Interim Council improved its position enough that it
appears to be the permanent government. The population
is more interested in making money and enjoying their
prosperity than in confronting the Council over its
continued oppressive rule.  Offworld observers have
noticed that the Council has actually expanded its
power at the expense of the populace, and the economy
has begun to suffer as a result.
