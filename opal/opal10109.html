<FONT SIZE=-1><B>Shiwonee Subsector:</B> Shiwonee Subsector has
 an estimated population in 1202 of approximately 605 million, a 
decline of 98.1 percent from its Pre-Collapse population. Its highest 
population is 300 million at Shiwonee, and its highest tech level is
 14 at Strogy.</FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=-1><B>The Shiwonee Subsector (historical):</B>
 Shiwonee Subsector had an estimated population in 1117 of
 approximately  21 billion. Its highest population was 20 billion
 at Lagna and its highest tech level was 16 at Shiwone and Lagna.
</FONT><P>

<B>Subsector Notes</B><P>
 <A HREF="opal9504.html"> Strogy (1121)</A> <P>
 

The Shiwonee subsector holds 7 of 8 worlds belonging to a Pocket Empire
known as "Third Geonee Confederation", which corresponds to the Geonee minor
human race. The remaining member world is in Shokee subsector.<P>
	The Scouts from the Geonee Confederation are starting to explore the
Shiwonee and Shokee subsectors.<P>


	The Geonee are a minor human race native to Shiwonee, traditionally
male-dominated, which presents a number of unusual features: among them, a
close relationship with Chirpers, and an almost fanatic inclination towards
technology. In 1117, the Geonee Cultural Region comprised 9 worlds, 8 in the
Shiwonee subsector, and one more in the Shokee subsector These worlds were
directly or indirectly controlled by a few dozens of noble families. The
Geonee actively supported Lucan during the Rebellion. During Hard Times,
orbital bombardment of key points in the geologically active Shiwonee's
crust caused massive earthquakes through the planet. Hundreds of thousands
of Geonee refugees attempted to migrate towards the Margaret's Safe Area in
Delphi, but Margaret's troops repelled them, often killing or enslaving the
refugees, in what was known as "The Geoneecide".<P>

	In the New Era, 8 of the Geonee worlds (all but Tlasov, which was not truly
a Geonee world but a colony) comprise a pocket empire known as "The Third
Geonee Confederation". The member worlds are Rigaal, Hiponee, Dreva, Lagna,
Stenardee, Ashavakuna (in Shokee subsector), Prindee, and Shiwonee.<P>

<B>Rigaal</B> (0928):
	Totally depopulated in the Collapse, Rigaal holds today an outpost of the
Geonee Confederation, established in 1196.<P>

<B>Hiponee</B> (1027):
	The population descends of refugees from Hard Times. Having nothing but an
empty, pleasant planet before them, the population actually started growing
immediately, once the TL drop was accepted and the scarce present nobles
lost all influence. Recuperation was speed up in 1182, when a secret naval
research station dating to Rebellion times was discovered. Today, seven
different "Cities" manage their affairs independently, although limited
cooperation is possible through the City Confederacy. Most of the
traditional Geonee culture is maintained. The Starport has been constructed
in the last five years using resources from all the Third Confederation. The
old orbital complex is partially active again.<P>

<B>Dreva</B> (1028):
	When the Virus struck, this TL 7 world suffered no catastrophic, immediate
effects, despite the fact that the whole population lived in underground,
sealed tunnels. But, with all interstellar trade gone, there was simply not
enough food for the whole population to survive. A revolution ended with the
assassination of all government bureaucrats. Many people died from the
fighting and from starvation. Some cannibalism cases occurred. After a
while, people started eating Chirpers as meat. Later on, when the population
stabilized and the production of vegetables in the tunnels was significant,
it was obvious that Chirpers were the only source of food. The survivors
have already become used to eat them, so, rather than become vegetarians,
they developed the practice of herding Chirpers and using them as food. A
determinant factor was also that nothing totally unproductive could be kept,
so, in order to allow Chirpers to survive, their meat had to be consumed.
This practice is viewed with disgust by other Geonee worlds.<P>

<B>Lagna</B> (1029):
	Around 27 billion of Geonee died in the system in the Collapse, when
virus took over the systems of the orbital cities and the planet's
environmental controls. A Permanent Salvaging Station of the Confederation
has been established to obtain technological items from this once heavily
populated, industrial, TL 16 system. Whole starships have been recovered and
refitted. The huge number of Geonee dead bodies found in the system has
caused many Geonee to refer to Lagna as "The Cemetery".<P>

<B>Stenardee</B> (1130):
	Totally depopulated in the Collapse. A Confederation base is under
construction.<P>

<B>Ashavakuna</B>(1131):
	This planet was not very heavily affected by the Virus. The economy, based
on exporting agroproducts, receded greatly, but, although the production
dropped, it was far enough to sustain the local population. The Central City
was only abandoned after 5 years, causing the collapse of the democratic
system. This left a power vacuum which was later filled by  the
establishment of The Producers' League, an alliance of technocratic
landlords which still governs the planet. Most of the traditional Geonee
culture is intact, with the landlords taking the place of the nobility.<P>

<B>Prindee</B> (1330):
	The low gravity and tainted atmosphere of this planet have always made it
unappealing for the Geonee. Nevertheless, a new colony of Shiwonee was
established in 1198.<P>

<B>Shiwonee</B> (1430):
	Home of the Shiwonee minor human race, with 1.3 Gs and 1.5 atm pressure.
Geologically
very active, with frequent earthquakes and an important number of volcanoes.<P>
	The planet was left in complete chaos after the artificially provoked
earthquakes in Hard Times and the Virus infection. The social organization
disappeared almost completely, substituted by practical, survival criteria.
Twenty years later, a Female Revolution re-unified the planet, completely
changing the Geonee culture. Shiwonee is now governed by an egalitarian
democratic system. The females are granted equal rights, a fact that strikes
Geonee from other worlds.<P>

<B>Lost Geonee</B>:
	The failed migration attempt towards Delphi in Hard Times and the slavery
practices associated to Marquess Tanzer's Geoneecide left many Geonee
stranded in strange worlds when the Virus struck. It has been speculated
that some groups of Geonee could have survived far away from the Geonee
worlds. Some voices are claiming that the Confederation should attempt to
find the "Lost Geonee".<P>

	 

<B>Selruke</B> (0921):
	Half a dozen of tribes of almost barbarian nomads survive in the planet.
The Vampire Fleet based at Strogy has occasionally raided this world to
capture children who can be trained as technicians or tripulants.<P>

<B>Adep 5</B> (1223):
	Roughly half of the surface of the planet is desertic. The population
inhabits the more temperate areas  in a network of communities. The world is
governed by The Farmers Council, a charismatic oligarchy formed by the
descendants of landlords and executives of former agricultural corporations.
The world has suffered occasional raids from the Vampire Fleet based at
Strogy.<P>

<B>San Son</B> (1322):
	San Son is a jungle planet, with extremely dangerous flora and fauna. Only
a few sparse, small communities survive, having lost all memory of
pre-Collapse times.<P>

<B>Revie</B> (1621):
	Before the collapse, Revie was governed by a feudal system based on
technical classes. When the Virus struck, the world was left in chaos for
several decades, until a single, charismatic leader was able to re-unify all
the planet. His daughter is the current leader, with the title of Queen.
Under her rule, Revie population has actually experienced a steady recovery
and has, in fact, slightly exceeded the pre-Collapse level.<P>
	In the last decade, Revie has been able to put in operation a small fleet
of half a dozen old starships, under the command of a former Naval officer
who hibernated in 1130 and was discovered in-system in 1185. Some scouts
have contacted Forquee (Forquee subsector, 1719).<P>

<B>Far Trinity</B> (1025):
	The population descends from a lost expedition from the first centuries of
the Third Imperium. Cut off from the rest of the stellar community, the
Trinitans evolved a conservative culture based on stability and tradition.
The collapse had almost no effect on the planet, except for the fact that
the world was being held captive by a foreign power, and Virus effectively
removed the invaders. Now, Far Trinity is governed by its most traditional
legislative branch, a group of 19 individuals known as "the Makers of
Rules", elected to single six-year terms.<P>

<B>Nindaro</B> (1428):
	The world is governed by a self-perpetuating oligarchy descended from
Imperial nobles and Corporate Executive Officers from Hortalez et Cie, who
took over all the available resources after the Collapse. The world is
technophobic, and so Technological Level has stabilized 4 levels under the
original one. Nevertheless, population has experienced a slight recovery.
<P>	
Nindaro has been recontacted by scouts from the Geonee Confederation, but
the ruling oligarchy is keeping this fact secret from the general
population. The confederation has still not decided its policy with the
Nindaro government.<P>

<B>Pohkrow</B> (1629):
	Three different populations inhabit the planet. One, numbering over
100,000, descends from Geonee refugees from Shiwonee ("Lost Geonee"), who
were stranded in the planet when fleeing back from the Nes'Vra subsector,
after the start of the Geoneecide. They are governed by a charismatic,
technically-oriented oligarchy. The second, slightly smaller, descends from
ordinary refugees from all over the subsector, settled in the world by a
corporation during Hard Times. They are governed by a democratic system. The
last one, nomadic in nature and numbering just a few thousands, descends
from the original, true inhabitants of the world, and are governed by a
self-perpetuating oligarchy based around a few families.<P>
	The two major populations inhabit areas thousands of kilometers away, but
are aware of each other. However, contacts have not been peaceful. The
Geonee community is "humanophobic", due to harsh memories from the Geoneecide.<P>

<B>Bisks Planet</B> (1630):
	A few xenophobic, technophobic communities populate the scarce islands of
this water world.<P>
