Kutadis is noteworthy for its heavy forests and rich
floraculture. The planets largest continent of Arborea
(70% of the local landmass) is geologically stagnant,
the result of dormant rifting and slow tectonic
progression. The subsequent lack of orogenesis
(mountain building) and the minerals that are
weathered from them, gives Arborea poor soils.
 <P>
This creates a rather unique evolutionary problem.
Arborea is well located within a temperate zone
amenable for the growth of forests and grasslands, and
the lack of mountains does not impede the huge troughs
of tropical moisture that sweep through during the
northern summer.  But the poor soils require that
trees be niche dwellers to a degree not normally
expressed by most temperate flora.  The result is an
explosion of arboreal diversity almost unparalleled in
charted space.
 <P>
Kutadis is home to over forty thousand species of
trees, and twice that number in shrubs and herbs.
While the planet lacks much advanced fauna, the
diversity in that area is also stupendous.
Exploration and commercial has been daunted by the
huge task of cataloging, assaying and domesticating
such a vast number of species.
 <P>
Ironically, antebellum society had little interest, or
was just plain ignorant, of a treasure like Kutadis.
Much of this was probably local cultural bias: most of
the nearby worlds were populated by tech-starved
Imperial communities more interested in industrial
development than in poking and prodding stodgy old
trees.  Kutadis also has a wide array of amazingly
poisonous fauna, and the world was deemed to be of
little interest for development.  Nor did it help that
it neighbored the then interdicted <a href="opal9300.html">Novoterre</A>, with
Imperial Naval units from the interdiction patrol
showing up to alleviate tension or boredom by using
the planet for impromptu target practice (interdiction
patrol in non-Imperial space was widely considered in
the antebellum Navy to be the most mind-numbing duty
crews had to suffer through).
 <P>
First settlement came in 1071 with the establishment
of an E class starport by the Imperial Navy to aid
stranded or disabled passing ships.  A survey by the
IISS demonstrated the world's huge diversity, which
led to the formation of a joint venture company, based
on both Urnian and <a href="opal9508.html">Mirriam</A> - Five Sisters, to explore
and exploit the world. The company, Aeschus-Brunave
LIC, established a research station onworld in 1090 to
do basic botanical research and suggest development
options to the company for marketing.
 <P>
This preliminary assessment recieved a boost from the
lifting of Novoterre's interdiction in 1129. By that
time Aeschus-Brunave's botanists had developed a
number of basic products that were uncompetitive with
high tech substitutes, but were perfect for a TL 5-8
world like Novoterre.  Many of these products were
simple medicinal, confectionary and structural
products that Aeschus-Brunave percieved would be in
much demand given Noveterre's volatility.  Money made
from sales of these products would underwrite the more
expensive research into high-tech alternatives, and
the longer ranged expeditions into the outback of
Arborea.
 <P>
So far, about 300 hundred species of trees have been
cultivated and adapted for sale. Most of these
continue to be harvested for sale to Novoterre, but
the market has been steadily widening to include the
subsectors other industrial worlds, and possible
export markets in Avalar and Marrekeshi space.
Products so far marketed have included, cheap
biological plastics and rubber replacements, chewing
gum and candy, a medicinal suspension gel with better
absorption qualities than gelatin, a gutterpercha
replacement (known pithily as "Bettapercha"), vitamin
concoctions, toxic waste removal technology, fiber for
medical applications, biodegradable lubricants,
antibiotics and anticarcinogens, and even explosives
(which brought a "concerned" delegation of Regency
Marines to the company's operations, and subsequent
demise of that particular product line.) These are all
the low tech applications so far marketted, and only
just scratches the surface of what possibly could be
achieved.
 <P>
The company compound is located right at the starport.
The listed TL is the result of the companies
restrictions on destructive industrial technology, as
it doesn't fully understand the world's ecology, and
doesn't want to muck it up (yet). The entire
population is equipped to TL-10 standards, and the
local security forces enjoy TL-13. The local economy
is centered around large, heavily guarded groves of
trees that exhibit both easy growth and useful
properties. Genetics labs, storehouses and vehicle
parks make up the rest of the compound.  The species
raised here make up only a very small number of the
ones exploited by the company, and the rest are deep
in the forest, in carefully guarded locations, that
can only be reached by air rafts with special location
transponders monitored from the downport or in orbit.
 <P>
The company has an extensive number of backwood
encampments populated by armed caretakers. These are
backed up by a growing surveillance net in orbit, and
by a company sized contingent of combat armored
infantry and their g-carriers. Interlopers who have no
apparent business in-system are carefully monitored by
a squadron of starmerc gunships, and are invited to
leave if they persist in loitering. Smugglers and
trespassers, it should be clear by now, are neither
welcome (nor survive long).
