Hysyl was primarily a refuelling stop for ships en
route to and from Corridor Sector. Originally commited
to remaining in spite of the Viral threat, most of the
population abandoned the world after the Kishkii broke
through the local defenses prior to the Rape of Trin.
Since then the world was used mainly as a staging
center for RQS and Navy units operating against roving
Vampire Fleets along the Great Rift interface. The
world was declared a trade interface in 1202 after the
Regency Senate declared the Frontier open to limited
trade and travel, and local population has swelled
considerably with immigrants and oppurtunists. The
local D-class port is slated for upgrade next year to
a B-class facility, which will bring even more
immigrants in the coming years.
