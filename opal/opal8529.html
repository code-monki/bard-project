The homeworld of the Haniiwa minor race. The Haniiwa
are a semi-aquatic species that lives in the surf zone
of the world various coral islands and reefs. They
resemble the Terran Assassin Bug, and they are
descended from acquatic predators. The Haniiwa were
originally open ocean hunters, before climate change
and overhunting forced them to take up "aquaculture",
domesticating and raising their favorite food species.
Organised around loose pack structures, they formed a
collective of communities under the control of a
represenative-style authority. When first discovered
in the 400s, the species had attained TL3, aided in
part by their successful manufacture of metal
implements. Their world was interdicted as per
Imperial law, and were blissfully unaware of the
greater universe. <P>
Military units from the Assemblage of 1116 invaded the
world in 1122, and a base was established to support
further raiding operations against other neighboring
Imperial worlds. The first contact between the Vargr
and the Haniiwa went badly, and sporadic fighting
erupted between the two groups. When the Regency
declared the world Fait Accompli in 1132, it did so
without a clear idea of the situation, and the
announcement caused the Haniiwa to declare a total war
against the Vargr. Regency troops had to intervene to
prevent a massacre of Vargr refugees, and the two
groups were disengaged with great difficulty. The
Vargr Ngorsraek live in a fortified chain of islands
in the cold northern polar region of the world, well
away from the tropics loving Haniiwa. MoI and RISS
patrols keep the two groups from bumping into each
other, and protect both groups from the others
aggressions.
