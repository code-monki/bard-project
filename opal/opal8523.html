Formerly known as Caladib. The world has a high amount
of poisonous hydrogen sulfide gas in its atmosphere,
the result of very active volcanism. The smell of
rotten eggs was never very appealing to humans, and
the world never attracted serious colonisation despite
its pleasant climate. The extent of the Imperiums
interest was the construction of a midsized naval
base, which attracted a few hundred workers that
served local concessions and entertained offduty naval
personnel. The Aegzaeng corsairs seized portions of
the world in 1120 for the Assemblage of 1116, and the
Domain of Deneb was forced to evacuate the base. The
corsairs could not exploit their conquest, and were
content with building fortifications around the base
and downport to prevent a Domain counterattack. The
world was declared Fait Accompli in 1132, and the
Aegzaeng set a course that was independent of other
Vargr factions.
<P>
With little industry to sustain them, and mindful of
the massive naval and RQS presence on their world, the
corsairs have merged most of their fearsome ground and
naval forces into the Regency military. These forces
are officially "allied" units, and not officially
sanctioned line units under High Command control.
Nevertheless these forces earn income for their home
community while serving on the Frontier, and the
Aegzaeng have closer relations with the military than
most former corsair bands or Pack groups. The J'sia
colony was established by refugees in 1159 at the
invitation of local leaders, and is an increasingly
important part of the local economy.
