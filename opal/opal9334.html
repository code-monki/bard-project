Ringun is a "pivot" world. All low jump traffic from
the coreward and rimward halves of the Avalar
Consulate has to pass through Ringun and nearby
Isobel. The importance of this focus makes the world
the focus of strong naval security, even though its
distance from the borders makes an attack by an enemy
highly unlikely.
<P>
The parallels between Ringun and Robalin are the
result of their shared colonial history. Combined with
their shared dependence upon ship traffic, and their
complimentary economies (Ringun's land agroproducts in
exchange for Robalin's oceanic resources) has created
enough goodwill for a power-sharing arrangement
between the two governments, and they are considered
to be one unitary government.  Robalin generally takes
the lead in inter-Consulate affairs, while Ringun
handles domestic economic and social affairs.
<P>
Ringun is a lot more downheeled than its neighbor, and
attracts a rather seedy population of castaways and
"slummers." Much of this is due to to the production
of a highly addictive brandy known rather unpleasantly
as "Bilge."  Bilge is a secondary product from another
fermentation process of the fruit of the local Trelzil
Tree, which produces a luxury wine of above-average
quality known as Quislind. For every liter of
Quislind, four liters of Bilge is produced, and to
spare the expense of disposing of it, the local
vinters sell it on the open market. Bilge is a
green-tinted liquor that is 140 proof, and contains
other addictive alkaloids, which makes its the port
wine of the 57th century. Bilge is illegal on most
other worlds in the Consulate, except for Ringun and
Robalin, and the latter strongly regulates its sale
and marketing.
<P>
Ringun's cities are notorious for their communities of
bilge addicts, and several are little more than
massive "skid rows" where homelessness and deprivation
consume a major portion of the population.  The
Consulate government tolerates the deviance that
occurs within these communities, seeing it as a means
of eliminating a problematic portion of the general
population.  For its part, Ringun does provide basic
care and health services for addicts, and even
addiction treatment, but it has done little to abate
the Bilge trade, though it does transfer rehabilitated
addicts to other worlds to prevent recidivism.  And it
does not help that Quislind, too, is addictive, and
often causes a downward spiral that eventually lands
members of the upper class in the "Bilge-pool."
<P>
Quislind and Bilge is estimated to account for about
twenty percent of the worlds economy, and taxes on the
product makes up much of the Combined Governments
revenue.  Critics decry this "robbing to abet"
practice, but their protests have little moved the
Consulate government to do anything.  Most of this
criticism occurs offworld, as the Combined Government
often harasses and supresses dissidents and critics
with its own police.
