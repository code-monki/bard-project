Lome has been a longtime powderkeg world. A handful of
states controls the world's rich aluminum and titanium
mines, and have used the profits from this bounty to
create a comfortable lifestyle for themselves. The
other states must subsist on the remittances of
contract workers sent to toil in the mines. This
arrangement, and the vulnerability of the mining
industry to disruption, effectively prevents the
poorer states from seizing the mines for themselves.
But it has not prevented them from building up
sizeable military arsenals as a means of intimidating
the wealthier states. Saber rattling is the main form
of diplomacy on Lome, and the populations of the
various states are accustomed to speaking to each
other in a language of threats, insults and
accusations. Offworlders are also subject to this kind
of abuse, and there exists a long history of violent
"incidents", usually brawls, between the locals and
visitors.
