Halka is described in the Grand Tour adventure in <cite>Traveller's Digest</cite>
#19.
<P>
Halka was first settled by the Ancients around
-300.000. Though no physical remains exist of their
base, their presence is indicated by the existence of
an albino human species.  The Halkans are not true
albinos, and their adaptations seem to be the result
of natural adaptation to their bright M9III star
rather than deliberate engineering by the Ancients. As
a people they were peaceful, a preferred a pastoral
existence.
<P>
The Florians contacted the world in 211, and quickly
subjugated the inhabitants.  The original Barnai
rulers took the simple lifestyle of their new subjects
as a sign of inferiority, and employed them as slave
labor. This practice continued for some time after the
world was absorbed into the Florian League, and only
ended after a public outcry in the 900s. Emancipation
landed most Halkans into destitution, and most
remained as tenant farmers for their former landlords.

<P>
Recidivist elements among the local nobility continued
to exploit these people even after the League passed
laws protecting them from offworld predation. Several
of these elements were involved in a plot led by the
local RGM of Vorkash Manufacturing in abducting the
Halkans for servitude in the company mines on nearby
Viceroy.  The exposure of this operation led to a new
and lasting crackdown on the slavers, and a full
military garrison was stationed onplanet to prevent
future incidents.
<P>
Halka remains a primarily agricultural world. The
native population has slowly assimilated into the
Florian mainstream, displacing a number of established
Barnai landlords in the process. The world's
population has been kept steady by emigration of the
Florian population stemming from the slow transferance
of land back to its original owners.  Large scale
immigration has been prevented by the continued
uncertainty between the two groups, and by the
difficulty of offworlders in adapting to the planets
very long year.
