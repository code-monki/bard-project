Nosea is just as it says: "No Sea."  While the world
is easily accesible to j-1 trade ships coming down the
Spinward Main, it was not settled by the pre-Maghiz
Darrians as a colony, and its name originated in the
disgusted reports sent back by Sword World scouts din
reference to its lack of refueling sources in the
system. Despite its UPP listing, nearly all of Nosea's
surface water is locked up in the world's extensive
ice caps. A mere five to seven percent of its water
exists in free liquid form, in concentrations too
small to satisfy even the smallest jump capable ship.
<P>
This lack of refueling sources enabled the rebuilding
Confederation to use the world as a natural chokepoint
in limiting commercial and military access.  A massive
military base was constructed in system, that served
to both deter aggression by the Sword Worlders, and as
a launching pad for punitive operations when their
neighbors did act up. Eventually the base became the
Confed Navy's main training facility, responsible for
nearly eighty percent of its basic and MOS training.
<P>
This heavy military presence is the world's main
source of income, as most of the population is
employed in some base related function.  After the
Collapse, the Regency Navy was invited to share the
facility for crosstraining between them and the DCN.
The base has been expanded into a full operating
Regency naval base, even though the Confeds are still
in nominal command. Nosea is a major major manufactory
of the shared Barekdoldin design (actually, just a few
are built here to create the impression it is).
<P>
Nosea is governed by a specially apointed council of
retired or detached duty DCN officers, selected by the
Naval Command. This council runs the world in the
brutal manner of a prison camp, and security is tight
to the point of smothering. Nosea's function is
training, and Darrian military training is severe and
heavily controlled because of the dichotomy of
civilized violence inherent to military service and
the dilemma it poses to mainstream Darrian society.
<P>
Unfortunately, the physical and mental discipline that
recruits are subjected is rubbed off by the Council,
and extended to every corner of life on Nosea.
Military personnel of all ranks must adhere to the
same code of regulations and conduct as recruits,
which isn't much of a problem for them. But civilian
personnel are subject to full military regs as well,
and also have to run the gauntlet of intrusive
security services running constant surveillance over
their personal lives, and who launch random
interrogations of unsuspecting workers. This
"philosophical fascism" has irritated the civilian
population for decades, and has become worse since the
adoption of the Quarantine.
<P>
Base security prevents any actions more substantive
than silent protests and petitions to Mire about
specific treatment. For the most part the Navy and its
administration prevail, and the civiians are left to
simmer in their frustration. The Regency's presence
has further complicated the situation. Regency naval
personnel have their own enclave on the planet, and
are subject only to their own Uniform Code within its
boundaries, which is a lot more lenient than the local
regulations.  Outside of their own boundaries these
personnel become subject to the same onerous rules as
everyone else, but diplomacy requires that the Council
be lenient, or as they put it, "understanding" to
their allies.  Needless to say, this has polarised
Nosea into strictly pro and anti-military camps.
