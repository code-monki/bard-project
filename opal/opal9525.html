Uniqua almost sounds like "unique." It is agreed, by
many parties along the interface of the Marches and
Foreven that the world has been a unique center of
controversy, adventurism and politcal folly. From it's
inglorious beginnings to the bloody present, the world
has been an embarrassment to all parties foolish
enough to make it a stepping stone for greater
fortunes.
 <P>
Uniqua was first settled from neighboring Garoo in the
aftermath of the Second Frontier War. Why it chose
THIS world, and at THIS particular time, or even opted
to create a colony in the first place puzzles
post-Collapse historians. Garoo had neither the
technology, nor the political wherewithal, to sustain
a colony. Even with substantial monetary support from
the Zhodani Consulate, the colonial government
abandoned the world scarcely twenty years after
settlement. There was no advanced warning of this
abrupt ending of contact, though Garoo had struggled
for years to support their colony's survival. The
colonial government simply up and left, showing little
or no concern for the colonists and their survival.
 <P>
But instead of abandoning the world, the population
literally dug in. The domed cities were gradually
dismantled and transported into specially excavated
cavern complexes. Building and containment material
from the cities, and whatever machinery that could be
maintained, were used to construct huge hydroponic
gardens within these caverns. Many early cave cities
perished or failed before the colonists hit upon
workable systems and combinations, controlled pests,
and successfully harvested crops and recycled oxygen.
A strict recycling ethic was imposed upon the
population that lived in these caverns, with violaters
thrown out aboveground without survival equipment as
punishment.
 <P>
Enough income was generated from exports of foodstuffs
to Garoo that the colonists were able to afford the
purchase of simple to maintain advanced technology
such as photovoltaic cells and fuel cell engines.
Colonies were linked by an ingenious underground
transit system of narrow-gauge railways powered by
electricity generated from methane release in the
hydroponic gardens.  Despite the harshness of life on
the world, most of the populace enjoyed a fairly
comfortable lifestyle.
 <P>
The success of their abandoned colony wrankled the
Garoo government, who derisively referred to the
world's hydroponic complexes as "their secret
gardens." Despite the import of Uniqua's vitally
needed foodstuffs, mutual resentment made relations
between the mother world and colony rather chilly.
This was rather ironic given both world's emphasis
upon communal centered institutions at the expense of
the individual.
 <P>
Resentment boiled over into greed. It is thought that
Garoo harbored plans for a military or economic
takeover of the world as early as the Third Frontier
War, but simply bided its time waiting for the most
oppurtune moment to strike.  That moment came in the
wake of a system failure in 1038, in one of Uniqua's
largest communities.  The inhabitants of that city
were made refugees, and threatened to invade several
neighboring deep cities when they were refused safe
haven. Garoo's Ruling Council declared a military
emergency, and intervened for the "humanitarian
maintainment of order and civil peace." Garooian
soldiers quickly crushed the meager resistance, and
erected a highly unpopular occupation government.
 <P>
Uniquans came to quickly resent this oppressive
presence. While the quality of the government changed
little, as many of its high officials were shrewdly
recruited from the previous planetary government,
Garoo's policies were tailored towards itself more
than the local welfare.  Local prices were fixed for
those local goods that were exported to Garoo, who
also imposed its monopoly upon food and oxygen
production. Trade was limited to barter, at exchange
rates dictated by the authorities.
 <P>
As Garoo convinced itself of its power and growing
influence in the subsector, its expansionistic
policies began to attract the ire of its age-old
Darrian enemies.  Despite the great difficulty of
contact with the world, the Confederacy managed to
contact local resistance groups just before the Fifth
Frontier War, and began to covertly supply them with
arms and support equipment. Escalating violence
between these guerillas and the local security forces
erupted into full-scale war in the aftermath of the
Sworld World Occupation of 1132. Aided by several
brigades of Darrian troops dropped on the world, the
rebels managed to reclaim about seventy percent of the
world before stiffening resistance around the starport
stopped their advance. This event precipitated the
Bularia Incident and the Garoo War.
 <P>
Unfortunately the Darrians attempted their own
domination and takeover of their allies, which,
coupled with their embarrassing withdrawal from
Bularia and its neighbors, created further
balkanisation as the locals attempted to repel them.
Currently the world is divided between the main
resistance (45 percent of the world), the
Darrian-sponsored Unity Council (30 percent) and the
Garoo Colonial Government (25 percent). While the
Darrians were ostensibly forced to remove their line
forces as part of the 1134 armistice, a number of
"colonial" forces remain, armed at TL-12 standards.
Regency and Zhodani diplomatic mediation and posturing
has slowly eased local tensions, allowing the the
removal of the world's post-Collapse Amber Zone in
1189, but there is little chance, given its current
disposition, of reunification any time soon.
