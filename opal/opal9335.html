Elloni has been in an ice age for the last 500,000
years, and fifty percent of the dry land is shrouded
in kilometer thick sheets of glacial ice.  The
ice-free areas are covered in thick permafrost tundra
and forests, covered in marshes and bogs that are
filled by glacial drainage.  Towards the equator this
gives way to sand-dune filled deserts, and finally a
belt of habitable savanna and grassland.
<P>
The desert regions show evidence of a pre-existent
sentient species that lived on the planet before the
ice age, and are thought to have become extinct
because of the climate shift.  The ancient Ellonians,
also known as the Steiger Culture, were a race of
giant quadrupeds that built a complex hiearchal
society based around extensive irrigation projects,
and who built massive stone buildings that rival the
megaprojects of ancient Vilani and Solomani
prehistoric societies. At their greatest zenith, they
had achieved early industrial technologies.
<P>
But the Ellonians were also done in by their own
wasteful agricultural practices.  Their farming drove
most other advanced species into extinction, and
heavily stressed natural habitats.  Most of the
surviving wild regions were driven into remote arctic
and subarctic climes, regions that were destroyed by
the advancing ice sheets.  Their agriculture destroyed
by shifting climates, and unable to adapt to their new
climate without the species they had destroyed, the
Ellonians were first starved out of their settlements,
and were decimated by famine, disease and warfare.
Eventually their gene pool diminished below genetic
survivalbility, and they slowly faded away over 10,000
years.
<P>
Despite Elloni's wealth of ancient ruins, the world
was never a high priority for development.  Ice sheets
cover what had been the richest and most productive
land before the ice age, and the remaining land is
generally non-arable.  Plus the extensive bogs and
marshes create massive amounts of CO2 and methane that
clog the lower levels of the atmosphere in a dense,
poisonous haze. The wet climates also create ripe
conditions for breeding of poisonous and parasitic
microfauna that make travel through the temperate
latitudes dangerous during the summertime. The world's
location on the spinward border opposite Mnemosyne
does not attract much trade anyway.
<P>
Aside from the tour and academic research groups
travelling to the world, the world has few independent
sources of income.  Most of the population is
considered to be "wild", runaways that have managed to
scrounge for a living despite the world's terrible
climate and poverty.  Most of these are organised as
farmers and herders in the equatorial zones, though a
hardy few subsist on the edible crops they raise in
the marshlands.  These marshlanders cultivate the
local peat bogs, which are rich in unusual compounds,
which they harvest for sale to offworld pharmaceutical
firms.
