Isurkun was the site of major antebellum industrial
investment by the Vilani megacorporation Naasirka. The
huge assembly plants it constructed were abandoned in
1121, and remain vacant and rotting to this day, and
are referred to as the "elephant graveyard." The major
unemployment caused by this pullout nearly caused the
world to be abandoned, but the local oligarchy secured
enough offworld investment to create new enterprises,
and Isurkun prospers once again. The association with
the Vilani led to a strong emphasis upon education,
and Isurkun has the highest percentage of college
degrees of any world in the Regency. The locals run a
number of small liberal arts schools that are in high
demand for training of teachers and university
instructors.
