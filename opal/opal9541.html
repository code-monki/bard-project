Zivijie is a high population world despite its
inhospitable atmosphere. Considerable resources
attracted major corporate and Imperial investment as
early as 420, and its industry and population steadily
grew throughout the Antebellum period. During the
Fifth Frontier War, the world became the farthest
trailing advance point of the Zhodani invasion force,
being the site of bitter fighting that almost went the
Zho's way. The repulse of these forces held up the
Zhodani invasion of Rhylanor subsector, and they were
crushed weeks later at Rhylanor by reinforcements from
Corridor Sector, being the decisive victory that led
to the successful prosecution of the war.
<P>
The world's seemingly oppressive government and law
level are reflective of the stress of maintaining
infrastructure and life support on this world. In
actuality political debate is free and flowing, and
criticism of the government is tolerated. Political
office is open to any meritorious individual. The laws
merely reflect the stringent environmental regulations
and containment laws that keep the population alive.
The local infrastructure is excellent, and the locals
put a high emphasis upon educational attainment. The
starport is home to the Naravisji Planetary
University, which is a former extension program of the
Glisten Institute of Planetelogical Studies (GLIPS).
Terraforming projects carried out by both institutions
have not profited, and the world remains under heavy
study in hopes of future transformation of the
atmosphere.
<P>
The system itself contains a number of orbital
facilities, many constructed since the Collapse. The
oldest and most prominent of these is the Marrestie
Orbital Arcology around the gas giant Zivijie VI. The
arcology is the exclusive domain of the mainstream
Church of Stellar Divinity, and its 468,000
inhabitants are not very solicitious of visitors.
Other facilities include the Hirogiri Stellar
Observatory, and the Golden Mean Arcology, which is
the headquarters of the Zivijie Planetary Navy and
COACC forces. Sternmetal Horizons maintains a number
of orbital industrial facilities, and its presence
insystem is second in size only to its Regency
headquarters in Rhylanor.
