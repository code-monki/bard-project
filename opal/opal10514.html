<P>

Piah Subsector is named after the very bright A4II
star at Piah (2135).

The J-1 Avalar Corridor connects 13 worlds in Piah,
Harem and Python subsectors. Lypkytan (1739), Tewupo
(1738) and Epepazap (1840) are a part of the Avalar
Corridor.
<P>
Piah was once the technological jewel of the
Consulate, thanks to the high level of development on
Tewupo (1738). Since the Collapse, Tewupo has lost its
technological lead to nearby Avalar and Milne, despite
its oppurtune location along the Coil.  This is
attributed to the increasingly heavy hand of its
ruling council, and its narrow minded pursuit of its
own edification over more profitable and communally
enriching ventures.
<P>

<P>
Two of the worlds in Avalar Space are the former
Kamrathi League worlds of Kulse and Merghy. In the
past, only experienced traders took the shortcut
through these worlds from Urnian subsector to the
heart of the Avalar Consulate, diverting via the old
Kamrathi League, through Xenough subsector to
coreward.
<P>
The reason for this traffic flow was a lingering
conflict between several non-aligned worlds and the
Consulate government. Several worlds resisted Avalaran
attempts to annexe them, and often launched attacks on
Consulate shipping.
<P>
The worst of these confrontations was with Shortcut
(2335).  Possessing a strategic position along the
main trade route through the middle of the subsector,
Avalar spent years trying to coerce the locals into
Avalaran allegiance.  Despite frequent raids on the
world by Avalaran naval and privateer forces, the
local ruling council resisted through piracy and
smuggling. After the Collapse, Shortcut became the
target, with Avalar complicity, of a number of
Enterprise attacks in the 1150s, decimating its trade
and forcing it to submit to Prewitt's control. It is a
major Enterprise base in rimward Foreven.
<P>
At Weepo the Avalars had a Naval base that customarily
inspected almost every ship that enters the system.
This is done to prevent smuggling, and the spreading
of piracy into the Avalar Consulate. It is now the
primary Quarantine base within the Piah, and the main
entrance port for vessels intending to ride the upper
Coil from Avalar into Beyond and Vanguard Reaches.
<P>
Ukardi (2236), Iptete (2334) and Ronsk (2433) were
made Avalaran client states, with their reluctant
approval, by the Avalars in 1131 in anticipation of
making them member worlds. Unfortunately, this gave
encouragement, and created a forward base, for
Consulate mischief in Urnian Subsector.
