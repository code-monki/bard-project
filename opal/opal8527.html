Formerly known as Sisi. The superdense atmosphere of
the world is a pressure cooker that reaches densities
of 200 to 300 atmospheres in the lower canyons and
gulfs.  The world is owned by the Erarzong
Corporation, a locally owned company that makes its
money off of mining and industrial operations in the
worlds depths. The entire population lives on the
world's single moon, Roughzez, and never actually
alights to the surface itself. Instead remotely
operated probes and vehicles are parachuted from orbit
into active exploration zones, and are operated by
controllers on Roughzez or orbiting vessels. Collected
mine and factory products are carried on conveyors to
mass drivers or huge elevators for pickup by special
shuttles.
<P>
Erarzong has a long history of friendly relations with
the Third Imperium. The company feels fortunate that
it was annexed into the Regency, and the world is
highly accessible to Regency naval and quarantine
personnel. The local population does not tolerate the
presence of the Vargr Pack, and it is one of the few
Frontier systems without a significant Pack presence.
