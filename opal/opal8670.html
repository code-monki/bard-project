Aziziyah is not a true high population world, but is
included because it will become one in the next thirty
years as a result of the Askigaak Abandonment. Before
the Collapse Aziziyah was populated by feuding mining
and fishing communities. Despite a wealth of
resources, conflicts between miners and fishermen
often boiled over into low level wars over contending
property and exploitation rights. None of these
conflicts ever escalated beyond pushing and shoving,
and the Third Imperium showed little interest in the
world. The locals lived in scattered island
communities of a few hundred people each, posting
heavily armed mercenary guards to prevent raids by
their neighbors.<P>

After the Collapse the locals created a unified
government, and began to solicit closer ties with
nearby worlds. It exported most of its ore to Askigaak
for processing, and a close relationship blossomed
between the two worlds. This relationship culminated
in negotiations completed in 1197 that would make
Aziziyah a colony of the more heavily populated
Askigaak, and allow more living space for 'Gaak
citizens. In 1201 the first work crews arrived to
begin construction of several new underwater
arcologies that will hold some ten million people when
they are completed by 1209.
