Prefecture was another victim of the Escape Clause.
The world was chiefly a refuelling stopover for
vessels, and possessed few important industries or
redeeming resources. Despite this, millions of people
inhabited the world just prior to the Imperial Civil
War, crowded into small underground settlements. Civil
fighting earlier in the world's history left the
government in the hands of the self styled "Sublime
Prefects" otherwise known as the Carrack family.
<P>
The Carracks imagine themselves the enlightened
successors to traditional Chinese or Japanese
despotism, and rule their world in an oriental manner.
To reduce tensions between themselves and the masses,
most of the population is divided into seperate wards
organised according to economic specialty. To rule the
seperate districts a warrior class known as the
Fermata was created. The Fermata are a mixture of
Mandarin and Samurai, and replenish their numbers from
the general population through civil service
examinations and combat training. The world has no
seperate military, as the Fermata are expected to
train their own militias with their own resources.
<P>
The local society is best described as a militant
socialist fuedalism. Opposition to the regime was
muted by strong cultural taboos against dissent, and
co-optation of dissident elements. Unfortunately this
arrangement did not work very well economically, and a
sizeable minority has been permitted to emigrate to
Pikha and Ishiri to work and make money for their
homeworld.  Some Fermata have petitioned the Carracks
to permit them to join the Oklahoma Land Rush into the
Wilds, to found colonies that would further the
interests of the homeworld. It is rumored that the
Sublime Prefect is stongly leaning towards just such a
project, and will give her permission.
