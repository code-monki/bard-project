Kryslion is an old Long Night era colony that was
recontacted by the Third Imperium around 408. Most of
the system's huge population is crowded in a series of
linking arcologies around the world's polar seas. In
the past these were a twisting warren of dilapidated
buildings and poorly maintained utility conduits.
Investment and technological upgrades have permitted
the modernization and replacement of many older
structures with new state of the art arcologies,
though a large portion of the population, particulary
the poor, still live in the old arcos.
<P>
Kryslion is vehemently Free Soil. Few Aslan immigrants
have ever managed to stay here in the face of
harassment, both official and private. While the world
has avoided entanglement with other Liberation Armies,
its own Anti-Aslan policies are by far some of the
most repressive in the Thinrim. The planetary
dictatorship is widely unpopular with the masses, and
these policies are designed with the intent of
redirecting popular anger from itself towards a
convenient target. "Bleeding Cyan" is but a parsec
away, and has become a rallying point of government
encouraged extremism.
