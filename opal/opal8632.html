Shen-Yang (Spirit of Light) was settled in the second
century by Taoist monks from Solomani space.  Because
of their libertarian mindset, the Shui-he (Harmonious
Water) sect eschews most kinds of onerous legal
prohibitions or complicated government structures.
Committed to their practice of Wu-Wei philosophy, they
seem little affected by the winds of offworld
politics, indeed they seem to thrive on them. Natural
population increase among the monks, and immigration
of people attracted to the world's tranquility,
allowed it to expand beyond the monastery and become a
productive if rather ordinary seeming world.
<P>
For centuries an obscure agricultural world, two
developments since the Collapse has made this world
important.  For one thing its philosophical and
religious practices have become very popular for an
interstellar mainstream in a state of spiritual
starvation and introspection at the beginning of the
1200s. Taoism is actually less a religion than a
mystical philosophy, a guide into practical living
that never decisively answers certain question, and
seems the least likely candidate to attain mainstream
acceptance. But its emphasis on the individual, its
strong ethical code and personification of the sacred,
and its idea that life is the meeting the
circumstances of an individual(fate) and their morals
and principles (destiny) has made this world a mecca
for coreligionists and ordinary citizens seeking an
answer for this new era of doubt, skepticism and
uncertainty.
<P>
The other development is the discovery that the monks
of Shui-he were concealing a major Ancient site. Known
as the Valley of Souls locally, it is really a set of
building foundations left behind after planetary
bombardment annihilated the city it was supporting.
Finally revealed by the monks in 1154, excavation by
the Regency government and private expeditions have
found very few new artifacts of technology of
significance. But they did find thousands of graves,
occupied by the remains of various Droyne of all
castes.  Apparently the Shen-Yang Ancients developed
ornate burial rituals, and their deceased were
interred in magnificent tombs under their city. This
is a double coup for xenoarchaeologists, who
previously went without the kind of grave goods so
essential to their work with other ancient cultures,
and it personalises the Ancients while undercutting
the pernicious amateur treasure-hunting that has
always afflicted their field. The site remains under
the control of the monastery, and attracts hundreds of
thousands of tourists, researchers and Droyne each
year.
