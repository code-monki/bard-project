Saarinen is the fifth moon of the local gas giant,
Unagashin. High surface temperatures discouraged
colonisation, as immigrants found more inviting worlds
in nearby Rhylanor subsector. Because of its lack of a
population beyond starport staff, the Third Imperium
established Deneb's Research Station Epsilon in the
world's outback in 806. Epsilon is dedicated to
genetics research, having been established at the
behest of institutions like the Ministry of
Colonisation, the Scout Service and a number of
private and public corporations. Its charter prohibits
it from engaging in geneering work that deals with
sentients, and experiments on animals are severely
regulated. Most of its work then is in genetically
modified plants, fungus and microorganisms.
<P>
The station is located about 1200 km (770 miles) from
the downport, in a remote valley, shielded from casual
observers by 8000 meter (25,600 feet) tall mountains.
The facility itself is a sprawling affair, consisting
of barracks, containment domes, and wide expanses of
cultivated and fallow fields. The station is protected
by tight security, and large areas near it are posted
off limits and patrolled with aircraft. Allegations of
secret military experiments dogged the facility for
centuries, and rumors of major accidents emerged from
time to time as well.
<P>
In 1132 the new Regency government revealed that the
facility was a clandestine biological warfare
laboratory, and demilitarized the facility. Its
mission was converted to commercial and civilian
research goals, the civilian workforce was increased,
and Epsilon became closely affiliated with
universities on Rhylanor and Magash. A number of
private biotech companies from the "Rainbow Vale" on
Magash were allowed to set up shop around the station,
in many cases these were nearly as large as Epsilon
itself.  The old research company was supplanted by a
represenative council, though one biased towards the
corps and smaller offworld government agencies now
present on the planet.  Critics charge that by
privatising the station, its old practices of abuse
and secrecy have metasisized, and unscrupulous biotech
companies now play god in the fields of Saarinen
without stringent government oversight. Security for
the world is still very tight, and reports have
surfaced of offworld critics being subject to
intimidation by local agents.
