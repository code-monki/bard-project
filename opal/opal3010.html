The people of Schotz have great pride in their starport as it represents
a prime source of revenue and trade for the planet. They fear the Hivers
will take over the starport with their superior technology and more
cosmopolitan ways: so they have refused to lease them any land.
The hivers have decided to perform a manipulation on the planet to
quietly alter their view of the Hivers and allow a permanent base of
operations to be created. Led by M. Gringoire, the hivers are using
Schotzan agents and propaganda to alter the views of the Schotzans,
mainly with the younger generations. However, this process will take
time: several years at best. The hivers have created a temporary base on
a small moon orbiting the gas giant. The base acts as a
refueling/support point for Hiver ships passing through the system.
