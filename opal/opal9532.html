Roget was first settled by the pre-Maghiz Darrians
around -1375. The world was perfectly situated within
their comfort zone, and it had abundant potential for
agriculture.  Within the next three hundred years
Damu, as it was then known, had attained a population
of about ten million, and its foodstuffs were in high
demand on Daryen and its neighbors.  It's proximity to
the homeworld made it an early casualty of the Maghiz
shockwave, and the world regressed back to a TL of 5.
Because of its export dominated market, the locals
were suddenly very poor, and forced to rely upon local
subsistence for their survival.  A schism resulted
that divided the world into several mini-states, and a
slow population die-back resulted from the growing
isolationism that seperated these states.

<P>
Roget was the second world to be recontacted by Mire in
-275.  By that time the population was barely half of
what it was before the Maghiz, and the various nations
were so badly divided that recovery was nearly
impossible. While quickly readmitted to the restored
Confederation, its reconstruction was not a high
priority, and the world languished while its neighbors
effected their own reconstruction.  The remaining
Darrian population saw an increase in their numbers,
thanks to improved health care and some offworld
immigration, yet they remained bitterly balkanised and
utterly incapable of helping themselves, and this
attitude caused other Darrian worlds to heap scorn and
indifference upon them.

<P>
When the First Frontier War erupted in 589, the
Darrian military was in a poor position to fight it.
While the Confederation Navy was quite competent, the
ground forces were inadequate to the task of fighting
Zhodani and Sword Worlder forces, and a number of
battles were lost due to their deficient performance.
The answer to the problem came from an unlikely
source.  A number of Aslan Ihatei had come across the
Great Rift with the intent of serving the combatants
in exchange for land of their own.  A Darrian
delegation met with several of Ihatei groupments, and
struck a deal that offered Darrian territory in return
for their permanent loyalty to the Confederation.

<P>
The deal was accepted, and four Aslan clans, the
Eeakyo, Ftoaliy'ktai, Oakteiyetlaw and the Yeyuteil,
immediately commited their forces against the Outworld
Coalition, and then against the Sword Worlders. So
successful were these troops that the Confederation
expanded their reward, giving them Damu, now renamed
Roget ("Gift") as recognition of their sacrifices
against their enemies.  The decrepit human states were
abolished, and the surviving Darrian population were
made vassals of their new Aslan overlords. The world
has been a home to increasing numbers of Aslan Ihatei
ever since, and a source for most of the
Confederations most elite infantry and special forces
units.

<P>
The Aslan population of Roget shows the least signs of
integration into the Confederation, and are considered
to be "Other Aslan" by their fellows in the Hierate.
The Four Clans have been unanimous in upholding, as
faithfully as possible, the traditional Aslan cultural
and honor codes, and this loyalty has tested their
bond to the Confederation at times. Many other
non-Rogetian Aslan have spurned this cultural loyalty,
and have integrated fully into Darrian society, and
controversy with the Roget Aslan has been a frequent
occurence. Younger members of the Four Clans have been
unmindful and downright contemptous of the polite,
nonviolent nature of Darrian society, and were vocally
supportive of other Aslan Ihatei during the Imperial
Civil War period.

<P>
Nevertheless, the taint of Darrian culture has
increasingly sharpened the distinction between the
Four Clans and their brethren, and Te-zlodh has
increasingly supplanted Trokh as the language of
business and day-to-day life, especially among lower
class Rogetian Aslan.

<P>
Roget's economy recovered quickly after it was given
over to the Aslan, and it currently is the
Confederation's largest food producer.  It's food
surplus has been a major reason for the governments
tolerance of the most egregious Aslan behavior in the
past.  The world's main export is grain for shipment
to Yelim and Daryen itself, and enough income is
generated for nearly the entire population to be
prosperous.  Other markets have been slow to develop,
and the Four Clans have shown disinterest in new
economic development.

<P>
The Four Clans are actually four different
governments, with little in common other than a
Tlaukhu-like body to remedy problems and intervene in
disputes.  The entire world, save for the starport, is
divided between them, down to the lowliest human.
Passage between these territories is strictly
controlled, and permission must be granted by a tao at
the least.  The power sharing agreement enforces
parity among the clans, with no clear dominance by
just one.  Their relations with Mire and their own
Daryen vassals have been more lopsided. Generally, the
human population has preferred the Oakteiyetlaw clan,
even though this clan has been the most conservative
in its outlook. The Confederation government has
quietly preferred Eeakyo in its dealings, but has been
careful to keep that support covert, fearing the
consequences that would occur from disclosure.
