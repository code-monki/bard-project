Asharam was colonised by a back to nature sect of
Vilani traditionalists in 788. Technology was
maintained at pre-industrial levels, except for
communications and power generation. This group
colonised a number of garden worlds in the Rift during
antebellum times, including Garden/Alone (Reft 0435).
It recieved some trade from Imperial space, but its
people were more content to survive on the hardy crops
they planted. The world was virtually unscathed by the
Collapse, though a large portion of the population was
evacuated during the Abandonment.
<P>
A large influx of Vargr refugees from Corridor flooded
the world during the late 1130s, causing a breakdown
in social order. The current government is a feudal
assemblage of lords, both human and vargr, who keep
their people as serfs on their estates. Laws outside
of these regions are virtually nonexistent, and petty
wars are often waged in the outback. The world is
ruled by a king who still nominally recognises the
Regency, and trade missions are sometimes mounted
under the auspicies of the RQS.
