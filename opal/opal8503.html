 Kennebec was the target of an attack during the
Ancient's Final War. A weapon of unknown design
devastated the northern hemisphere, buckling the crust
and venting a large amount of poisonous gases from the
mantle. 300,000 years later, a significant amount of
outgassing continues, shrouding the world in a
yellow-brown haze that requires a heavy duty filter
mask and sometimes a full protective garment against
irritants. The attack created conditions for a series
of ice ages that have only abated in the last 30,000
years, and significant amounts of land are still
rebounding from load created by glaciation.
<P>
The world has a very wet climate, and massive
downpours can flood low lying areas. Most structures
are built on stilts or other man-made elevations, as
much of the local terrain is very susceptible to
landslides. The land is covered in thick forests and
extensive swamplands that limit overland travel.
Despite being settled for nearly 230 years, large
sections of the world remain unexplored except by
orbital imaging.
<P>
Kennebec's main industries are all connected with the
local oceans.  The seafloor is a rich source for
metals, and is harvested by submersible mining
platforms that spend months at sea dredging up the
nodules. An important second industry is the harvest
of certain varieties of edible local sealife, which
are raised in mobile seafarms for eventual culling and
export to markets on Starn and Ashasi. Most of these
industries are rather labor intensive, as unemployment
is anathema to the local culture; but they all require
long stays at sea or at least away from the main
landed settlements. The local culture then is
intentionally divided into a working "class" that toil
in the world's main revenue industries, and a domestic
"class" that takes care of the world's children, and
manages the ancillary bureaucratic and support jobs
that keep the mining and aquafarming fleets in good
running order.
<P>
The local Ancient site is the ruined remains of what
appears to be a massive dome structure, located deep
in the outback.  Aside from the architecture, there
are few spectacular artifacts to have been found, but
there are a few mysteries. No support structure seems
to have held up the dome or its attendant structures,
but there is no evidence that it used CG lifters of
any kind. Even more interesting is that evidence
exists that it actually flew, telling from local
impact evidence. The purpose and internal layout of
this facility are a mystery.
