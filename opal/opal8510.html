 Kirklend was one of the few worlds to gain population
 by the Abandonment.  A pleasant world noteworthy for
 its abundant game and fishing, many of its communities
 are self sufficient in terms of power and food, and
 were constructed either underground or in regions of
 natural fortification like dense forests or
 cliffsides. These barricades helped the world
 withstand heavy Vargr raiding during the Civil War
 period with negligible damage, and this strength
 attracted refugees from less habitable worlds like Ash
 and Spectre.  The possibility of Vampire raids did
 compell the disparate communities to form a unified
 government in the wake of the Rape of Trin, though.
<P>

 Kirklend was a resort world in the antebellum period.
 The local game and large tracts of undeveloped
 wilderness attracted hunters and sightseers from both
 the Domain of Deneb and the nearby Vargr Extents. Most
 of the population worked in the tourist industry,
 either in hotels hear the sumptious starport, or in
 hostels or outfitting firms that served the large
 "safari" trade. The Collapse brought major offworld
 immigration, in contrast to most other Frontier
 worlds, and the tourist industry has been supplanted
 with small manufacturing and service industries that
 cater to the growing population and the local Naval
 and RQS cadres. The local shipyard has become a major
 manufacturer of cheap jump-1 traders and spacecraft
 that are major export items to the Vargr Splinters and
 the Regency Safe.<P>

 Kirklend's communities are heavily fortified and fully
 self contained. All power, life support and
 infrastructure is provided and maintained locally.
 Most are constructed underground, and each has a
 committed force of paramilitary police organised to
 defend the community against Virus. These communities
 are connected only by air, either grav vehicles or
 slow moving zeppelins, and roads and railpaths are
 nonexistent on the world. The locals zealously patrol
 the outback for pirates and smugglers, and the local
 courts are severely punitive against interlopers or
 offworld miscreants.
 <P>
 The leader of the Assemblage of 1116, Arruna Kosghaele
 Zal, had been a frequent visitor to Kirklend before
 the Imperial Civil War, and personally forbade corsair
 raids against the world or its supporting shipping,
 thereby preserving the local economy. Zal's
 infatuation with the world culminated with its seizure
 by his forces in 1133, and its naval base was
 instrumental in his invasion of the Regency a year
 later. Zal and his family are buried on Kirklend, as
 Virus and political turmoil on his homeworld prevented
 the return of his remains. The dominant local Pack
 Goenghoedz is a branch of the Ngorsraek, specially
 committed to preserving Zal's memory in hopes of
 reclaiming his homeworld and the state that he had
 formed.
