Ikhaba was settled by Naasirka and Zirunkariish as a
joint venture colony in 980. Despite a weird ecosystem
that expelled high amounts of nitrogen that reacted
with the copious solar radiation coming from the M5III
primary, the world had abundant natural resources, and
the two companies set up several factories to take
advantage. The primary, renamed Zagashki, attracted
the attention of Stellar Divinity believers in both
company's workforces, and the local congregation had a
significant voice in local affairs. During the Civil
War, the companies pulled out of the world in the
famous asset swap with Hortalez et Cie, but most of
its workers and their dependents elected to stay on
the world. The Church eventually became the primary
power on the world, and convinced its core believers
into staying on the world during the Abandonment. The
Church is still in power, though its rule is very
benign, and its provides enough food and shelter to
retain the allegiance of the population.
