Dinpholasy is a beautiful T-Prime world that was
settled by the Kamrati League in the late 870s. The
world had mild weather, good soil and a diversity of
climates. Because of its potential as an agricultural
producer, the League settled it with small collective
farms, each of them dedicated to a different region of
the world, and committed to a different crop or kind
of agriculture.
 <P>
Overseeing the world was a centralised Commissarate,
that set production quotas, monopolised offworld
transport, and controlled the purchase of offworld
equipment, fertiliser and seeds needed by the farms to
survive.  Unfortunately the Commissarate became the
domain of petty, corrupt and incompetent bureaucrats,
many of whom were assigned here on the political whims
of the reigning Agriculture Ministry on Lenin.  Price
manipulation, petty oppression, theft and utter
incompetence quickly soured the relationship between
the farmers and the government, leading to defiant
acts by the populace.
 <P>
In 952 the planet suffered from an economic depression
in conjunction with official mismanagement, and it
erupted in rebellion.  The Commissarate was destroyed,
and many of its petty officials were hunted down and
either humiliated into leaving, or executed.  Aided by
arms exports from <A href="opal9308.html">Urnian</A>, the locals soon had enough
firepower to seriously harm a League intervention
force, and Lenin decided that discretion was the
better part of valor and accepted the fait accompli.
 <P>
Unfortunately, the rebels proved incapable of forging
a unified government, and disputes over land and power
devolved into small guerilla conflicts between fueding
collectives.  By 1000, the world was more or less
evenly divided into two dozen warring "kibbutzes",
each dominated by popular militias, that traded a
sizeable proportion of their agricultural output to
Urnian in exchange for the weapons they needed for
security.
 <P>
The absorption of the Kamrati League by the Avalar
Consulate in the 1090s meant that it inherited the
problem virtually unabated.  The Consulate moved
deliberately, acting only when it had an oppurtunity
to inject its authority in the space between the
factions, and assert itself as a neutral peacemaker.
The Collapse temporarily upset these delicate
manuevers, as the price shocks created by the
Quarantine hit the worlds commodity markets hard,
leading to an escalation of violence between desperate
militias.  (This in turn upset the Consulate's
attempted landgrab in spinward Urnian subsector.
Forces assigned to seize Ipmokyng and Okunpamsk were
instead redirected to Dinpholasy to stabilise the
situation.)
 <P>
Since 1150 the Consulate has imposed a new centralised
bureaucratic government upon the warring kibbutzim.
Overt warfare has mostly ended, the world's economy
has stabilised, and it is again safe for offworlders
to travel between rival kibbutzes without being shot
out of suspicion, and the linkage between the world
and Urnian has been severed.  But the factions are
unreconciled to each other, and order is only
maintained, as on <a href="opal9307.html">Lune</A>, by large forces of Avalar
peacekeepers.  Withdrawal of these forces have so far
proven impossible, especially as the Militias keep
undermining the Consulate's authority with illegal
contacts with offworld criminal syndicates.
