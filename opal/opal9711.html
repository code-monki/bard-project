Colchis has one of the most divided populations of any
world in the Islands, with the exception of Amondiage.
The world was settled by smaller utopian groups that
had travelled aboard the C-Jammer, but were incapable
of integration with the mainstream colonists of New
Home.  These groups opted to head into space once
again after the planetary government constructed a new
generation ship to carry them. After arriving on
Colchis, disparities between groups led to conflict,
and for most of the period leading to contact with the
Serendips after the Third Frontier War, the world was
divided into warring states that fought over
economics, resources and ideology.  Several socialist
factions were driven offworld, and one of these
settled New Colchis.
<P>
Unification was dictated by the new paradigm of jump
drive equipped enemies.  But that unification was only
made possible by the importation of troops, materials
and money provided by several offworld powers, most
notably Serendip, Joyeuse and New Home.  The ascension
of a capitalist free-trade oriented bloc helped cement
ties with New Home, and a low-level war broke out
between the "Republicans" and Pro-Joyeusean
"Nationalists-Redeemers."  During the Islands War, the
Republicans were exhausted by civil war, and the world
drifted towards Joyeuse.  New Home launched an
invasion of the world in 1127, and its forces have
been mired against rebel forces ever since.  The
occupying forces are limited to fortified bases and
the major cities, while the countryside has been
plunged into anarcy. The population has long tired of
the fighting and disorder, but are bedeviled with
guerilla armies cum crime blocs, police spies and an
occupying government that is an absolute terror to
friend and foe alike. While not amber-zoned, visits to
Colchis by offworlders are rarely recomended.
