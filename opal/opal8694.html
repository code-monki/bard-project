Formerly known as Pashus. The world was originally a
specially funded experimental colony that housed
scientists and engineers working on the cutting edge.
Overshadowed by Deneb's Research Station Zeta, a
number of other labs and research institutes carried
out other groundbreaking work in the antebellum
period. After the Rape of Trin, it only became natural
for the world to be chosen as Denebs second naval
depot. Compared to Depot Alpha, Beta is a more laid
back place. Less emphasis is given over to production,
and more to research and development. The world's
previous emphasis upon science has carried over to the
modern day, and "geeks" are the most visible and
influential in running the world, despite its military
importance. Large areaa of the world and its adjoining
system are offlimits to civilians, as important
research in weapons and viral countermeasures are
conducted in several facilities.
