The hereditary Dukac family recieved the world as a
hereditary fief in 904, and owned the title to the
worlds highly productive farmland. The Dukacs are
practitioners of a back-to-nature religious sect, and
are loathe to open up their land to any kind of
development. This led to clashes with their subjects,
and gradual introduction of oppressive laws. For
centuries the family enjoyed enough Imperial support
to keep its population in line. The Representational
Reforms raised the spector of insurrection, however,
and a consensus now exists between the Dukacs and
their citizens that leaves the world an unspoiled
paradise, but allows for enough technological
advancement to allow the local population to prosper
without major pollution. So despite the high law
level, Wroclaw has avoided the problems of its
neighbor, Barbary (0327).
