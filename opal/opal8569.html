Berth obtained its name from the huge joint naval and
scout maintenance stations that dominated it. Because
of its strategic location on the interface between
Deneb and Corridor, most ships transiting from one to
the other stopped here for inspection, certification
and normal mainetenance. The allure of these
facilities proved the world's undoing, and it was
conquered by the Dzaargh Federate in 1116. Domain of
Deneb forces raided the bases in 1121, inflicting
heavy damage. The bases were finally destroyed by
Virus infection in 1143. The local Vargr population
fled the main settlements, and wandered in the
wilderness for about twenty years. In 1163, a Virus
infected Titan class Dreadnought wandered into the
system after making a sublight journey from an unknown
point of Corridor, and crash landed near the former
base sites.  Curious Vargr soon contacted the
Puppeteer strain virus that controlled the ship, and
soon began following its orders.
<p>
The Puppeteer, which called itself "Blackblade"
shrewdly manipulated the Vargr into thinking it was a
god, and used their services in an attempt to obtain
spare parts and maintenance. Eventually it began to
respect its "pets" and compelled them to reunite into
community around it. Under its tutelage the local
Vargr reattained agriculture and a semblance of
industrial technology. Unfortunately, an RQS force
visited the world in 1170, and destroyed Blackblade's
CPU from orbit with carefully aimed meson gun bursts.
The violence of the attack had the effect of
radicalizing the Vargr. Blackblade's viral eggs have
been carefully preserved by its believers, who make
every attempt to infect appropriate technology in an
effort to spread Blackblade's "word" around the
universe. Past attempts to infect free traders has led
to the world's isolation, and the Regency government
is at a quandary over what to do with this world.
