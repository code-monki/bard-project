Ghatsokie is homeworld of the Crenduthaar minor race.
The Crenduthaar are a mammalian-like centauroid
species that evolved from predators native to the
hotside of this tidally locked world, fearsome in
appearance but actually quite pacifistic and gentle in
demeanor. Most of the Crendu live in loose family
structures that roam the hotside, gathering food and
materials for survival.<P>

The Vargr minority live in colonies scattered
throughout the twilight zone of the planetary
terminator. These were originally a religious group
known as the "Followers of Auugh", but are now
dominated by the descendants of refugees that fled
here during the Collapse. The relations between the
two groups are hostile, with the Vargr often enslaving
Crendu to work at menial or backbreaking jobs in their
communities. Crendu often retaliate through terrorist
raids upon their communities, or by simply killing
every Vargr they encounter. During the Civil War
period, a group of offworld agents and Crenduthaar
known as the Uvryuashgis would run the Vargr blockade
to bring in supplies to aid Crendu resistance, and
would often rescue and evacuate formerly enslaved
Crendu back to the Domain of Deneb. The organisation
has been terminated because of Quarantine
considerations, but sympathetic sophonts in the RQS
still check up on these gentle giants, and sometimes
slips stuff "under the table" for their use.
