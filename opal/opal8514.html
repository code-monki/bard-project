Formerly known as Teh. The world's small population
was no match for the Vargr invaders that landed here
in 1121. The invaders were an extremist nationalist
group known as the Sons of Oekhsos, inspired by the
Anti-Imperial tirades of the Utovogh. The Sons were
accomodated by the Regency, and the now Vargr
dominated world was declared Fait Accompli. The
Collapse, and the true revelation of Oekhsos' nature
robbed the group of its overall reason for existence,
and attacks by Pack gangs from other worlds undermined
its leadership by 1155. The main settlement was
abandoned in 1153, and the population has split into
semi-nomadic groups that subsist upon herding and
fishing.
