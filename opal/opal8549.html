In Antebellum times, Jurburk was a backwater, a
whistle stop for merchant ships moving down the Midway
to more settled areas of the Domain of Deneb. The
original B-class starport was maintained for cheap
refuelling, but the world itself was largely ignored.
After the Collapse its remote location and scout base
put it into the Regency Frontier as an important
sentry against Vampire incursions. With the opening of
the Regency Frontier, the world has become one of
several designated as Quarantine terminals for trade
and passengers moving into and out of the Wilds. The
above listed population are mostly transient
construction workers building a new starport
expansion.
