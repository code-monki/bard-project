Laberv was settled by Pre-Maghiz Darrians around
-1380. A smallish agricultural world, it was chiefly
exploited for grazing and minor truck farming. The
colony did not attract very many colonists, and it
died out after the Maghiz.
<P>
The world was resettled by colonists from Mire after
-128, but it struggled to maintain a profitable
existence.  Harsh taxation by Mire did little to help
the situation. Many local traders took up smuggling
and other illegal activities to circumvent these
punitive measures, and to provide an additional source
for income.  Crackdowns by the Confederacy government
merely drove these racketeers underground, and they
proved nearly impossible to root out.
<P>
Despite misgivings about the syndicate, Laberv
received its independence in 609 as a cost cutting
measure by the Confederacy government, leaving the
local population completely at the mercy of the
racket.  The syndicate quickly expanded its operations
in defiance of the planetary government efforts, and
brought the world to a virtual standstill. They were
prevented from interfering with interstellar traffic
moving through the starport by the Darrian military
and the fear of stronger, lasting intervention, but
the farmers and townspeople native to the world were
not spared. The syndicate had extensive contacts with
unsavory elements in the Sword Worlds, and may have
provided intelligence and material support during the
Frontier Wars in return for financial aid.
<P>
Protection rackets and "taxation" became the main
means of harassment.  Most of the planets businesses
and operating companies were partially or wholly owned
by the syndicate, and it was impossible to get a
service rendered or employment without paying
additional fees or usurious contractual obligations.
The pervasive harassment eventually drove a sizeable
proportion of the population out into the unsettled
outback, where they were isolated from offworld trade,
but free from the syndicate as well.
<P>
The end of the Sword World threat after the 1132
Landgrab cost the syndicate its offworld patrons, and
allowed the Confederacy to concentrate upon internal
domestic issues without distraction.  An alliance was
ratified between the government and Laberv's outback
population, and a joint military operation overthrew
the planetary government in 1136.  The local
industries were nationalised under a new planetary
government, and law enforcement surveillance was
tightened.
<P>
A new participatory government was constructed to
permit the population to directly act against the
syndicate, and to keep in constant communication with
the authorities.  Suffrage is universal, and voting is
mandatory.  This not only makes it difficult for the
population to be intimidated, it also acts as a veiled
threat of constant surveillance, as voting patterns
are constantly analysed to detect syndicate members.
