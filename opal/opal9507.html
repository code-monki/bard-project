 <P>
Retief, formerly 975-452, was settled by the former
Imperial Megacorp, Hortelaz et Cie, in the last few
years before the Civil War. The company surreptitously
constructed a large facility, and maintained a low
profile colony on the world.  Its reason for doing so
is still largely unclear, but it is widely believed
that it used the world as an "offshore" banking
center, as well as a contact nexus for the company's
intended expansion into the Spinward Hinters.

 <P>
Despite its poor starport, or perhaps because of the
low profile its mediocrity afforded it, the company
built an extensive complex of support, recreation,
conference and supply facilities to house and maintain
staff and workers. While not exactly luxurious, the
base was more than comfortable enough that it became a
rest and recreation facility for its personnel,
particularly in the contact and intel offices.
Hortalez compensated for the lack of starship
maintenance facilities by stationing a tender on a
periodic basis in orbit, disguised as a company bulk
carrier.

 <P>
Bankrupted and destroyed by the Collapse, Hortalez was
liquidated in the Great 1132 Fire Sale, and most of
its former managers seized or absconded with many of
the company's extra-Imperial holdings for their own
personal profit. 975-452 was the most extreme example
of this piracy.  Local company personnel simply
declared "independence" from Hortalez as a real
sovereign world, and the world's facilities were
spared a trip to the auction block.  The new managers
encouraged immigration, constructing schools and
medical clinics and other amenities required to
attract and hold new arrivals and their families.

 <P>
Now bereft of its mother company's money and support,
the new government transformed the world into a
outside contact and commercial center (and black
market nexus) between the Regency and its neighbors in
the Hinters.  The world sustains itself as a
middleman, dealmaker and diplomat, and it makes a good
profit and reputation for itself as a side benefit. A
number of small shops and factories have sprung up in
the last couple of decades, primarily to produce spare
parts for megacorp systems that are outdated or
out-of-production since the Collapse.

 <P>
The world has few distinguishing features in of
itself. And the colony, now open to every and all
visitors, seems to be rather ordinary.  Yet that
ordinariness, a visitor quickly realises, is just an
outgrowth of the facade that Hortalez maintained for
itself.  There is a lot going on behind the scenes
here, and the unwary visitor quickly learns to become
circumspect with the locals, whther they have
important information or not.
