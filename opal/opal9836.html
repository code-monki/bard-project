Most of Browne's population abandoned the world in the
1130s. Isolated by the Quarantine, the world's
industries were threatened with economic collapse,
leaving little choice but to emigrate for the Regency
or Hierate safes. For those who remained, the offworld
emigration led to a substantial increase in living
standards, as the now vacated arcologies had ample
room even for the couple billion who stayed.  Most of
the worlds orbital and dirtside farms remain in
service, and substantial exports are shipped to other
"Crosshair" worlds and even the Aslan Hierate. Those
not engaged in farming or manufacturing are supported
by the remittances sent back by the emigrants and
their children, who anticipate returning to the
homeworld when the Quarantine is lifted, and hire
their neighbors and relatives left behind to watch
over and maintain their old residences and property.
