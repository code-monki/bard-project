<A href="http://members.aol.com/dedtravllr/sectors/beyond/">UPPs and maps for Beyond Sector</A><P>

One warning: None of the following is canonical.  I
started playing Traveller long after Paranoia Press
went out of business, and their map and info on
Vanguard Reaches probably included an overview of the
Corellian League.  All of the following is my own
doing, with a lot of inspiration from William Keith's
Gateway Sector campaign.
<P>

<h3>Sector Overview</h3>
Beyond Sector was for most of its
history a distant backwater.  Located far behind the
Great Rift on the opposite side of both the Ziru Sirka
and the Rule of Man, no serious settlement was
attempted until the Long Night.  Solomani colonists
fleeing hardship and chaos made their way across the
Great Rift in a number of waves between -800 and -150,
waves that included the seeds for the later Darrian
and Sword World nations.
<P>
It was settled in four great waves:</B> Nakris, Corellian,
Garronean and Meizirnian.  After the rise of the Third
Imperium, two more waves, Florian and Marrekeshite,
added their numbers to the sector's already diverse
population. And in the 500s, Aslan Ihatei began
settling the trail-rim corner of the sector. Despite
its rich worlds and untapped resources, the sector was
still rather isolated from the Imperial or Zhodani
mainstreams, and most of the settlers had to rely upon
their own devices for development. Only with the Aslan
Ihatei invasions of the pre-Collapse period, and the
Spinward Accords, did Beyond become even marginally
important to the rest of Charted Space.
<P>

Traditionally, the states of Beyond were non-aligned
in the Imperium-Consulate conflict.  Privately most of
the sectors Solomani descended inhabitants loathed the
Zhodani, and often attacked Consulate shipping out of
their own volition.  The Imperium was respected but
irrelevant to the political situation of the sector.
The Aslan were either feared or respected, or both, as
the local clans were (and still are) divided into
warring factions most of the time.
<P>
The main powers in the Sector are the Corellian League
and the Federation of Garrone, two states that have
clashed for centuries for political dominance over the
sector, and the Aslan, who make up a trifecta of
conflict and intrigue.  The Regency is a distant
power, whose main role is in keeping these powers from
restarting their disastrous Pre-Collapse war that left
much of the rimward part of the sector a ruin in
places.

<P>
<B>Barchai Technium/Leviathan Lines:</B>  Company founded
before the Fifth Frontier War to develop trade with
remote and unexplored worlds in the Trojan Reach,
Foreven and Beyond Sectors.  BT started out with a
handful of ships and a lot of ambition.  Its crews
included IISS veterans, and their experience in
contact allowed BT to make steady inroads into the
closed markets of the Reach and Beyond. Spearheaded by
its proprietary Leviathan class freighters, the
company ventured far into the Spinward Hinters,
helping to develop the J-2 route that became the Gold
Road.
<P>
But its trade became a casualty of the Civil War.
Aslan ihatei overran most of its Trojan Reach trading
area, and disrupted its operations in Beyond Sector as
well.  The pullout of Makhiduran in 1119 allowed it
absorb the Vilani corp's remaining personnel, purchase
most of its BTC assets, and gain its client base. And
with the demise of Tukera Lines, BT acquired a
sizeable fleet of ships and a number of modern
maintenance facilities in the Marches.  The company
renamed itself Leviathan Lines in 1135, after its
famous freighters, and has turned itself into one of
the Regency's premiere shipping companies.  Most of
its focus remains interface service between the
Regency and the Spinward Hinters.
<P>
<B>Blood River:</B> The worlds of Burgundy (1614), Carmine
(1516), Cerise (1617), Cinnabar (923), Crimsom (1618),
Flame (1522), Ruby (1718), Sanguine (1917) and
Vermillion (1716).  These worlds were contested in
bloody battles in all three Blood Wars, and numerous
peacetime skirmishes, and were renamed to reflect
their sorry heritages.
<P>
<B>Blood Wars:</B> AKA the Corellian Wars or Beyond Wars.
These were military confrontations between the
Corellian League and the Federation of Garrone for
supremacy over Beyond Sector.  Three wars were fought:</B>
618-622, 980-997 and 1105-1111.  Despite massive
investment in lives and equipment, all three wars have
been strategic stalemates, with only minor exchanges
of territory, and no advantage to either side in their
struggle for political and economic dominance.
<P>
<B>Earthquake:</B> Reference to the massive demographic shift
and population movements in the Federation of Garrone
instigated by the Pharoah's Plague.  After the release
of the plague, some thirty billion Garroneans fled the
affected worlds for the coreward Federation. This led
to a baby boom in the overcrowded resettlement camps
that further strained local resources.  In many cases
local governments broke down and had to be replaced by
local military and industrial chieftains, and led to
more repressive laws within the formerly liberal
Federation.
<P>
<B>Gold Road:</B> Jump-2 route wending through Beyond,
Foreven and Vanguard Reaches Sector. Name derived by
Regency traders in Plankwell and Five Sisters
subsectors that profit immensely from the flow of raw
materials brought from Spinward.
<P>
The Gold Road is actually three seperate jump 2 routes
radiating out of Urnian/Foreven and the Avalar
interface. One route goes to Mnemnosyne to the Duchy
of Treyln, then heads to rimward towards the Murians
and Iphigenaia Sector. The second route wends through
the Union of Meizirn, and either reconnects with the
first route at the Treyln border, or continues down
through most of the Corellian League. The last route
goes from Urnian, through the Marrekesh Trade League,
down through the Avalon Isles/Byrna interface, and
finally down into Aslan space.
<P>
The Route was originally developed by Barchai Technium
(now Leviathan Lines) in the early 1110s. When the
Quarantine was erected in 1132, the Regency needed to
keep inflation from wrecking its tightly controlled
markets, and that meant trade for vital raw materials
to keep manufacturing prices down. Under an agreement
signed in 1136, Leviathan Lines and Aster Nova, a new
heavy freight hauler, were given special licenses to
operate in Beyond under less stringent Quarantine
requirements. Their ships were merely required to
submit to detailed inspections every six months,
though they were not permitted to reenter the Regency,
transferring their cargos to interface haulers at the
border.
<P>
<B>Oracles:</B> Information firm located on Python/Beyond.
With the network nature of Beyond Sector emerging in
the Post-Collapse period, reliable information became
a must for Regency and Darrian corporations operating
in the region.  The Oracles were organised in 1141,
and is a vast network of couriers, information
consultants, networkers and analysts who collect,
organise and disseminate, via a sector wide network of
informants, information in a timely and thorough
fashion. The company also has a number of psions on
its staff, mostly telepaths and clairvoyants, with a
few precogs that are heavily guarded by the company's
security services.
<P>
<B>Pharoah's Plague:</B> The massive release by the Garronean
government of anti-Aslan chemical and biological
agents on ihatei occupied worlds in 1129-1130.  The
agents were mixed into a complex "cocktail" consisting
of viral and bacterial agents and chemical radicals.
Their effects ranged from severe discomfort, to death.
On most of the worlds they were released, these agents
killed or maimed millions of ihatei, allowing the
Garrone military to quickly reclaim these worlds
without much fuss.
<P>
The backlash from this atrocity was immediate.
Neighboring governments condemned and isolated the
Federation.  The Aslan were incensed, and the
Federation was only saved from retaliation by the
fortuitous arrival of Virus in the Aslan Hierate.  But
the greatest damage was done to the ecosystems of the
liberated worlds:</B> many of the agents interacted with
the local ecologies in a destructive manner, and
affected local human communities as well.  The ecocide
led to the demographic Earthquake that saw about
fourty percent of the local population leave
elsewhere.  Most of these worlds are still affected by
the long term effects of the Plague.
<P>
<B>The Rand:</B> Geographic term that refers to Post-Collapse
Five Sisters and Plankwell subsectors in the Spinward
Marches Sector, specifically those portions within the
Regency.  The region recieves its name from the
massive amounts of trade, much of it vital mineral
wealth, that passes through its ports, to and from the
Spinward Hinters. The term also refers to the nouveau
riche inhabitants of worlds like Mirriam and Karin
that have replaced the Five Sisters traditional
military and ecologist culture with a new economic
order.
<P>
<B>Regency of Muirimi:</B> Remote Spinward Hinter state in
Iphigenaia sector.  Settled by Solomani colonists in
the last decades of the Long Night.  The Muirimians
are perhaps the most remote human community in Charted
Space, abutting against the uninhabited worlds of the
Hinters.  Until the Aslan colonised Touchstone Sector
in the 1060s, their nearest neighbors were the Nakris
Confederacy. The reason for their remote existence is
tied with a complex history of religious persecution,
and they  have a reputation for isolationism.  Most
pre-Collapse contact came by way of the equally remote
Nakris Confederacy, whose old trade ships made
occasional trips down to the Regency.  A few hardy
souls from other parts of Charted Space made the long
trek to what they termed "Tibet".  The Post-Collapse
period has been hard on them, as Aslan Ihatei and
refugees flooded into trailing Iphigenaia, upsetting
their notions of harmony, and forcing them to deal
with the outside universe.
<P>
<B>Rococo:</B> Collective name for the Stromatolite-like
algae of Avalon/Avalon Isles.  Like Stroma, Rococo are
colonial lifeforms that create large "rocky" isles to
protect themselves from a harsh maritime environment.
But where Terran Stroma created silica-based
structures, Rococo create a variety of structures out
of Lime or Dolomite extracted from seawater, thereby
creating a buffer that protects them from Avalons
highly acidic seas.  Rococo gets its name from its
adaptability, creating a wide variety of colonial
shapes based upon local conditions.  Besides being the
basis for many of Avalon's larger cities, the locals
have learned how to adapt several species to their own
use, creating a cheap source for building material.
<P>
<B>Spinward Hinters:</B> Post Collapse name for the region
occupied by small Human client states adjacent to the
main powers Behind the Claw.  Includes any sector BTC
that is not affiliated with the Regency, Aslan, Vargr
or Zhodani.

<P>
<h3>Political and Diplomatic Data</h3>
<P>
<B>Astell (905):</B>Independent world-state in Python
Subsector. Astell is at a main chokepoint of the Gold
Road, a strategic position it carefully exploits.
Because the majority of Corellian J-2 trade must go
through Astell, it can use its large navy and the
threat of alliance with another power to preserve
their independence against League aggression.  Its
navy consists of a large number of surplus Regency TL
13-14 cruisers and destroyers, and a squadron of TL 14
escorts on "loan" to the Regency navy.
<P>
Astell is not a client state, but warm relations with
the Regency makes it attractive to corporate and
private citizens, and the world is the primary base
for most Regency commercial activities. The world
hosts the Regency sector embassy, and the TAS sector
office.
<P>
<B>Corellian League:</B> The Corellian League was established
shortly after the Imperium began settling the Spinward
Marches.  Composed of Solomani who travelled to Beyond
Sector around -140, the League was originally a
defense pact.  The local culture was very militant and
aggressive, and despite a weak central government, the
League expanded steadily to rim and spin.  Early
clashes with the nascent Federation of Garrone in the
300s led to a longstanding rivalry, and frequent
skirmishes by both sides over borders and markets.
<P>
The League has always been a militant society.  While
historically democratic, power had been carefully
delineated along the lines of a military command
structure.  Military service was mandatory, and much
of the most abled veterans were retained as an
inactive reserve for times of war.
<P>
With Imperial power and influence limited by the
Zhodani, the League made a cursory alliance with the
Imperium, but charted an independent course of their
own that made their neighbors nervous.  By the 800s,
the League was the largest and most powerful of the
Client States, skillfully squeezing in between both
the Consulate and the Imperium, and taking advantage
of their standoff.
<P>
The breakup of the Imperium in 1116 upset that balance
of power, and attracted Aslan Ihatei to Imperial
territory BTC.  When the Domain of Deneb stalled the
Aslan advance in 1121, newly arrived Ihatei looked
elsewhere for land, and many were diverted to Beyond
Sector.  At first exultant over Aslan advances into
the Federation of Garrone, the Corellians were taken
aback when Ihatei began making an end run around the
Federation, towards the Nakris Confederation and their
own Rimward colonies.  Despite a number of determined
Aslan invasions, the League just barely drove the
Ihatei away from their main territories, though their
colony enclave to rimward was mostly overrun.
<P>
When the victorious fleet commander Admiral Ebba
Nazari returned to Corellia in 1132, he and a number
of military officers, aided by local business
interests, overthrew the governing Coordinate Council,
and declared a national emergency.  The League
Constitution was suspended, and local autonomy was
usurped, except for the industrial worlds that
supported Nazari's coup. Nazari voided most local
sovereignty, replacing planetary governments with
Emergency Council appointed governors, backed by
military police and naval interdictions.
<P>
These business interests embarked upon a major
modernisation effort, supported by the Emergency
Council, that led to the League reaching Tl 15 by
1175. Their efforts recieved a major boost from the
Regency's Representational Reforms, as the League
offered homes and investment oppurtunities for
displaced Regency nobles, who used their money,
resources, knowledge and contacts to assist their new
countrymen.
<P>
The Corellian people are themselves divided by the
events of the past 70 years.  The newer regions of the
League, especially in Vanguard Reaches Sector, are
openly rebellious, while those in the traditional
heart of the League believe that the Emergency
Council's efforts are necessary given the League's
backwardness and the intractability of its enemies.
<P>
<B>Dagonite:</B> Psuedoreptilian sentient species native to
the world of Eisya'akh or Dagon (1034). The Dagonite
were first contacted by the Nakrisian humans early in
the Imperial period, and trade between them became the
basis for the founding of the Nakris Confederacy.
<P>
The Dagonite are descended from semi-aquatic
Omnivore/Eater ancestors.  They are colonial creatures
that live in colonies burrowed out of moist soil,
composed of tunnels that twist and turn for
kilometers. Their social interactions are complicated,
a reflection of their constant attempts to assert
their group standing.  As such they do not form firm
family associations, preferring to deal with the group
as a whole.
<P>
Dagonites are huge (2.2m) hexapeds.  They possess
serpentine, flexible bodies covered in overlapping
armor plates.  They have powerful claws for digging
and killing prey alike.  They are air breathers, and
are extremely sensitive to industrial pollution, which
has limited their advancement.  They also prefer
darkness, and many Nurturers are agoraphobic.  Their
night-vision is excellent, as is their sense of smell.
 Dagonites are not known to possess any kind of
psionic abilities, though they have no difficulty with
other creatures having such abilities.
<P>
The Dagonite are divided into three sexes:</B> male,
reproducing female, and nurturing female. The young
are born live, large litters of 20-30. Like the
Hivers, the Dagonite young are not considered to be
sentient, and are expelled into Dagon's wilderness to
fend for themselves. The surviving young are brought
back into the community, and are raised and mentored
by the nurturers.  Dagonite society is caste based,
primarily between professions and secondarily between
sex, and its is the nurturers task to determine the
potential of the young, and put them into their proper
place.
<P>
Nurturers are considered casteless, forming a
leadership class that is entirely self contained. They
are recruited from the ranks of the Reproducers, whose
own members study intensively in hopes of becoming
Nurturers someday. Nurturers limit their numbers
through pheremone secretions that supress the
expression of genetic traits within other normal
females:</B> the death of a nurturer signals other
reproducers to begin developing. Usually there are
more than one new nurturer, and the candidates must
compete before their new peers, in tests of strength,
judgement and knowledge; the loser is put to death.
Nurturer politics are complicated to the point of
opacity.
<P>
When they were contacted by the Nakris humans, the
Dagonites were stuck at TL 3.  The Nakris provided
non-polluting technologies that jumpstarted their
development, and they reached TL 12 by 1100.  They
had, and still have, close ties with the Nakris, and
their curiosity made them somewhat xenophilic, though
they rarely travelled beyond either their homeworld or
the Nakris Confederation.  The current Ihatei
occupation of their homeworld is a lamentable turn of
events, though they made an alliance with the
Tralyaeaewi clan, and they are caught in a ascending
spiral of warfare with the Aokhalte clan and its
allies.
<P>
<B>Florians:</B> Collective term for two "alien" species
native to Yggdrasil/Floria/Trojan Reach, created by
the Ancients using human genes as a template.  The
Florians consist of the brainy but weak Barnai, and
the muscular but unintelligent Feskals.  Despite the
disparity between them, the two species coexist
peacefully, guided by strict ethical standards that
prevent abuse of one group by the other. The two
species cannot interbreed with each other, and exist
in a state of symbiosis.
<P>
Both species exhibit traits that indicative of their
former servant status:</B> stoicism, contentment and
conformity.  Pure research is shied away from, and
true innovation is almost unheard of. What science the
Florians do possess came from Ancient artifacts the
aftermath of the Final War, where they had to survive
on their own without assistance.  Despite their poor
suitability for research, the dogged determination
usually suceeds at creating technical breakthroughs,
though these are usually the result of copying someone
elses technology.
<P>
The Florians attained jump drive from a wrecked Aslan
ship, and began expanding into surrounding space in
-170. Contact with the Imperium came in 185.  The
Florian League was established in the 506.  Government
consists of councils of Barnai chosen by lottery among
their population.  Traditionally, the League has been
aligned with the Imperium, and a warm relationship
continues with the Regency.
<P>
The Florians suffered the loss of three worlds to the
Aslan during the Civil War period.  One of these,
Vadada, was a TL 15 industrial world.  The Florians
strongly desire to liberate their fellows, and
relations with the Aslan are cold and distant.  Their
relations with their other neighbors are less
consistent, though their free trade policies make them
a center of commerce in both the Trojan Reach and
Beyond sectors.
<P>
<B>Nexus:</B> Refers to a worlds that has disproportionate
influence at the interstellar level.  Most Nexuses are
usually industrial worlds, whose economic importance
and/or strategic positioning make them an important
center for trade and the concentration of power and
money.
<P>
<B>Nexus-State:</B> A polity centered around a Nexus. Most
such states are just either the main world, or the
main world with one or two vital colonies. Their
independence is maintained by through the goodwill of
larger powers, and their own economic pull.
<P>
<B>Sago:</B> Strange alien species native to Plusker (214).
When the world was first surveyed in 488, the
explorers discounted them as non-sentient animals, and
the world was slated for colonisation. Only by the
chance participation of a IISS exchange officer were
the creatures' sentience determined, and the world was
interdicted.
<P>
The Sago are small (0.8m) bipeds. They have large
heads with massive, pupiless eyes. They have slick,
rubbery skin like a terran frogs, and chameleon color
mimicry ability.  They have no external orifices for
eating, breathing or waste excretion, all of those
functions being done through various parts of its
epidermis. They are equally home in water and dry
land, though they prefer wet environments.  Normally,
the Sago do not show outward signs of culture,
language (they communicate through low frequency
sounds created by gas release under the skin) or
intelligence, explaining the Corellians original
mistaken impression.
<P>
The Sago are TL 0 on their own, and have shown no
signs of advancing beyond that. Most of their
population lives individually in small burrows, and
most of their cultural interaction takes place
underground or underwater.  Sexually dimorphous, their
means of reproduction are still a mystery.
<P>
<B>Corncobs:</B> Nickname for the huge modular freighters
made possible by the adoption of Icing technology.
While Icing made it easier for larger cargoes to be
carried by spacegoing vessels, it was still only an
incremental approach to the problem.  Mamano Lift
engineers then came up with the notion of a modular
displacement hull dramatically different from previous
designs.  Using a needle or open frame hull with
oversized engineering systems as the central
framework, several layers of specially designed
containers were spiralled around the ships axis, in
excess of the frames own displacement.  For structural
reasons, the new displacement did not exceed that for
a cylindrical hull of equivalent length. The net
result was a freighter, assuming j-4 performance, that
went from 0.55-0.58 cargo by displacement, to
1.45-1.62 times the original frame displacement.
<P>
<B>Devil Pups:</B>  Pirate organisation founded by Imperial
military deserters in Koan subsector/Beyond Sector
after the Third Frontier War.  Most of these deserters
were officers deposed by political infighting within
the Imperial military bureaucracy, or military units
disgraced in the wake of the Third War debacle.  These
units made a home on the Stern and Defiant diad, and
channeled their military skills into racketeering,
piracy and mercenary work.  A number of its members
became legitimate businessmen, with strong ties to the
main organisation through a network of shadowy
economic connections.
<P>
The Devil Pups were fairly typical in size and
organisation, and their main distinction remained was
their continuing attraction as a sanctuary to
disgraced Imperial nobles and military personnel.  The
Imperial Civil War and the Ihatei invasions changed
that.  The quality, organisation and equipment of
Imperial deserters improved dramatically, and its
leadership became dominated by men and women tested
and sharpened by their adversity in war and subsequent
flight.  The Ihatei invasion of Koan subsector drove
out the Devil Pup's competition, and gave the pirates
a unique oppurtunity.  Through carefully arranged
alliances, duels and daring military raids, they
managed to tie up the invading clans, and forced the
Lakht Aorlakht to recognise Stern and Defiant's
independence.
<P>
Protected by their alliance with the Hierate, the Pups
ruthlessly eliminated their opposition, and created a
vast network of economic and political connections
across Beyond, Trojan Reach and Vanguard Reaches
sectors, from the Aslan border to the Zhodani
"Shadow." A covert network of agents extended into the
shattered Imperium, rescuing sympathetic people, and
recovering military and industrial equipment to build
up SD against future aggression.  In the wake of the
Collapse, they increased their reach into legitimate
industry, turning the organisation into a
"crime-conglomerate" of linked legitimate and illegal
activites.  The Pups continue to be the main power in
SD, but also have huge sway on Prewitt and in the
Avalar Consulate.
<P>
<B>Eheen:</B> Intelligent, aquatic species native to
Sarabande in the Federation of Garrone.  The Eheen
vaguely resemble Terran Horseshoe Crabs or Trilobites
in appearance, except that they have an internal
skeleton. The Eheen are oceanic bottom dwellers,
descended from Omnivore/Eater ancestors that burrowed
through the top layers of the ocean floor sifting for
food. <P>

The Eheen are very sophisticated at creating, refining
and using tools.  Their artisans, engineers and
mathematicians are highly sought after.  Early in
their history they began using underwater vents for
metalworking, and were at the underwater equivalent of
TL7 when they were contacted, an accomplishment that
included unique computer technology.  All of this is
the more remarkable given that they are not a very
sociable species, even with their own kind.
<P>
Even their most fervent human supporters classify them
as a race of "grumpy, old curmudgeons."  Proudly
individualistic and territorial, in the past Eheen
would frequently deplete their food sources, and had
to constantly move around looking for more.  Often
they would intrude into another Eheen's feeding range,
and fights would erupt. What social interaction they
do have is often the result of screaming necessity,
where mutual self-interest forced two or more fueding
Eheen to set aside their differences, and from such
alliances came much of their technical advancement and
diffusion.
<P>
Over time their society evolved into a complex array
of social contracts, and of negotiation between
seperate individuals.  Interaction with them consists
of having to deal with convoluted organisations of
interested individuals, each with one feeler in every
pie, and each with their own stake, which makes
relations with them thorny and time-consuming.  They
are not very receptive towards outsiders of any kind,
except where they might have useful abilities or
contacts they lack themselves.
<P>
<B>Federation of Garrone:</B>  Federated state located in
astrographic center of Beyond Sector.  Garrone and the
surrounding worlds were colonised between -600 and -80
by Solomani refugees, mostly of Western European
ethnicity.  Confrontations with the Corellians led to
the creation of the Federation in 313.
<P>
Unlike its neighbor, Garrone was a centralised state
from its founding.  Centered around an oligarchic
council known as the Conclave, it created a unitary
policy for industrial development and education that
gave the Federation a high standard of living.
Strictly neutral, it encouraged the other powers to go
elsewhere with their conflicts.  Its wars with the
Corellians were over commercial and political
dominance of the sector, though the Garroneans spurned
the Leagues' tendency for expansion in favor of more
subtle economic methods.
<P>
The arrival of Aslan Ihatei in the Federation in the
wake of the Imperial Civil War was dealt in an inept
and disorganised fashion. Garronean military planners
had always counted on good relations with the Aslan,
and were concentrated to fight the League on the
spinward border.  For about five years, the Conclave
dithered in creating a resolute response, and by that
time the Aslan were beginning to assert themselves
with force.  In a panic, the Federation attempted a
massive use of biological and chemical agents. The
military attacked the Ihatei communities with aerial
spraying, or contaminated food and water.
<P>
Ninety percent of the Ihatei perished, but the release
of the "Pharoah's Plague" backfired catastrophically,
contaminating local ecologies with deadly, foreign
agents.  This led to a massive flight of the "rescued"
rimward populations to the coreward half of the
Federation, creating the demographic Earthquake.
Careful diplomacy, genuine Conclave contrition and the
overriding need for peace have kept the Aslan from
ever retaliating for the plague.
<P>
<B>Icing:</B> The use of solidified Hydrogen, stored in
external mountings, as jump and reaction mass.  Fuel
is the largest consumer of space aboard a ship, with
even a j-1 ship giving about 50 percent of its
displacement to fuel tankage.  With each one parsec
increase in jump range, comes a corresponding six
percent drop in capacity, to the point that jump 4
through 6 ships are unprofitable for large scale
trade. Since most of the ships fuel mass is going to
be consumed by the process of jumping, it will arrive
at its destination with huge, empty, and unprofitable
fuel tank.
<P>
But in the 1150s, the engineers for a new Regency
freight line called Mamano Lift, resurrected an old
idea first proposed by a Solomani scientist long
before jump drive:</B> an ice rocket. An ice rocket
doesn't have a fuel tank, rather its frozen fuel IS
the fuel tank, which is consumed with the fuel itself.
 Unlike the methods needed to obtain MMH (Metastable
Metallic Hydrogen) freezing hydrogen is easier and
cheaper, and only requires a suitable freezing medium
in order to become profitable.  Earlier attempts at
lower tech levels relied on lasers for cooling the
fuel mass; but Mamano Lift relied upon a derivative of
military Black Globe technology to freeze huge masses
of fuel.  To this company engineers added a damper
field to compact the fuel mass, further enhancing
performance.
<P>
An "Icy" is generally a needle, open frame, cylinder
or sphere configuration hull.  Around the axis of the
hull are large circular aprons, to which the fuel mass
is affixed.  Finally, simple toroidal shields made of
metal protect the fuel mass against ablation by
magnetic fields or solar wind.  When the vessel jumps,
the entire fuel mass is instantly converted to
creating a jump field whose dimensions are based upon
displacement MINUS the now consumed fuel mass, giving
unheard of jump performance for large cargo vessels.

Besides revolutionising freight haulage at a time when
the Regency needed it, the military applications of
this technology were also decisive.  Icing military
ships before they manuever and jump away for hostile
territory permits them to preserve their internal fuel
tankage unused, meaning that an attacking task force
no longer has to refuel when arriving insystem, and
can avoid the defense forces that lie in ambush in gas
giants or water bodies.  It also permits longer ranged
patrols into rift areas.

<B>Spinward Metropolis:</B> Replacement name for the term
"Behind the Claw."  First appearing in the 1170s, the
name reflects both the fact of the spinward regions
survival and therefore preponderance of industry and
population compared to the Wilds, and the fact that
the term Behind the Claw is a vague and confusing term
that reflected the self-absorption and arrogance of
the Imperial Core.  The full term is mostly academic
in use, and common people rarely use any term to refer
to this side of the Rift; preferring to use, in a case
of turnabout, to contrast the "Wilds" or "Imperial
Wilderness" to their own secure, comfortable state.
<P>
<B>Zhodani Shadow:</B> Name for a twenty parsec zone around
the Zhodani Consulates rimward borders.  Inspired by
the heavy pressure felt by non-Zhodani culture states
from the size and sophistication of the Consulate.
Term is also used to describe the Consulate's
none-too-subtle military and intel activities within
neighboring sectors.
