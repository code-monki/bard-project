The Grudovo Pendant is a j-1 cluster of 13 worlds that
connects Tobia/Trojan Reach with neighboring
Usher/Reft. Originally a cluster of little economic
presence or importance, its economic value has risen
in proportion with the rising volume of trade that
passes between Lintl and Tobia.<P>


<P>

The local human-Aslan communities are well integrated,
the result of shared privation after the Regency's
reclamation of the world. Most of the world's drinking
water requires heavy filtration as a result of
microbial contamination, and the filtering equipment
was destroyed during the Ihatei invasion. The ihatei
were supplied from offworld sources, but that failed
as Regency forces advanced into occupied regions.
Aldaya is being prepared for future colonial
expansion. Despite high surface temperatures, the
world's relative emptiness has caused a number of
interested offworld parties to agitate for its opening
to further settlement.
