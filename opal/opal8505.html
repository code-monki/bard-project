Reims was colonised in 657, after the main ship of a
colony fleet en route for Sabine subsector was forced
to make an emergency landing. The ship was damaged
beyond repair, and had been carrying most of the
fleets industrial machinery and heavy construction
equipment. Unable to salvage the ship, or secure new
transport for its cargo, most of the colonists
shuttled down to the surface and made Reims their
home. Arguments over ownership of the downed ship
eventually broke the colonial leadership into seperate
factions. The original equipment has been replaced
several times over, but the worlds industrial base is
still concentrated around the main crash site, and is
owned in common between all of the many states.
Violence is anathema to the local populace, and
weapons are banned. Nor does sovereignty guarantee
sanctuary, for fugitives from one state will be
arrested and automatatically extradited if they flee
to another.
