As I studied the core of the Merchantile Guilds area of operations I noticed several things. First, the data used to collapse Diaspora
sector was the 1124 data, The data for 1129 was not used. This led to some interesting anomalies. For instance, one planets population
drops 75% in five years, then quadruples after the collapse, back to the precollapse population. On another world, the Chirper population
did the same thing, mysteriously drops then increases or in one case disappears and reappears. Still, this is useful. Some starports drop
in the 1124-1129 era, only to reappear in the 1201 data. I propose that the one that show and increase are good candidates for guild
starports, especially on low population worlds that otherwise only have low value as trade centers. On higher population worlds, where
technology levels remain fairly elevated and some relic ships or facilities can reasonably be expected to exist, Guild presents becomes
more problematic.

<P>

Shadigi Subsector has thirteen worlds with human or droyne/chirper populations. Total population is 850 million, about what Oriflamme
has but 150 million are Chirpers on Ninja (0415). Highest Tech level is 8 at Mosul (0111) and Ninja. The best starports are class D at
Karaguuka (0116) and Khuugar (0518). Highest population is 400 million at Mosul.
<P>
<B>Mosul</B> (0111) E5868BB-8 401</B>. Mosul is one of the rare planets that has prospered since the collapse. By 1129 the Tech level had dropped
to TL7 down from the 1124 level of 9. By 1201 TL is back up to 8. While the pre-collapse starport was a class C facility, the current port is
class E but verges on class D and may be upgraded in the near future. Mosul sees a large amount of traffic as it provides access to the
high population world of Bayse (0310) and links to the Shadigi Main.
<P>
<B>Toga</B> (0113) X674269-1 312. Toga only has around 300 inhabitants living just above the stone age level, by 1124 TL was 0 and population
was 800. Traders don't come to Toga as it's precollapse TL never exceeded 5.
<P>
<B>Ainor Lisea</B> 0114 X77756E-4 B204</B>. With a population on only 200,000 on a balkenized world few traders visit this world. The guild has
made some efforts to contact the local TED.
<P>
<B>Karaguuka</B> 0116 D789674-5 C3 B114. Before the collapse Karaguuka had a chirper population of 180 million, and 20 million humans. By
1129 the population had dropped to 2 million with no chirpers known to exist. By 1201 the human population had dropped to 700,000 and
300,000 chirpers are now known to exist , however they have degenerated to a most primitive tech level. Early in 1175 the Guild contacted
the planet and re-opened the ruined starport. It is now a Guild run facility.
<P>
<B>Ninja</B> 0415 E6648BE-8 C5 B303</B>. Ninja's population is evenly split between humans and Chirpers. However the chirpers have been
reduced to little more than slaves. Before the collapse Ninja was owned by Terra Far and while the planet is now "free", it still belongs to
Terra Far.
<P>Ninja is a heavily balkanized world, which was on the brink of war over resources at the foundation of the
     UWA. Ninja becomes a leading light in the UWA and one of its dominant powers, or rather the two predominant
     Hinja states do.  (Editor's Note: The UWA is part of the story detailed in the forthcoming e-novel <cite>Diaspora Phoenix</cite> by Martin Dougherty.)
<P>
<B>Terra Far</B> 0416 X444668-4 Ag 613</B>. The 6 million people living on Terra Far are held under the power of a TED. But not the usual type of
TED. This ruler rules not through fear or with Relic weaponry. This TED rules through the Drug Morandmor. A locally grown plant the
metamor is refined into the drug morandmor, however the refining process is preformed through high tech means. The TED controls the
refinery which produces morandmor and therefore controls the population. Recently the Guild contacted the TED and as he/she was in
desperate need of repair parts for the refinery they negotiated with the Guild to supply morandmor through the guild. This has been quite
profitable for the Guild. Terra Far has a moderate military government, and is fairly friendly to offworld trade.

<P>
<B>Kosmo</B> 0417 X54976A-4 503</B>. Kosmo's 50 million people are ruled under the iron fist of the planets TED.
<P>
<B>Cuttack</B> 0418 E275599-5 Ag 610</B>. Since the collapse Cuttack's population has dropped from 800,000 to 600,000 and it's TL
has dropped from 7 to 5.Cuttack supplies food to both Ninja and Terra Far. Cuttack is a nasty religious dictatorship, which controls technology and imposes sexist policies as well as a
     harsh rule by Inquisition enforcers.
<P>
<B>Ferry</B> 0512 X64776A-6 Ag B903</B>. Ferry see's little traffic as it is out of the way. The Guild makes occasional stop, supplying the
TED's with high tech supplies. Before the collapse Ferry was a major supplier of TL12-14 military craft, particularly grav vehicles
and fighters. The Guild would like to get it's hands on the factories and tooling need to produce these vehicles.
<P>
<B>Niilushaga</B> 0516 X77358D-4 B403</B>. Niilushaga sees little traffic.
<P>
<B>Khuugar</B> 0518 D68756A-6 Ag 215</B>. The 200,000 people on Khuugar Live and agrarian existance. The Starport is wholly owned and
operated by the Guild.
<P>
Two other worlds in Shadigi have incidental human populations without starports or facilities.
