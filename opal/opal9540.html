 Chris Griffen wrote
a good version of Rhylanor as written some
years ago. However a few details are
changed for my version. Rhylanor's tech profile is
changed to read FF-HGGFH-GGGG-FH to better reflect the
Post-Collapse period (CG's profile is better
understood as being antebellum) but also the progress
of research on Rhylanor in the last seventy years. And
while private robotic firms on Rhylanor have been
forced to shut down, the Regency and subsector
governments have retained several such facilities for
their own use.
<P>
Rhylanor is home to a cluster of Regency facilities
once known as Plants 7 through 10, but now referred to
as the Rhylanor Quadrilateral, which produces an array
of TL 15 and 16 goods for Regency military and
paramilitary forces. The world's high tech
infrastructure is buoyed up by a number of higher
learning facilities, including not only the University
of Rhylanor and RIT, but fellow "Ivy Curtain"
insitutions like Lyonesse University and Pendahar
College, all of which have a heavy grounding in
technical sciences and technocratic management. The
ROSS facility has been supplemented by a number of new
private orbital starport facilities known as RALFS
(pronounced 'Ralph') or Rhylanor Auxiliary Facilities.
<P>
The world is the primary Post-Collapse headquarters to
a number of prominent firms, including Sternmetal
Horizons, Blackhawk Enterprises, Ginga Transport,
Prynnde Metals, Astroburgers LRC, the Tukera family
affiliated Lightbearer Lines, and JAX/TCP.
