Miwald is controlled by a semi-oppressive government
known as the Protectorate. It is a relic of the
Rachelean Revolts of the 1010s, and was established
after the lamentable events on Saki (Deneb 0306).
Miwald had been a lawless freeport and haven for
pirates, and the removal of these criminal elements by
the new government has permitted its survival long
after the Revolts had faded from memory. The
Protectorate has a sizeable fleet of SDBs and armed
inspection craft that bolsters the Scout Base, and
stringently inspect vessels arriving insystem for
contraband or virus infection. The economy is
dominated by component and parts manufacturing in
support of Pretoria's economy.
