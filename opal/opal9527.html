 Stern-Stern was not one of the original Pre-Maghiz
colonies of the Darrian Confederacy, but was settled
in the aftermath of the First Frontier War.  The
system, then known as 247-461, had originally been
bypassed due to inadequate surveys, and except for a
starport, had been ignored by the Confederation and
its economic planners.  The world was cursed with a
very thin atmosphere, and possessed few obvious
resources that would make it attractive to outside
settlement.
<P>
This changed after a Sternmetal Horizons survey
discovered in 576 that the world had extensive
deposits of Iron, Nickel and Aluminum in large ore
bodies buried under its extensive plains. Military
tensions and conflict with the Zhodani, and the
massive initial investment outlays required for
subsurface mining delayed colonisation until 603, and
the Second Frontier War delayed actual explotation of
the deposits until 625.
<P>
Sternmetal, with assistance from the Darrian
government, sank several deep shafts, some of up to
10kms deep, to reach the ore bodies.  In doing so, the
company had to compromise safety.  The digging of deep
shafts, in an atmosphere under severe underground
pressure, on a world with very little air pressure to
begin with, was a dangerous and expensive undertaking.
Death due to the bends, or blowouts at the surface
level, claimed a number of lives, and gave the world
an unpleasant reputation. Sternmetal soon suffered a
labor shortage, as skilled mining workers developed an
understandable reluctance to work in the mines.
<P>
As production dipped, Sternmetal approached its fellow
megacorp Naasirka for assistance in automating the
world's production.  Through a seperate holding
company called Sternmetal Automation, the two
companies pooled their efforts and constructed a huge
network of automated factories and mining complexes
for extraction, processing, refinement and machining
the mines output for eventual export.  These complexes
were probably the largest robotic factories ever
constructed in the Marches before the Collapse, and
still rank among the largest still extant.  These
facilities was the pollution they generated as a
byproduct of various mining and industrial processes,
but the two Sternmetal divisions (which is where the
world name originates) profitted enough to pay their
employees very good wages and continued to deliver
massive amounts of vital metals to both the Third
Imperium and the Confederation.
<P>
The world was the target of major Zhodani raids during
the later Frontier Wars, and of an attempted Sword
World invasion during the False War, but it has
remained in Darrian possession for its entire history.
<P>
But because of these factories, the Collapse and Virus
posed a special threat.  A controversy developed
between the company and local authorities, between the
Regency wanting to shut them down and the Darrians
wanting to keep them running, and within their own
governments between security services and industrial
planning agencies. In the end, the now renamed
Horizons was able to retain the factories, as the
authorities came to the conclusion that more would be
lost through shutting them down, and risking shortages
and price hikes in resources vital to the Quarantine,
than whatever viral threat they posed to the Spinward
Extents.
<P>
In order to keep the factories, the company agreed to
eliminate outside communication links, creating a
totally self-contained and airgapped communication and
control system placed in fortified military-style
command centers. Horizons beefed up security around
the facility, though more against outside intrusion by
agitators and anti-virus radicals, than against actual
Viral infection.  The company still has the confidence
of most of the local population, and it has eliminated
most of the old silicon-based systems that made the
world vulnerable, but there has been concerted action
by offworld protesters and action groups to disrupt or
impede local production. And while the company still
enjoys the confidence of the Darrian government, a
number of neighboring world governments and their
citizens have staged frequent protests and passed
disruptive resolutions against Horizons and the
Stern-Stern world government.
