	Sveinel has undergone changes since the collapse, including the die off of all of its human population, despite having maintained its D-class starport (a shadow of its former thriving B-class port. The Droyne of Sveinel have gone from being 40% of the planets sentient life to all of it. Part of the die off amongst humans on this gas giant moon-world, is due in fact to a biological agent into the world's thin tainted atmosphere. This agent has since died off, and with it, the collapse to TL-5 was cemented. The Droyne lost more than their human neighbors; they lost knowledge the humans knew and their expertise. Only those few Oytrips (Droyne associations) that had any technical expertise.
	The balkanization is a matter of form only. The Oytrips  cooperate as Droyne do, in matters of trade & expertise. They unite against a race-level threat vigorously, and only wage "ritual war" against one another when in dispute.

 As Uymayoress controls the D-class Downport, All off planet trade & exchange moves thru this influential "nation"/state. <a href="opal3054.html">Czerniak</A>  opened relations with them in 1188, prior to joining the Soleean Empire, which holds Aliens in dim regard. But the masked Consul of <a href="opal3054.html">Czerniak</A> conducts its own foreign relations here, if only to prevent the Guild from taking advantage of their absence., and holds an embassy here. Free Traders are still welcome, and they drift in here for minor repairs, and to pick up news from other Droyne worlds, save Yeroltoy/Syrs subsector, (which purposefully killed off its human population, and will attack any human borne ships that attempt to land.). The Droyne technicians here have an almost "magical" touch for repairs at the starport, thanks in part to genetics and Psionic teaching memories, something the Masked Consulate is studying by permission.
