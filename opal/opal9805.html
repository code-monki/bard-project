<P>
Paques is an unusual world: ninety percent of the
planet is airless plateaus and mesas. But ten percent
of the world lies in deep depressions created by
rifting. These rift valleys are between 5000 and 7000
meters deep, and they are the collection points for
subsurface gases and water that seep through the thin
crust. The local air is a cocktail of oxygen,
nitrogen, water vapor, sulfur dioxide and trace
amounts of hydrogen sulfide and igneous methane.
 <P>
Originally, this gas was mostly CO2 seeping up through
geothermal vents, but as life was seeded on the world
by cometary impacts, algae evolved within these vents
and began to produce oxygen through chemosynthesis.
Because most of this activity takes place far beneath
the surface, atmospheric pressure is only sufficient
to make the rift valleys tolerable to more advanced
life.
 <P>
Paques also posesses huge ice caps and glaciers at its
polar regions, constituting the majority of its
hydrosphere. The glaciers often flow into the rift
valleys, and where conditions are perfect, the melt
and fill large parts of the valley into deep rift
lakes similar to Earth's Lake Baikal and Tanganyika.
 <P>
The Strend Pact colonised the world in -235, and
built pressure domes  on the escarpments
surrounding these valleys to house the colonists.
Further exploration indicated that the world had only
limited mineral resources, and the colony subsisted
mostly upon meager trade with Strend and a few
agricultural goods seeded within the rift valleys.
When the Pact failed after a successful rebellion on
nearby <a href="opal9802.html">Sable des Etoiles</A>, the flow of necessary spare
parts for life support machinery was cut off. By 350,
the colonists had abandoned their failing settlements
for life on the valley floors.
 <P>
Life on Paques has a curious claustrophobic feeling to
it. The entire population lives by farming and animal
husbandry within the narrow clefts and gullies of
huge, yawning chasms kilometers deep.  Effectively cut
off from a horizon and the idea of a future it
implies, the locals seem cut off from notions of
progress or betterment. Life within these valleys is
fixed and unchanging, dictated by the seasons of their
world, the flow of potable water from the deep valley
vents, and the normal circadian needs of their own
bodies, and  crops and animals.  They are concentrated
on the lint in their navels as it were, trying to
piece together a life on a hostile world. Life is a
continous circle for these people. They scarcely even
look up at the sky, since that would create neck
strain.
 <P>
The entire population lives in large clans created out
of 4-6 extended families, who live in small
settlements of interconnected huts constructed out of
the local volcanic stone. These groups portion off a
large section of a rift valley for their own use
through the construction of large watchtowers and
obelisk-like boundary markers. Wars are infrequent,
occuring when the communities grow too close to each
other's grazing land and living space. Those
communities fortunate enough to exist next to a rift
lake usually construct their settlements either on the
lake or in fortified coves on the shore. Fishing
replaces traditional farming, and trade exists between
the different groups based upon the exchange of these
different commodities.
 <P>
Paques has been a seldom visited backwater for most of
the Imperial era. Producing barely enough food to
support themselves at subsistence level, and producing
few things of value beyond their unusual agriculture,
offworld trade was of marginal importance. But Paques
did attract the construction of a D-class facility, as
its  strategic location between Strend and <a href="opal9803.html">Dustpan</A>
required at least a marginal repair and service
facility for trade vessels.  Even with this offworld
presence, the locals still kept largely to themselves,
though trade delegations occasionally peddled food and
jewelry to transient ship crews.
 <P>
In 1152, a seeker belonging to Horizons (formerly
Sternmetal Horizons) mining division chanced upon a
huge deposit of Lanthanum in one of the large rift
valleys.  With Lanthanum made prohibitively expensive
thanks to the Spinward starship shortage and strict
government control over existing supplies, the
economic benefits immediately attracted massive
offworld interest.  Rival corps and prospectors
swarmed the world. setting up opposing claims all over
the ore body, and squabbling over the legality of
those claims. The locals were offended by the
intrusion, and revolted by the behavior of the
prospectors. By 1155, the government rating accurately
reflected growing anarchy, and growing confrontations
between various factions of offworlders, and with the
locals.
 <P>
RISS intervened in 1157, revoking the mining claims of
the fueding parties, and evicting the miners from the
valleys. After studying the situation for about five
years, the Regency awarded Horizons exclusive rights
to mine the Lanthanum. But there was one condition:
Horizons would have to defer to the locals and their
customs, and they would have to set aside investment
for local infrastructure and development. The company
reluctantly acceded to this demand, even going so far
as to hire the locals as miners. This development has
created mixed results, as the traditional culture has
been confronted with a modernism even more insidious
and opposed to its continuance than the prospectors
ever were.
