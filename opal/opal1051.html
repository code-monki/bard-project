According to military force generation rules in <cite>Path of Tears</cite> the Auroran military has the following assets:<BR>
18,000 total military personnel<BR>
1100 Navy Personnel<BR>
1500  Space Force Personnel<BR>
5500 Air Force Personnel<BR>
10,000 Ground Force Personnel<P>



resulting in:<BR>

4 Small Wet Naval Patrol Crafts<BR>
20 Aerospace interceptors<BR>
7 Defense batteries<BR>
3 Spacecraft under 1000 tons<BR>
5 Battalion Equivalents<p>

The Auroran military is divided into Aerospace Defense Force and the Defense Force.  The Aerospace DF controls the space combatants, the 20 Aerospace interceptors and the defense batteries.  The Defense Force fields the ground troops and the sea going ships.  
<P>
The Aerospace Defense Force fields three space capable combatants.  
These are the:<BR>

<I>Tiamat</I>  a TL-15 Patrol Cruiser (TNE Rulebook)<BR>
<I>Sleipner</I>    <a href="../sara/sara5026.html">Mosquito Destroyer Escort</A><BR>
<I>Fenris</I>      <A href="../sara/sara5029.html">Shambaltor Destroyer Escort</A><P>

All three ships were captured by the Solomani during the war and sent back for refurbishment.  As such they were not active when Virus struck.  After the immediate effects of the Collapse, the government reactivated the ships.  All three jump drives have been removed and the space has been used to added extra fuel and supplies.  Many of the TL-15 parts have worn out and replaced with TL-10 and TL-11 parts.  The weapon systems are still TL-15 though.  The designation for Auroran vessels, both sea and space is Auroran Naval Vessel or ANV, as in the ANV <I>Tiamat</I>.
<P>
The surface naval ships consist of four <I>Triton</I> TL-10 hydrofoils.  The <I>Triton</I>'s main armament are TL-11 anti-ship missiles.  They also carries a small autocannon for use against smaller opponents.
