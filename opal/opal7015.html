        Formerly the subsector capital, Wulfe was under Imperial Military
rule following the First Rim War. As it was a major trade nexus, it was 
one of the first worlds in the subsector to be infected by virus. The 
precautions taken by the inhabitants only prolonged their doom, though 
the few weeks warning they had did allow for some refugees to escape to 
Leng, Graff, and (especially) Etienne. Now Wulfe is a boneyard world, 
its domed cities still filled with the dessicated corpses of the dead,
its surviving planetary data nets home to various warring strains of Virus.
