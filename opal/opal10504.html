<B>Pieplow  Subsector:</B>
<P>
The 1116 population of Pieplow subsector was 3.5
Billion, of which 300 Million were Droyne. The highest
tech level was E, at Pieplow (0312). The Zhodani
Exodus has not impacted the subsector to bad, as most
refugees simply continue onwards towards neighboring
subsectors. Nonetheless, the 1202 population is 10.8
Billion, and the highest tech level is still E, at
Pieplow.
<P>
Pieplow Subsector was a safe backwater for most of its
history. While not very well developed, its proximity
to the heavily populated Shivva Cluster created a
demand for raw materials and cultivated articles, and
the region has had steady though unremarkable growth
through the centuries since settlement.  Nearly all of
its industry was located on Pieplow itself, most of it
in support of Shivva and its hi-pop worlds. Pieplow
was the only industrial world in the subsector, and
most of its industries were focused on harvesting,
processing and refining of its massive mineral wealth
for export to coreward. A few secondary parts and
components manufacturies rounded out its industrial
base.
<P>
The Exodus and the shock of civil war has disrupted
the normal loyalties that sustained the Zhodani
Consulate. Shivva and its associated planetary
governments are showing a lamentable oppurtunism, and
are making imperial demands upon the Pieplow subsector
and planetary governments. These range from demands
for preferential economic treatment, to demands for
loyalty to the emerging secessionary movement on
Shivva.  Thinly disquised greed motivates a good deal
of Shivva's actions, and it has outraged Pieplow and
its people. Fears that Shivva might invade, and
growing industrial shortages are driving efforts to
reorganise Pieplow's economy and defenses to local
self-sufficiency, an effort that is slowly bearing
fruit.
<P>
This independent course has dismayed the Iadr Nsobl
Council. The Council is keeping the province from
collapsing into chaos with white-knuckle intensity,
and it has been reluctant to encourage Pieplow's
policy. If it does, it fears that similar secessionary
movements might take this as encouragement for their
own independent action, and the province will catch
and spread the war fever of the coreward regions.  But
Pieplows' remoteness from the main Iadr Nsobl region
complicates concerted action, and problems with the 10
Fleet in neighboring Anika virtually guarantees the
Pieplow will have to act according to its own needs.
For the time being the Provincial Council has to be
satisfied with the loyalty oaths of the Subsector
Council and the 65th Fleet, and hope that things don't
turn out for the worse.
<P>
Pieplow Subsector is defended by the Zhodani 65th
Fleet from its base at Aflebshaql (0516). The 65th was
first formed in 1114, and only arrived here from
Zhdant Sector in 1155 in the wake of the Avalar
Controversy, and it has no history of military service
against the Third Imperium. The fleet is strongly
loyal to the Consulate government, and the recent
civil strife has severly affected its morale and
supply. While still able to maintain their ships and
material with supplies from Pieplow itself, it will be
insufficient should fighting envelop the spinward
extent of Foreven. The fleet commander has done an
admirable job of keeping her forces together in face
of adversity and the petty intrigue waged against them
by the neighboring 116th Fleet and its allies on
Shivva. The Fleet has been deployed in mostly
defensive positions, and a number of subsector and
world military units have been called up or
requisitioned as reinforcements.  Many fleet personnel
have relocated their families to Pieplow, or have
married into local society, a signal of the fleets
loyalty and commitment to defending the subsector by
all means possible.
<P>
Dumosif (0513) was interdicted not long after its
contact by the Zhodani in -705. The Droyne population
were extremely uninterested in outside contact, and
the Consulate was only too happy to oblige their
requests for privacy. Aside for the research station
staff at Epriatlech (0412) the world was off-limits to
non-Droyne. This policy changed after the Collapse, as
the Consulate needed the warships the enforced the
interdiction to be stationed on the trailing border
against Viral intrusion. From 1136 it became the
responsibility of the local Oytrip to enforce their
own interdiction, and some commercial contact had to
be tolerated. The Zhodani Civil War has complicated
matters considerably, as the Droyne were not that warm
towards the Consulate to begin with, and they are
showing signs of pursuing an independent course.
<P>
Aflebshaql (0516) was the pride of Pieplow, a rich
world well known for its beautiful landscape and
bountiful farms. The Pieplow Council opened up the
world to further development in the late 1130s with
the intent of deepening the subsectors industrial
base, and eventually creating a new hi-pop world. The
population swelled with new immigration, and even
before the Exodus had a population that was rapidly
approaching a billion. The Exodus brought a surge of
new immigration, and lately the government has begun
turning away incoming refugee ships because of the
increasing crowding in the camps that were established
for them. The 65th Fleet command has accused the
planetary government of willful "cherry-picking" of
incoming refugees, whereby the local Tavrchedl cadres
screen would be immigrants, and seperate out
individuals or groups that have desirable skills and
temperaments, before turning the rest of them out on
their merry way. The navy has retaliated by setting
aside large parts of the local naval reserves as
unconditional shelters that do not exclude anyone in
need.
<P>
The Exodus has turned Iantzpliq (0717) into and
unwilling high population world, and the original
rulers of the planet have been deposed by the local
military in an effort to stem the tide. Violent
confrontations have erupted between the security
services and refugees, as most of the latter have been
crowded into cramped, rudimentary facilities that
often lack clean water and adequate food and shelter.
Many refugees have eluded the coercive camp security,
and have fled into the outback of the world. In many
cases they resettle on vacant land, whether wilderness
or privately owned, and build primitive communities.
The military aggressively patrols against such
squatter communities, but it is waging a losing battle
in face of growing resistance and retaliatory attacks,
and a continuing tide of immigration.
