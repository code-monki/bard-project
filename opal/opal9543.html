Kegena was originally settled by various vagabonds and
outcasts, and the majority of its population were
nomadic hunter-gatherers, trappers and subsistence
herders. After the Fourth Frontier War, the world came
under the influence of Bevy, who wanted it as a safety
valve for its own restive population. This
colonisation has been viciously resisted by the
inhabitants, but the world's marginal state and poor
technology has left them no match for Bevy's advanced
weaponry. After the Collapse, thousands of Bevian
"filibusters" moved into the world, into the outback
beyond the starport, and crushed most resistance. The
locals are subject to frequent terror, and now live in
communities specially constructed for their
"inhabitance" or confinement, depending upon your
point of view. Resistance movements still exist in the
wilderness, but they are mostly impotent, and a
Representational Reform referendum in 1164 confirmed
Bevy's control of the world. A large contingent of
Regency Election Observers are maintained to deter
overt violations, and the Regency government has
registered its disapproval by refusing to remove the
world's amber status.
