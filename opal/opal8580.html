The local population is mostly employed in
terraforming operations. The local CO2 levels are too
high for the comfort of most sentients, and algae,
atmospheric scrubbers, and sequestration devices are
slowly reducing it to comfortable levels. The
colonists hope to open their world to greater
settlement and development by 1250, but have to create
some measure of dry land to accomodate a larger
downport. The colonists themselves live either at the
highport, or on floating platforms that tend to the
terraformation processes.
<P>
The Regency navy base is the headquarters for the 55th
Fleet, and is a massive, sprawling orbital facility in
its own right. Naval units use the world as a primary
refueling source, and large areas are reserved for
their exclusive use. Relations between the Navy and
the local civilian population have been strained over
usage of these areas. The Navy has even been sued in
Regency courts over its reneging on a deal negotiated
in Norris' time that agreed to open more than
two-thirds of the world to settlement in return for a
perpetual naval presence. This litigation is ongoing.
