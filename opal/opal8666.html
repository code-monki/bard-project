Formerly known as Brufort. The world was conquered in
1124 by a clan allied with the Seieakh bloc, and the
world was declared fait accompli in 1132.  Because its
new masters were abusive of the indigenous human
population, the Regency government granted land to
other friendly clans to counteract their influence.
Several clan wars have occured since the Collapse
between the original invaders and new arrivals, and
the world is heavily militarised as a result. The
integration of the Aslan has been complicated by the
harsh local climate, which has foiled the long-term
economic plans of several clans. Some clans have
become radicalised by their hardships, and the wars
have become more vicious in the last decade or so.
