One of the main principles of planetary geology is the
principle of isostasy.  Isostasy is a fancy word for
buoyancy, specifically properties of one material
floating within a medium of different consistency or
density.
<P>
The lithosphere, which is to say the rocky and solid
part of a planet, is almost never a homogenous
structure.  Because of differences in temperature,
pressure, mass and the continuing influence of bolide
(meteorite) collisions with a world, the lithosphere
is divided into several layers. For a "molten" core
world, the topmost layer is the crust, which consists
of either light continental crust and/or denser
oceanic crust. Beneath these rocks are the upper
mantle. Collectively these three regions are termed
the Asthenosphere.
<P>
On Earth the continents have a density of 2.8 g/cm3,
the oceanic rock is 3.1 g/cm3, and the upper mantle is
3.3 g/cm3.  Because of the minor differences between
their densities, the degree of displacement that must
exist within the mantle due to the overriding crustal
rock is quite significant.  There exists more
continental crustal rock under the base level (the
extant surface of the mantle) than exists above the
surface, whether it be flat plains or mountains.
Oceanic rock is mostly flat slabs a few kms thick, but
continental crust can be up to 50 kms in thickness in
mountain ranges, nearly all of it subterranean.
<P>
But normal isostasy assumes 1G acceleration on the
floating material. That means that buoyancy changes
proportionally with the amount of gravitational
acceleration.  That means that objects have greater
buoyancy on smaller worlds, but less on more massive
worlds.  This explains the strange paradox first
observed by the Solomani in regards to their home
system: smaller worlds and moons in the Terra system
have more massive geological features.  The greater
buoyancy allows more massive features to exist without
having to displace more medium (that is to say its
sinks) in compensation.
<P>
Denanus is a world a scant 3200 miles in diameter, and
possessing a gravitational force a mere one-third
normal.  But it has mountains that are twice as high
as Terra's Himilaya and Andean ranges.  In fact about
two thirds of the world has an elevation of greater
than 2000 meters.  Much of this is high intermontane
plateaus and rift valleys, most of its unsuitable for
agriculture or major habitation. Most of the
population is divided along the worlds coastlines
where elevations allow for flat ground, and where air
pressure allows for normal respiration. The world is
violently active, and active volcanos and earthquakes
are common. Tectonic velocities are about twice Terran
values, which on a small world creates massive changes
within small time frames!
<P>
The world is still young, and O2 pressure is rather
low as the local photosynthesizers have not produced
enough for unassisted respiration.  Most of the
population is committed to primary industries like
mining and basic aquaculture.  The mounatins are still
bare, and mulicellular plant life has not yet gained
much of a foothold on the coastlines either. Some
agriculture has been accomplished where soils have
begun to form, particularly within river deltas. Most
local mining consists of large placer operations, as
erosion from the local mountains chokes the rivers
with mineral rich sediment that is extracted and
sifted out.
<P>
The world government consists of the individual
settlement administrations operating in an overlapping
fashion. Many of these are private companies that have
divided the arable land into private fiefdoms, and
have just enough goodwill between them to create a
single set of ruling protocols for the populace. The
consortium of companies has become more and more
Regency dominated, either directly by Reg corps or by
immigrant enterprises. The Avalar naval base is
primarily a training facility for wilderness
operations, and is of little importance politically.
<P>
Denanus and its mountains have attracted a steady
stream of daredevils and expert climbers in the last
forty years or so.  The extreme heights and the severe
lack of oxygen in the thin atmosphere make these
mountains among the most dangerous in Charted Space,
and climbing can only be accomplished with air tanks
or environmental suits of some sort.  Coupled with the
very cold temperatures at higher elevations, and the
world has a steady stream of casualties during the
main climbing seasons.
