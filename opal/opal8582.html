Pangumo was a good example of what Vargr derisively
refer to as "Monkey Flight", the massive emigration of
the original human population caused by the arrival or
immigration of a sizeable Vargr population. Pangumo is
classified as "poor", and it was one of the few worlds
in Sabine subsector to accept refugees from the
Extents in any sizeable quantities. Despite the
enlightened efforts of the government, local disgust
at Vargr and their alleged violent tendencies,
reinforced by the presence of the Pack, has caused a
steady outflow of the local population since the
Collapse. The government has taken this in stride, and
the world is now dominated by Vargr officials and
leaders. Pangumo is mostly a mining world that was
settled to take advantage of the huge nickel-iron
deposits buried beneath the world's surface. The
system itself consists of just the mainworld and a
single gas giant, with no other celestial bodies
present.
