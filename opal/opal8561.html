The exact date of Tubb's settlement is unclear, but
historical data and archaelogical data put it sometime
before the founding of the Third Imperium. The
Solomani descended population of the world is
independent minded to the point of pain. Despite its
precarious position on the border with the Vargr, Tubb
had never fallen under the control or influence of any
major faction or power within Tuglikki sector. It is
unclear how the local government actually managed this
feat, but rumors exist of extensive stockpiles of
biological warfare weapons being developed by the
planetary government. The world had long rebuffed the
emissaries of the Third Imperium, and restricted
commercial contact to its downport.
<P>
Most of the population lived in semi- submerged
arcologies built in the shallows around the main
archipelagoes. Despite its low O<sub>2</SUB> levels, the world is
sufficiently rich to support human habitation. The
government is a socialist system known locally as the
"Leviathan", which formerly controlled nearly every
aspect of daily life. Word of the Collapse caused the
government to take advanced computer systems offline,
and replace them with TL-7 systems of local
manufacture, systems too dumb for effective Viral
infection. Despite the world's apparent isolation,
rumors persist that things are not what they seem, and
that the government is involved in some strange and
even disturbing activities.
