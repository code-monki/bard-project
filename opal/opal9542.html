Gitosy is one of the most unusual belts ever
discovered. The belt is in large encompassing sphere,
rather like an Oort Cloud, than in the expected
horizontal plane. Astronomers are at a loss to explain
this phenomenon, though the lack of other major
celestial bodies and their gravitational influence is
the main hypothesis. This odd arrangement has
encouraged the industrialisation of the system, and
each habitat exports large amounts of TL 9-12
machinery and goods to the outside Regency.  Little
unifies each habitat and their populations, and the
system is policed by a "let bygones be" attitude.
Corporate intrusion by Imperial Era megacorps was
violently resisted, and outside companies must compete
for local mining and manufacturing concessions.
