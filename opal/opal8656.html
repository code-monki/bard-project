The capitol of RQD 4 and home to the 183rd Fleet has
always been an ugly world viewed from orbit. The
world's atmosphere is at the lowest end of the "thin"
classification, and its appearance is marred by black
oceans against a contrasting sandy tan or grey
background. Despite this, the world's strategic
location in the Denebian Knot made it an important
trade and administrative center in the antebellum
period. Most of its economy was dominated by the
subsector government and local naval administration,
which have become more dominant since the evacuation
of other private industries after the Collapse.
<P>
Usani has always had an unusally large number of To
Will One Thing adherents in its population, and most
of these remained on the world in spite of the
Abandonement. As a result they've become the majority
on the world, and control what private economic assets
still remain on the world. Non-Willies have resented
this dominance, and tensions exist between the two
communities. With the opening of the Frontier more
Deneb corps and investment groups have begun opening
up offices and buying unused land on the world, and
the reactions of the Non-Willies is being carefully
scrutinised by local authorities.
