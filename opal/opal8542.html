Nibel is one of three wildside terminuses established
by the Regent and the Senate. All ships and cargos
originating in the Wilds must stop at one of these
three worlds for inspection, before proceeding into
the Regency Frontier and then the Safe for processing
or resale. Nibel itself is only lightly populated, and
the population has strong ties with local RQS patrols.
Most live nomadically in the outback, but have begun
to reappear at the old starport site, hiring
themselves as labor for the rebuilding project.
Because of its sensitive nature, the world is heavily
defended, and a battalion of Regency Marines are on
site to protect the construction crews.
