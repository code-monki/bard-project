<a href="opal9343.html">Titan</A> was engaged in a major economic struggle with
the Venues and governments of the Torinsk cluster
during the 900s. This conflict centered over market
control of Titan subsector, and actually saw minor
hostilities at several points. In an effort to stave
off futher penetration by the Torinsk Venues, Titan
settled four surrounding systems: <a href="opal9338.html">Spokes</A>, <a href="opal9344.html">Evaberi</A>,
<a href="opal9346.html">Ninox</A> (which quickly recieved its independence) and
Pudimon.
<P>
Pudimon is a cold barren rock of mixed ice and silica.
It is the outermost of twelve moons that orbit
Postrewa, the outermost gas giant. A trace atmosphere
of cold water vapor and thawed nitrogen is its only
feeble attempt at habitability, and it lacks any
resources other than water and few mineral deposits of
meteoric activity. A fair amount of trade passes
through the system between Titan and the nearby
Torinsk cluster, and this supported a sizeable
starport located at the gas giants trailing Trojan.
But otherwise the system was uninhabited, until Titan
took interest in the untapped wealth of its large
asteroid belt.
<P>
Pudimon's location swings it very close to the systems
rich asteroid belt, which is what made it attractive
for settlement. Titan's belters would find a rich
rock, start breaking up with mining lasers, and store
the ore until their orbital position brought them
towards Pudimon. They would then shoot the larger
chunks from a mass driver back toward Postrewa at an
angle and velocity that would bring the ore into a
"soft catch" within Pudimons orbit.  Cheap TL-8 and 9
ships would then retrieve the ore and ferry it to
Pudimon for processing and shipment to Titan.
<P>
Unlike Evaberi with its giant underground compost
heaps, or Spokes and its homegrown artisan industry,
Titan was not interested in Pudimon beyond mineral
extraction. It frequently slashed local life support
margins to the bone in an attempt to bleed as much
profit as possible from its operations. Consequently
living conditions on the world were horribly squalid
and overcrowded.  Revolts were common, and the even
the governors and clerks sent from Titan to run
administer Pudimon would shift their sympathies to the
overworked and crowded locals over time.
<P>
Eventually Pudimon was organised along military lines
in an attempt to maintain order, and strong discipline
and severely controlled local schedules were enforced
by military police sent from the Titan planetary army
or hired from <a href="opal9342.html">Highbury</A>. Individual miners were
assigned to work battalions for life, and it was
through the "officer" structure that amenities were
distributed fairly for hard work, which defused a
great deal of dissent. Many of these labor units
actually became affilated auxillary units with
Highbury Corps or Titan military units, and police
action duty on Titan became popular with "Puds" as a
means of escape from their oppressive lives.
<P>
The collapse of Titan's government following the
massive insurrection of the 1140s did not create a
similar social breakdown on Pudimon.  Rather there was
an immediate sense of euphoria mixed with uncertainty.
De facto independence was coupled with economic
dependence upon the mother world, and the threat of
economic depression muted any celebration. The whole
point of Pudimon's settlement was to prevent Titan
from becoming reliant upon its Torinsk rivals for raw
materials, and no other market existed for the world's
mineral resources that paid as well.
<P>
A number of Pudimon batallions were stranded upon
Titan following the outbreak of the Civil War, and
attempts to extract these offered an oppurtunity that
ultimately saved the world. Because of their neutral
status, physical conditioning and disciplined esprit
de corps, Pudimons units became a desirable commodity
in Titan's military market. Pudimon units often
replaced Highbury's departing units, which were barred
by its contracts with the Consulate from independent
actions, and quickly carved out their own reputation
for toughness and gallantry.
<P>
Under the cover of these operations, extraction and
recovery teams "shoplifted" abandoned or lightly
defended goods like spare parts, life support plants
and even whole industrial complexes for transit back
to Pudimon.  What the world didn't use for itself it
sold on the open market for a profit. This way it was
able to improve local living conditions, and develop
its own industry.  As the wars have quieted down on
Titan, this activity has been terminated, and their
units have been quietly removed for disbandment or
operations elsewhere.
<P>
Currently the world is on a fast pace to TL 10, and
hopes to make the world a fully independent system by
1205. The world's economy has shifted from mostly
mineral extraction to light industry, and it has taken
on a great deal of subcomponent contracts from the the
Torinsk cluster. It has also made a number of trade
contacts with more stable city-states on Titan, and
has even become a major player in rehabilitation and
reconstruction work on its former parent.
