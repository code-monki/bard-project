Dave Nilsen revealed on the TNE mailing list that:

There is a planet in Diaspora that has an automated, Virus-controlled 
shipyard, which manufactures brand-new starships with Virus deeply 
embedded in them. This was were the <I>Lily</I> was created in the
adventure <cite>The Guilded Lily</cite> by GDW.<P>

The one world that it has the Jump 3 link to is actually the "front desk" or 
factory showroom, populated by people concealing the Virus-controlled 
industrial world behind this. (Actually two worlds have J-3 connections
to Iselu, Fuji/Blight and Ebekhar/Iusea.)<P>

Deep space refueling is not necessary. They have some big Jump 3 ships that 
carry the smaller ships as cargo from the factory to the showroom, just like 
the big car carriers that come over from Japan.<P>
