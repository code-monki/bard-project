Kestral was contacted by Montero in 1158.  It
was the first target world of a Crusade by <a href="opal3020.html">Montero</A>.
At the time Kestral UPP was E7586A-5.
It was ruled by Prince Eneli who was backed by the Knights of the Thorn.
The Knights were a group of several dozen individuals equipped with
Imperial era battle dress and TL-15 FGMPs.  Together they were able
to keep the populace in line.  After several months of negotiation,
Prince Eneli agreed to convert to the <A href="../dani/dani7006.html">Word of God</A> and make it the
official state religion.  In exchange Montero would supply
technical aid to him. Montero quickly sent over thousands of
priests who went about converting the populace.  Prince Eneli
also made sure that any heretics were uncovered and put to death.
The Knights of the Thorn were the chief instrument of the inquisistion.
<P>
In 1174 Prince Eneli died and passed the thrown to his daughter Princess
Mileen, who was also the Canon of Kestral.  She united the office of
Prince and Canon and decreed that the titles would be passed down to
the first born of the family.  The Kestral UPP was now up to its current.
It was not able to produce full battle riders due to its low technoglical
level, but it was able to provide maintenance and support to the ships
built on Montero.
<P>
In 181 researchers under a grant from Princess Mileen uncovered evidence
that the universe had been created in seven days, rather than the six
days which was preached by the original prophets of the Word of God.
Princess Mileen studied the texts herself and after several days of
study and prayer, agreed with her researchers.  She sent several of
the researchers to Montero to present their work to the Archcanon.
She also instituted the new teaching  on Kestral.
<P>
The researchers proudly presented their work to the Archcanon on Montero.
The Archcanon was furious at their work and declared the researchers
heretics for their affrontery in claiming the orignal prophets could be
wrong.  The researchers were immediately executed.  The Archcanon sent a
battle fleet of two battle riders to Kestral to determine how much support
these heretics had, and to wipe out any other traces of heresy.  The battle
fleet demanded that the Princess renounce this heresy and atone for her
sins.  The Princess firmly believed in the new discoveries and refused.
The canon in charge of the battle fleet, retaliated by excommunicating
the Princess and her followers.  The Princess then realized that the
Archcanon and the people of Montero had fallen victim to a deep seeded
heresy and she declared herself the true Archcanon of Quinoid and declared
for a crusade against the heretics.
<P>
The Monteran battle fleet tried to land troops on Kestral's capital,
but they were repulsed by battle riders under the control of Kestral.
The battle fleet then retreated to Montero.
<P>
Today the situation is a stalemate.  Montero has constructed hundreds
of battleriders and can deliver them to the Kestral system in several
waves.  Kestral has only a few dozen battle riders that were built on
Montero and can not construct more.  It has built tens of thousands of
planetary defense missiles.  Montero's troops are better equipped, but
Kestral has numerical supremacy.  This military buildup has not helped
either economy.
<P>
The theological difference that ignited this conflict may seem trivial
and even silly to outside observers, but it is of th utmost importance
to believers.  The Word of God places a great deal of importance on
theological correctness and heretics are regarded as the most serious
threat.  True believers are granted paradise, while heretics are
condemned to eternal punishment.  If the heretical side was to win this
conflict, it would spread its heresy.  The converted followers of this
heresy would be condemned to eternal punishment, without even being able
to hear the truth.  Each side sees itself as on a crusade to save the
souls of the rest of the galaxy.  Neither side will compromise and will
only cease hostility when the other side has recanted.
<P>
Of course this was not the only cause of the conflict, Princess Mileen
and the Knights of the Thorn were feeling increasingly threatened by
decrees from the Archcanon, and felt that their power was being erroded.
The Archcanon realized that Kestral would soon overtake Montero in terms
of economic output and would come to dominate the Word of God and the
subsector.
<P>
Kestral has no jump capable ships.  It has several dozen 500ton battle
riders. While it has a good starport, most Free Traders have been scared
away from coming here because of threats from Montero.  Montero also
occasionally drops battle riders in the system, which will attack any
ships they find.  This has isolated Kestral from the benefits of
interstellar trade.  Montero sees it as halting the spread of the
Kestral heresy.
 <P>
The Knights of the Thorn are a knightly order open to all citzens of Kestral.
There are 99 Knights at any time.  When a Knight goes to paradise, the next
canidate is knighted.  The canidates are choosen purely based on their
physical and religious qualifications.  There is very little if any
nepotism.  The Knights are sworn to uphold the crown and the Word of God.
They have a strong sense of honor and will never break a vow.  If a
Knight is torn between two conflicting vows, he will choose to commit
suicide.  `Death before dishonor' is a very real concept to the Knights.
While their are only 99 knights, and hence only 99 suits of battle dress,
there are quite alot spare parts.  A shipment of supplies for an Imperial
marine division was stranded on Kestral and the spare parts enable the
Knights to keep their suits going.  It also has plenty of ammunition
for their fusion guns.  Canidates knights form an elite unit which backs
up the Knights on their missions.  This gives the Knights the chance to
see the canidates in action before they are picked for knighthood.
