Albe orbits its primary: Algernon. A hot, bone dry
world, it was chiefly colonised to exploit metal
deposits on its sister worlds Hardy and Thackeray.
The world surface has no sources of water, but the
mantle and lower crust are heavily saturated with
"meteroic" water deposited by ancient vulcanism.
Because of the low O<sub>2</sub> content, most of the population
lives in large subterranean cities known as Kivas,
these structures are built with the same care and
skill reserved for space habitats, and are fully
sealed and self-contained.  Albeans are notorious for
their conservation habits, and a waste-not, want-not
philosophy permeates their culture and institutions.
<P>
Albe was conquered by a large Ihatei force, after a
bitter fight, in early 1119. In many cases the
population retreated into their kivas and maintained
passive resistance against their conquerors.
Resistance was so bad that the clans were induced into
ruling the world from orbit, which is to say not at
all. De facto independence from any power led to a
power struggle between several resistance groups and
the central government, which degenerated into a full
civil war fed in large part by clashing personalities
and a decline in civic unity encouraged in large part
by the growing influence of guerilla groups.  Even
after the world's Liberation by the Regency in 1132,
it wasn't until 1144 that these wars finally ground to
a halt.
<P>
The local space defenses are among the most powerful
in the Regency. Several planetoids are located in
orbit, having been hollowed out for meson guns, missle
bays and launch facilities. These <I>Cerberus</I> stations
are fully mobile 500,000 ton moniters, and a total of
five are on permanent station. Ten smaller 75,000 ton
<I>Garm</I> stations supplement their bigger brothers from
their assigned positions orbiting Albe's satellite,
Manley.
<P>
Behind this shield a large new highport, the Miniver
station, has been constructed for trade between the
Hierate and the Regency. Miniver has a population of
over five hundred million, much of it transient, and
it is the largest conveyor of goods between the two
states along their entire border with each other. Most
of the station is little more than a giant warehouse
and ship servicing facility.  Most actual business
occurs in the capitol city of Koresh, in a massive
market facility known as the Albe Exchange. This is
one of the few good legacies of the whole Midashi
business, a purpose built trading and diplomatic
center to facilitate contact and good relations
between the Regency and the Hierate. The Exchange is a
virtual embassy for every major clan in the Hierate,
and there is subsidised housing and facilities for
Aslan trade and diplomatic delegations. Located not to
far away from the Exchange are the headquarters of
Prismodyn and the famous/infamous Midas Research Lab,
where Midashi entertained Albe for about ten years
with his wondrous "discoveries", and engineered the
collapse of the local economy in 1147.
