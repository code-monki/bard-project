   <P>


All habitable worlds go through cycles of slow decay.
Most worlds are created with a bounty of gas and
liquids on their surfaces, the result of their fiery
births.  But as they cool, their bounty is lost
through steady subtraction. The oceans are lost
through plate subduction, as hydrated minerals are
plunged into the mantle, depleting the hydrosphere at
a rate faster than volcanism or meteoric processes can
replenish it. The atmosphere is slowly stripped away
by the solar wind and gravitational escape.
 <P>
Dustpan is appropriately named. An old (est. 5.1
billion years old) world where this process of
planetary aging has turned it into a dry wasteland.
The world is divided into uplands that mark the former
continents, and huge sediment filled basins that are
the former oceans.  The planets extensive fauna and
flora have mostly died out, leaving only small, hardy
desert stock in its place. Surface water is rare, and
the atmosphere is almost unbearably dry.
 <P>
Dustpan was first settled by Solomani colonists around
-60, who came to exploit the huge mineral beds that
now lay uncovered in the basins of its former oceans.
Huge strip mining operations scarred the surface, as
overlaying sand and sediment were scraped away to get
at precious deposits of manganese, nickel and iron.
 <P>
The relative lack of potable water made that resource
even more valuable, as the original mining camps
became the cores of permanent human settlements.  Most
water on the planet is "meteoric" in nature, meaning
aquifers of very old water trapped underground with no
means of outflow. However those same aquifers have no
source of replenishment, and the water flow diminished
in proportion to the increase in population.  By 400,
most communities on the planet were increasingly
polarised on the water issue, and guerilla wars broke
out over the best remaining water sources.
 <P>
Politically the world is divided at the communal
level. Isolated city states, known as Kirs, are found
at well heads, most of which are found on the northern
"continent" of Ghibli. Kirs are of 10,000-30,000
people, and are mostly self-sufficient in the
production of foodstuffs, and most basic TL 7-8 goods.
Almost all are old domed cities that have expanded
into huge citadels that sprawl over advantageous
terrain. Government is by represenative councils,
where a block or ward within a Kir elects a senior
member to the main Community Council, usually for
three to five year terms. The legal codes for the
world are severe, and regulate every part of daily
lives. Water wastage is a capitol offense, in case
your wondering.
 <P>
The locals subsist on dryfarming of a local tree
called the Sherrycoat, whose leaves, roots and bark
are very rich in nutrients. Two other plants, the
Hoehoie, an edible grass, and the Mersandt, which is
prized for its succulence and medicinal properties,
supplement it.  Most meat is obtained from the raising
of Chupika, a dog-sized animal resembling both a
kangaroo rat and hamster.
 <P>
Power for electricity and water pumping is provided by
wind turbines, for despite the atmospheres thiness the
world's severe temperature diffrentiations create
constant windflows. Duststorms are frequent, often
isolating Kir-dwellers inside. The local dust is heavy
in alkali salts and other ancient evaporates, making
its somewhat toxic. Even more dangerous is the massive
internal heat and electrical disturbances created by
these huge storm columns. These huge storms combined
with nearly unbearable outside temperatures, confine
most of the world's population into their insulated
and fortified dwellings, effectively isolating them
from each other, and the much larger universe.
 <P>
No permanent political grouping above the local Kirs
exist. The worlds highport and two downports are
administered by an outside company to maintain their
neutrality.  If concerns of mutual interest, or a
global crisis, exists an informal council known as the
Xhoma is convened at a location determined by lottery,
and each Kir is represented by its most senior
Councillors. But petty wars are as common as attempts
at mediation, and the locals have given up trying to
impose their unified will upon a world as hostile as
theirs.
 <P>
Outside of the Kirs exist the Dust Gypsies,
peripatetic traders that travel across the world
desert between Kirs in huge caravans of trucks or huge
locally manufactured "landships." These groups are
exempted from local politics, even conveying trade
between warring Kirs. These groups are utterly at the
mercy of their markets for shelter and water, and it
is considered anathema to attack them. The Dust
Gypsies are especially important for one reason: they
collate and collect data on marriageable men and
women, acting as matchmakers between eligible grooms
and brides seperated by the planets vast distances.
This marriage commerce is more than for
self-edification: it allows the otherwise isolated
Kirs the means of replenishing their otherwise limited
gene-pools.
 <P>
For that same very reason, offworlders are heavily
recruited as either prospective mates, or as surrogate
parents and donors, to provide children with offworld
genes. The world's hospitality to offworlders is
famous, or infamous, in the Approaches, and many of
Menorial's merchant crews maintain close ties with the
world, taking "contract mates" they visit several
times a year.
