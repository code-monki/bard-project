Djar was a major victim of the Representational
Reform's "Escape Clause." The original colony nearly
died out, and Djar's local oligarchy arose from the
engineering elite that managed to salvage the
situation. Many of these oligarchs were offworld
professionals imported by the original government, and
their lack of local ties led to oppressive rule when
they attained power. Djar was too fragile for an armed
rebellion, and nearly half of the population left for
greener pastures rather than fight the entrenched
power structure. The government has belatedly started
a massive modernisation program in an effort to stem
further emigration, but this will likely lead to the
oligarchs overthrow instead.
