Neubayern is one of the three worlds originally
settled by the long range ESA colony mission. Most of
the population lived in compact, comfortable cities on
the world's two smaller, northern continents,
reserving the warmer southern continents for
agricultural production. A socialist bureaucratic
system was developed to fairly distribute housing and
food to the growing population, and to provide
regimented education assisted by rigorous testing to
provide employment to all of the worlds citizens based
upon their abilities. Eventually a hereditary elite
arose from this meritocracy, and the population and
most of the world's industry were parceled into
estates under the control of each "Elector", and
subject to their whims.
<P>
The once heavily industrialised world suffered immense
losses during the Islands War, the result of fighting
too many enemies at once. Worn down by attrition on
several fronts, it forces could only manage feeble
resistance against the New Home planetary strike
squadrons that razed Schleisen Belt and several of
Neubayerns communities. The massive destruction
uprooted large sections of the population, driving
them across estate boundaries into neighboring
regions. Since that time the Electors have become
progressively less relevant, and a new generation of
popular leaders has challenged them from refugee and
internment camps. <P>
Recently the Electors has engaged in the four way
negotiations between themselves and Amondiage,
Sansterre and Serendip. All four of these worlds are
intent upon rebuilding their shattered economies with
the incentive of reconstruction money from the Regency
government. While much of Neubayerns' industry remains
shattered, much of its agricultural productivity has
survived and expanded. The other three worlds are
chronically short on foodstuffs, and the Electors hope
to create a complimentary market with the other
peaceseeking worlds to raise revenue and rebuild the
remainder of their world.
