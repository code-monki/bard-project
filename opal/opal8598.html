Lilad is the only free orbiting world in its crowded
system. It is a small, mountainous world covered in
deep oceans, with extensive pack ice and glaciers in
the polar regions. Many low rifts and canyons are
covered in bogs and swamps that choke the atmosphere
in phosphorescent methane gas clouds known as "Faerie
Fog" and create a foul odor of dirty socks that hangs
over the lower elevations. Surface land for habitation
and farming is in short supply, and most communities
are built on pier like cities or shallow water
arcologies in coastal zones.
<P>
The world did possess substantial mineral resources,
particularly nickel and platinum group metals that
attracted colonists in the latter part of the first
century. Though most of these are now played out after
a millenia of exploitation, it did attract and fund
the worlds enormous industrial base. In Antebellum
times it was considered to be the Queen of the Rift,
as its tech level exceeded that of every other world
on the Rift Highway with the exception of
Lintl/Vestus. Despite a poor starport and no local
shipbuilding assets, the world was a major industrial
player since the 300s.
<P>
The world's growing importance prompted the creation
of the Ducal seat of Lilad in 411. For most of its
history the world was nominally under the control of
the ruling Kawabe family. However the Kawabes were
often little more than figureheads, with most
political power being concentrated in the hands of a
handful of bureaucrats and industrialists that ran the
government subsidized industries and services. Because
of their economic dominance of the subsector, these
individuals and their allied government agencies
became infamous for their intrusion and interference
in neighboring worlds. The Lilad government tried to
dictate the economic destinies of its neighbors and
immediate competitors for centuries. It generously
funded megacorp access to its cheap labor and abundant
resources, making itself the perfect world to be
exploited, in return the local oligarchs recieved the
funding it needed to hinder the development of its
neighbors and rivals. The founding of GeDCo by
Solomani nobles following the Alkhalikoi ascension
undermined its control over Zeng, but it remained
dominant by its support and alliance with other
tyrannical regimes, most notably Giranima and
Gorod/Macon (Reft 1302).
<P>
In order to remain competitive, local labor and
political groups had to be utterly meek and
inoffensive to their overlords, to better attract the
offworld and megacorp interest that bankrolled the
oligarchs opulent lifestyles. Much like Endup/Gulf,
the local rulers were winked at by Imperial
policymakers, who proclaimed Lilad a model world. In
reality oppressive laws against political freedom,
invasive police and surveillance, preferential
treatment of monopoly businesses, vast corruption and
the trickle down of few economic benefits created a
life of misery for the masses. The regime based its
power on a hardened core of government and monopoly
employees that were guaranteed lifetime jobs in return
for their absolute loyalty, and who were eager in
their persecution of disloyal elements. Several
rebellions broke out in the antebellum period, but
were all supressed with heavy loss of life.
<P>
But Lilad and her economic dominance came under attack
during the Civil War, as megacorps pulled out of the
Domain of Deneb, and during the Collapse, when the
money her oligarchs relied upon dried up with the
death of the Imperial administration. Economic
restructuring just in the nick of time prevented an
economic meltdown and subsequent revolution, and the
government was able to secure Regency money through
the Industrial Development Program by showcasing its
supposed economic might. An A-class starport and
supporting shipyards were built to help alleviate the
starship shortage, and there was even idle talk of
transferring the subsector seat to the world.
<P>
But as the Dreamtime wore on, Lilad's economic and
poltical weaknesses became evident, a giant Imperial
era Potemkin village. In the increasingly competitive
markets of the growing Stronghold, Lilad proved to be
bloated, inefficient and weak in economic
fundamentals. Manufacturers found its labor force
unmotivated, its factories uncompetitive, and its
goods and services unnecessarily expensive. Sabotage
and boycotts drove many investors away, as did the
corrupt and bureaucracy bound government. Many
oligarchs had veto power over new investment, ever
keen to protect their interests against offworld
competition.
<P>
Following the Liberation Riots, disgruntled military
units in outlying districts mutinied against the
planetary government, and seized control of their
postings. Rebel armies clashed with the bodyguard
units and private militias of the oligarchs for nearly
five years before the Regency government was able to
broker a peace deal, but by that time the world had
fractured into four different parts:
<P>
<LI><B>Collegium Obsequium:</B> This state includes most of
the surviving Oligarchs and remaining members of the
Kawabe family. It still controls the main starports
and most of the larger arcologies. But infighting and
continuous infiltration of guerillas and saboteurs
causes daily flare ups of terrorism and ambushes.
Most of the Oligarchs are more intent upon personal
survival, and either are slipping offworld with
whatever wealth they can smuggle, or are preparing to
take full control over personal fiefs in the upcoming
meltdown.

<P>
<LI><B>Merlin Enterprise Federaton:</B> A free trade bloc
centered upon the grav city of Merlin. The Federation
controls not only the world's grav cities but all
orbital habitats, numbering some 8 billion people. The
MEF is the most advanced technologically, but most of
its inhabitants are descended from offworld immigrants
that came here to help build the worlds TL-15
infrastructure. Hit has little support among native
born Liladians, and it is considered to be irrelevant
in local politics. For the most part the MEF has
seceeded completely from the ground culture, and has
instituted strict controls over immigration and trade
with the surface. <p>

<P>
<LI><B>Lagaashkir League:</B> Military republic that controls
the world's smallest continent of Lagaashkir,
traditionally the poorest and most backward region.
The local military cadres took advantage of a popular
uprising to overthrow the local oligarchs and install
senior military officers in their place. SInce then
promised reforms have stalled, and it has become clear
that one set of overlords have merely been replaced
with another. Further rebellions have been stemmed by
an absolute banning of private arms stockpiles, and
the fact that the compactness of the region allows the
junta to maintain a close eye on all travel and trade
flows.<p>

<P>
<LI> <B>Aasikgir Federation:</B> The freest, and smallest of
the four factions. Aasikgir is the continent to the
west of the main continent of Giruuda, and possesses
the smallest population. This has also made it the
most defiant of the Oligarchs control, and the locals
have a semi-democracy that is still coming into its
own as a working pluralistic government. Impeding its
maturity is a dearth of offworld investment, and the
continuing standoff with the Collegium in the East.
The Federation is still rather suspicious of
offworlders, and has had rocky relations with the
Regency government.<p>

<P>
An Amber Zone was imposed in 1167, following near
nuclear war between the different factions. A full
corps of the Regency Army, the XXIV Corps, is
stationed on the world to prevent a full blown set of
hostilities. However, rather than resolving the
problem, it has emboldened the less stable and more
aggressive parties and factions to redouble their
efforts, intensifying tensions and an increasing sense
of internal collapse.
