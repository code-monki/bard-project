-Avalar Consulate "jokes"
</UL><P>
It only seems natural that a world named after the
soccer stadium of one of ancient Terra's most colorful
sporting teams would have a culture to match. Highbury
is a member of the "Football Cluster" (only a idiot
with a death-wish refers to it as the Soccer Cluster
in earshot of a local) a four-world grouping
noteworthy of their peculiar culture, which is
directly descended from the ancient culture of Terra's
British Islands. <P>
How this group got here is one of the strangest
stories in the annals of starflight.  The "Footies"
arrived here around 750, in a fleet of derelict
sublight ships that were sent out from Terra around
the time of the formation of the Terran Confederation.
 The group that inhabited the ships are largely
thought to be voluntary exiles, possibly runaways or
dissidents that seized or blustered their way into
possession of these ships.  At any event they showed
more chutzpah than judgement,as few of them had the
requisite skills needed for survival in a colony. For
that matter, few of them showed any skills of any
kind.<P>

The Footies used to claim that they were part of a
larger fleet of vessels, whose populations were
segregated according to their skills.  The first wave
of ships carried people that were mostly skilled at
telephone sanitisation and other necessary jobs, and
they were to be followed by later waves of vessels
carrying the best and brightest. Sadly, a Footie will
tell you, no evidence of this follow on fleet was ever
sighted, meaning that some kind of catastrophe must
have overtaken them.  Incredibly enough, the Avalar
Consulate government actually believed this stupid
story for about ten years after contact.
<P>
With Avalar and Zhodani assistance, the Footies were
settled on a cluster of four unclaimed and lightly
populated worlds, which were quickly named after the
stadiums of popular British football (please refer to
the above admonition) teams.  Highbury is named after
the playing field of London's famous Arsenal team.
Interestinly enough the ships' population actually
seems to have dispersed according to their sports
loyalties, and settled accordingly. One colony,
Anfield, did not succeed, which is explained away by
their fellows as, "That's Liverpool for ya."
<P>
While Trafford and White Hart have managed to attain a
semblance of civility with Avalar and Zhodani
assistance, Highbury has remained true to whatever
street culture bred its ancestors emerged from. It is
joked that besides football, rioting is the national
sport.  Civil disturbances are a common occurence, and
a natural conclusion to many major events.  Rioting,
looting, street fighting and anarchy are rife.
Loyalties in street battles run from family, to
street, to neighborhood, to communities, and finally
to the geographic region and commercial loyalties.
<P>
But what is most suprising about this seeming disorder
is its ritualised nature, and its economic nature.
Highbury is a reasonably comfortable agricultural
world, but aside from foodstuffs the world has little
means by which to attract income, as it lacks viable
alternatives or heavy industry.  The world's tech
level is sufficient for automation of most
agriculture, which leaves few outlets for young
workers.  But early on, Highbury discovered that
Foreven had a critical need for mercenary soldiers
trained in urban warfare, police action and
peacekeeping.  Hence, the real purpose of these street
fights is to hone skills among the young and the
unemployed that are put to real use in the sizeable
contingents of merc troops that the planetary
government hires out, mostly to the Avalar Consulate.
<P>
The Arses like to explain that it only seemed natural
given the world's association with a team with a name
like Arsenal.  While the world does hire out some of
the toughest mercs in known space, troops who
unflinchingly carry out the toughest duties, the
people of this strange little planet are treated as
being the internal cogs of some strange mechanical
mystery, and visitors to neighboring worlds from
Highbury are often greeted with heavy police
surveillance.
<P>
Currently the Zhodani Exodus has given the locals the
reason to take a vacation from their current
government. Another caretaker government will probably
be announced in the near future, once the current
celebrations wind down (and the fires are put out).
