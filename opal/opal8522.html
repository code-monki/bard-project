Jode's atmosphere is an unbreathable soup of carbon
dioxide, methane and water vapor. The mixture is kept
fluid by friction generated by the world's rotation,
and high winds caused by thermal variances in the
upper levels. In the lower valleys and canyons, the
atmosphere often condenses into a chemical slush that
covers the ground in a manner reminiscent of thick
snow. Because of the ready availability of raw
materials, SuSAG constructed several extraction plants
here in the 980s for a variety of chemical and
medicinal purposes. The entire population lives in a
quartet of orbital habitats located in low orbit.
Crews are shuttled down to work four day shifts at the
various plants scattered around the surface. Concerns
over the vulnerability of this world to Viral
infection led to a partial evacuation during the
1130s, but the
remaining population has steadfastly refused to
relocate. SuSAG has pulled out most of its people, but
continues to subcontract its facilities to local
companies. The local tech level is too low to maintain
the orbital stations, and the local government has
consolidated into a bureaucracy to better pool
resources.
