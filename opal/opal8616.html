The surface of Thane is divided by a complex of
ranches and farms known as the Association. Local
feudal landholders (known as Thanes, naturally) have
held these for nearly four hundred years, living in
splendid libertarian isolation, with only their
conscience and codes of conduct as a guide. They have
have stubbornly resisted the massive immigration that
has occured since the Collapse. Most of the population
lives in a pair of cramped cities adjacent to the
downport, and their resentment of the local political
situation has been allayed by generous monetary and
physical assistance from the Thanes. The capitol city,
Husak, contains nearly seventy percent of the
population, and overlooks the massive Norma River
delta. Most of the population lives in floating
structures on the river or the sea, most of it
temporary housing built fifty to sixty years ago that
has become permanent.
