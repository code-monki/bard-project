The only fly in the ointment is Phoenix, formerly known as Vanguardia.
Pre-collapse it was, by Hinterworlds standards, a large colonial power.
It's colonies of Strnad, Prospect, Edward's Meet, and Leroy (In SubSecN)
were well managed, with liberal government. With the coming of the Virus,
Vanguardia fell into chaos, and it's recovery was stunted as the planet 
fractured along ethnic lines. In the recent past the Dictator of the 
Macunan Federation has all but triumphed against his opponents, and a
ceasefire is in place over most of the planet. In order to keep up the
dynamism of his rule the Dictator, Seen Lernon, has built up the space
forces under his control. He is seeking to conquer Mello, which was 
formerly a colony known as Prospect. The Nearby trading world of Selding
is trying to prevent this, principally through diplomacy. However, the 
Macunan's technical expertise is increasing, as they have access to the 
3000 year old Grand Library of thier defeated neighbor of Dunlin. Now 
Lernon is less reliant on the relics traded by the Selding traders, and 
hopes to have a good percentage of relic machinery in operation soon.
<P>
The Macunan Federation's Forces consist of the following:<p>

4 million personnel.<br>
<UL>
1.6 Million in the Federation Navy.<BR>
1.2 Million in the Air Armada.<BR>
17400 in the Space Exploration Force.<BR>
1.1 Million in the National Army.<BR>
82600 Security Police.<BR>
</UL>

The Equipment of the Forces is:<BR>
<UL>
Federation Navy: 400 Major Combatants, 1200 Minor Combatants,
20 Divisons Navy Militia.<BR>
Air Armada: 200 AD Batteries, 5800 Aircraft.<BR>
Space Exploration Force: 1 Light Cruiser, 3 Monitors, 11 SDBs,
3 Merc Cruisers (1 jump-capable), 5 Solomani Patrol Cruisers 
(1 jump-capable),  3 Scouts (all jump-capable), 2 Armed Fat
Traders (all jump-capable).<BR>

National Army: 55 Divisons.<BR>
Security Police: 41 Batalions.<BR>
</UL>
<P>
The Space Exploration Force is equipped to a much higher tech
level than one might assume. It's former space tech rating was
C, maintained in part by imported equipment. This was the minimum
deemed feasible for maintaining it's Colonies. <P>
