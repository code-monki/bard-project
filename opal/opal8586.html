Irumunu is dominated by middlemen engaged in the
plentiful trade between Vincennes and the remainder of
the Regency. The local government is rather laissez
faire as a result, despite tough local living
conditions. The system's highport is also the main
community, and contact with the world's surface is
limited to specially constructed robotic probes.
Access to the surface is not recommended. Despite a
lack of local laws, self-policing structures are
strictly observed, in light of overcrowding and a lack
of institutional support.  The population includes
many transient merchants and free agents trying to
gain access Vincennes' tightly restricted markets,
creating a large hiring hall of people who will do
just about anything.
<P>
The Way Station is a seperate habitat, and is the
oldest such facility in the Regency. The heavy
influence of the Scout Service is reflected in the
informal nature of the local government, which
consists more of an interactive computer network than
any actual institutions. The inefficiency of this
system requires that the Scouts act as the main focus
of public of public assembly, and a council of former
scouts spurs the population into action. Scout
security patrols frequently visit Irumunu High, and
are reinforced by large numbers of retired scout
personnel living and working in the port who keep an
eye on things.
