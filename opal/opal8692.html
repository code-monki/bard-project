Unxava's population is heavily concerned with
politics. The world was originally ruled by an
oppressive government that was overthrown only with
considerable hardship. Fearful of further
dictatorship, the locals decentralised their
government as much as they could. In the years before
the Civil War, the local communities had developed a
participatory democracy, but along more paternalistic
lines. A massive disparity in vote power along
geographic lines, and the general lack of "one man,
one vote" meant that some communities and their
citizens had more pluralistic power than others. When
the Representational Reforms came along, it saved the
world from a potential civil war, as the aggrieved
communities opted for a technocratic structure that
would guarantee the mastery of their own fates.
