Formerly known as Malkei. The world had been colonised
in waves from Vland Sector, and its diverse population
did not get along with each other. Most communities
were crowded together in a small number of island
chains, and connected by fleets of wandering fishermen
and traders. Land shortages and resource conflicts
boiled over into fueds between communities and
families. The Vargr invasions of the Civil War period
caused Lamas to relax its control over the world, and
fragmentation was unavoidable. The Assemblage of 1116
seized the highport in 1127, and the world became a
refuge for its surviving forces after the Battle of
Ashes. The highport is under the exclusive control of
the descendants of these raiders, and the Ngorsraek
faction uses it to influence the warring nations on
the world surface. By controlling trade and access to
the world, many surface nations have become Vargr
tributaries. Though this arrangement means having to
tolerate the nationalistic Ngorsraek and their
activities, the Regency prefers it to the simmering
communal tensions that threaten to immerse the world
in neverending civil war.
