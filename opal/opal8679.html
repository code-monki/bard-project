Starn was a fortuitous beneficiary of astrography. Its
location in the middle of the Sabinar Main, coupled
with its abundant resources, made it an economic
powerhouse from the very beginning of its habitation
in the early 200s. The belt is actually something of
an oddity: both of the systems' gas giants have highly
eccentric and elliptical orbits. Their gravitational
influence ejected whatever rocky worlds that formed in
the inner and habitable zone into deep space, leaving
little more than meteoritic flotsam and jetsam that
clumped into the three belts. The distribution of
material in the main belt is uneven, with larger rocks
clustered in a manner similiar to trojan points,
seperated by areas of pebbles and gravel.
<P>
Where the larger rocks cluster, the communities across
several rocks have united to form large metropolitan
areas. Because of their close proximity to each other,
community identity is not focused in a particular
rock, but rather across the adjoining gulf of space.
Planetoid cities then are not built in the center of
their rocks, but rather ring around them in exposed
arcologies. Personal transport is therefore very
cheap, and a large segment of the population has vacc
suit and zero-g skills. Travellers arriving in one of
the major cities will be confronted with planetoids
that look more like disembodied city blocks, covered
in titanic buildings and large holographic beacons and
signs. Small craft and Personal Maneuver Kits buzz
between these like swarms of angry wasps. The local
population is about average in their reactions to
offworlders, but their greater accesibility makes them
seem more approachable.
<P>
Starn is a very important industrial system. Mining is
mostly done in the two outer belts, leaving the main
planetoid belt settlements to concentrate upon
manufacturing. Its most prominent product is
starships, and shipyard facilities owned by LSP were
the largest in all of Deneb in Antebellum times. After
the Rape of Trin, the economic slump hurting trailing
Deneb was exaceberated by panic at the possibility of
further attacks on that scale, and worlds like Starn
and Ashasi were abandoned during the 1140s by billions
of citizens fleeing for worlds further to spinward.
During this period Starn lost a good portion of its
population and its skilled workforce, nearly crippling
its economy and ruining its chances to advance to
TL-16. This demographic outflow has been reversed, but
it has only been since 1190 that the world has
returned to its antebellum technological and economic
levels. <P>

Fortunately enough skilled talent and ready hands
remained on the world to maintain its TL-15 rating,
and it became a major arsenal for the Regency during
the Viral War years. The system is home to the Green
Million, a huge complex of orbiting factories, which
includes Plant 26, formerly known as LSP Alpha. The
"million" in its name is reflective of the huge
numbers of microplants that grew out of the myriad
garage shops that Starn was famous for. Starn's
population is very technically oriented, and most were
in engaged before the Civil War in hobbies oriented
towards amateur shipbuilding and electronics. During
the desperate years of the early Collapse these same
shops became the center for the manufacture for just
about any kind of specialised military product
imaginable.
<P>
Because of all this hands on access to technology,
Starn has had to develop one of the most extensive
engineering and scientific infrastructures ever seen
in history. The system is home to prestigious
engineering colleges like Mariner University and
Zanter-McCord Polytechnic, and Ivy Curtain schools
like Icaris University and St. Orange College. After
recieving a few years of formal training, technical
graduates spend several years apprenticing on the
assembly lines of local factories, or in local labs.
After years of struggle against history, Starn is once
again poised to storm the TL-16 battlement.
