Soonrod is the exclusive property of Pentagogue,
Avalar's second largest company.  Pentagogue was
formerly the Consulate's main military-industrial
combine, before it was semi-privatised in the
aftermath of the break with Zhodane. And its ownership
of Soonrod is vital to the company and its leadership
role in organic chemistry, genetic and military
textile industries.
<P>
The world itself is covered with dense forests
shrouded in a thick fog of heavy gases toxic to
humans. Despite the taint, a diverse ecosystem has
evolved on the world. Most of the fauna are little
more advanced than terrestrial insects.  It is one
class of these invertebrate animals, a group known as
"Bell-Spiders" that makes the world so attractive to
offworld development.
<P>
Bell-Spiders are six-legged psuedoarachnids that get
their name from their complex webs, which "ring" at
certain frequencies as the wind passes through them,
or when strummed or plucked by the spiders.  Most of
Soonrods aerial fauna navigate and communicate through
the darkened canopies of the forest via a wide
spectrum of sounds in either the low-frequency or
ultrafrequency ends of the sound spectrum. The webs
either attract certain species to their doom, or
disrupt navigation and detection enough to allow the
spiders to ambush or stalk their prey.
<P>
The chemical complexity and diversity of these webs is
amazing, encompassing a range of different polymer and
liquid crystalline types.  Several species create silk
that are many times stronger than the silk of
terrestrial spiders, which is itself three or four
times stronger than steel in tensile strength.  Other
silks have other desirable attributes, including
resistance to acids and moisture, electrical
conductance/resistance, protection against
abrasion..etc.  Most of these properties have useful
industrial and military applications, which explains
why Pentagogue has ownership.
<P>
Most of these silks are unique to the world, and have
either proven too expensive or difficult to
synthesise, replicate through genetic transferrence,
or undesirable to Pentagogues upper management in
their desire to protect trade secrets.  Simple genetic
tweaking can cause significant alterations within the
silk of an individual species, and makes it more cost
effective to farm the spiders on their homeworld than
normal industrial techniques.
<P>
Soonrod has very little industry other than its
"weavers".  Most of the population lives in scattered
harvesting towns near the companies specially equipped
breeding and weaving farms.  Whatever agriculture
exists otherwise is for the raising of plants for the
cultivation of the spiders prey species.  The main
farms are expansive plantations protected by
electronic surveillance and corporate security teams.
These protections are heaviest around experimental or
military oriented farms that produce cutting edge
silks.  Because Pentagogue has a monopoly on this
product certified by the Consulate government, the
price can be exorbitant, which encourages theft
attempts, requiring security around the simplest of
operations.
