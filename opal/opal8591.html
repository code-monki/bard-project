A minor industrial center. The local dictator is
actually chosen at the whims of local business and
cultural leaders, based upon his or her ability to
keep the trains running. In the past the world was
upset by major civil wars between factions in the
military and feuding communities divided over economic
ideology, and the dictatorship is a leftover of the
regimes that ended these wars and unified the world.
Most of the world's power and money are concentrated
in the electing elite, who are not as unpopular or
resented as a cursory examination would indicate.
