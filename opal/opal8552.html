The citizens of Gampin voted against evacuation in a
1133 referendum. Uncertain of their future in the new
Regency, and confident of their chances against
Vampire Fleets, the population opted, by a lopsided
88% to 12% margin, to take their chances outside the
Quarantine. For the first few years of the Quarantine,
the world was left entirely on its own by the Regency
Navy and security services, and Regency popular
opinion was disdainful of the Gampinians. After the
Rape of Trin, the Navy discovered that the locals were
prospering on their own, and Naval patrols frequently
visit the world and its friendly Imperial culture
population.
<P>
Gampin's population lives in several deep rift valleys
near the equator. Here thick forests and rugged
mountains cut off population centers from each other,
and overland travel is difficult to accomplish. The
population subsists on crops and domesticated animals
raised on the valley floors or in nearby mountainside
terraces. A substantial food surplus has always
existed, and the world provides nearly all that is
needed for human survival. Vampire raids have occured,
but none of them have managed to penetrate the highly
effective air defenses that protect these valleys.
