<P>

This is an interpretive update of UWP data in <cite>Regency Sourcebook</cite>.
This is chiefly to explain changes in data that
occured between 1117 and 1202. This section covers
Regency held portions of Trojan Reach.
<P>
This data has been confined to the Regency in light of
the major impact of major events like the Abandonment,
Fait Accompli and the Representational Reforms. The
format goes by subsector, broken down into individual
world entries, which are further divided by 1117 and
1202 UPP data, followed by brief comments on the
reason or mechanism of change, and in some cases a
brief explanation for its current conditions.

<h3>Pax Rulin Subsector</h3> Pax Rulin is bitterly divided.
Several worlds fought off major Ihatei incursions
during the Civil War period, and suffered major
damage. Since then local attitudes towards their new
neighbors have been schizophrenic, being both vengeful
and solicitious. Many worlds are equally comfortable
with trading with the local Aslan, or training and
equipping terrorists and guerillas to attack them. The
situation has not been helped by the fact that several
of the subsectors worlds were partially assimilated
Terran, ROM or Long Night era colonies that were only
nominally controlled by the Third Imperium and the DoD
in the antebellum period.

<H4>Ktaofilr    </h4>    <B>1117:</B> A4699B9-B
       <BR><B>1202:</B>  A4699N9-E         FA<P>

Formerly known as Cyan. The loss of this world to the
Aslan was a major blow to the new Regency government.
Besides an accompanying loss in prestige, the new
Aslan lords were vehemently Anti-Human. They
instituted oppressive practices that slowly drove the
human population from the planet, and to emigrate to
other Regency worlds. Despite major protests by
surrounding worlds, the Regency government did little
to remedy the situation. "Bleeding Cyan" became a
rallying cry for resistance groups on other Fait
Accompli worlds, and a major flashpoint of the
Liberation Riots of the 1160s.

<H4>Doradon     </h4>    <B>1117:</B> A400369-B
        <BR><B>1202:</B>  A400358-F         **<P>

This barren rock recieved its independence right after
the Regency ceded Cyan to the Aslan.  The world's
shipyards were bought out by Spector Ironworks, and is
a major manufacturer of custom built Aslan craft.

<H4>Perrior     </h4>    <B>1117:</B> A633966-B
       <BR><B>1202:</B>  A633986-E         **<P>

Another world that recieved independence in the wake
of Cyan's fall. Perrior has been more amenable towards
the Aslan than most worlds in either Pax Rulin or
Glisten subsectors. Its shipyards are a major source
of starships constructed for the Aslan market,
including the Aslan Quarantine fleet.

<H4>Rhysk       </h4>    <B>1117:</B> E413730-3
        <BR><B>1202:</B>  E413776-7         **<P>



Rhysk and Caraz were originally settled by Solomani
colonists who departed from Earth in sublight craft
during the early years of the Interstellar Wars. By
the time the Third Imperium was founded, its people
had slipped into semi-barbarism, and slowly but surely
they losed the memory and ability to maintain their
habitation domes and life support machinery. Prior to
1033 it had been interdicted by IISS to protect the
local culture, until somebody figured out that if the
Imperium didn't step in to help the colonists out,
there would be no developing culture at all. The
interdiction was lifted, limited contact and trade was
permitted, but local xenophobia slowed the world's
assimilation into the Imperial mainstream. While the
local population is quite friendly with Imperial
culture humans, they react violently towards alien
races. When the Aslan briefly took the world in 1119,
the locals resisted violently. The world has shattered
into factions, and is once again interdicted.




<H4>Thant       </h4>    <B>1117:</B> BAC0789-6
        <BR><B>1202:</B> CAC0589-9         AR<P>

Thant is violently volcanic, and a combination of very
hot temperatures (melting point of lead) and moderate
amounts of Sulfuric acid make this world a difficult
environment to exist in. Aslan forces destroyed
several habitations and the main starport, forcing an
evacuation of 99% of the population.

<h3>Gazulin Subsector</h3> The peace in this subsector is
fragile and subject to constant disruption. Most of
the Regency's Aslan live here, and a couple of worlds
are Fait Accompli. Most of the Liberation forces
present here are the result not so much of Aslan
occupation, but because of its successful resistance
to occupation. Only a few worlds actually fell to the
invaders, thanks to the policies of the subsector
duke, Sharrik Arcadia of Gazulin, which divided the
invading clans against themselves. But the subsequent
failure to completely oust the invaders after the
Collapse embittered local forces, and many worlds
should be considered amber zones for Aslan visitors
and traders.

<P><B>Population (1117/1201):</B> 12.7/102.0 Billion
<BR><B>Industrial Worlds:</B> 3
<BR><B>Mean Tech Level(1117/1202):</B> 12.1/12.8
<BR><B>Senate Contingent:</B> 89

<H4>Labrador    </h4>    <B>1117:</B> B533544-7
      <BR><B>1202:</B> B533589-A         AR<P>

Formerly known as Labora. The world originally lacked
a military beyond lightly armed police, and Aslan
Ihatei overran its defenses rather quickly. The
invaders found very little of worth on the world, and
most of them departed for Glisten, leaving a small
occupation force to control the world. Weapons were
smuggled to the local resistance, and an armed
rebellion overpowered the garrison in 1123. Since
Liberation, the new world military and its attendant
bureaucracy have come to dominate the government. A
good portion of the population are military reservists
to whom weapons are issued by the government. The
locals have proven quite useful for reactionary
elements in the Thinrim, who have hired them for use
against rebellious elements, both Aslan and Humans.

<H4>Fergus      </h4>    <B>1117:</B> B000213-E
       <BR><B>1202:</B> C000355-C         AR<P>

Originally owned by Sternmetal, the colony was overrun
by Aslan Ihatei in mid-1120. After the Ihatei were
ousted, the colony charter was sold to several smaller
companies, former independent contractors native to
the system, trying to profit from the absence of their
larger nemesis.

<H4>Corben      </h4>    <B>1117:</B> B545451-8
        <BR><B>1202:</B> B545410-9         AR<P>

Corben is controlled by Spinward Development Corp.
SDC, otherwise known as Venturprise outside of the
Regency, has been accused of harboring Anti-Aslan
guerillas several times in the past.

<H4>Gazulin     </h4>    <B>1117:</B> AA86987-B
       <BR><B>1202:</B> AA86A96-C         CD/Ab<P>

Gazulin was the recipient of massive offworld
immigration during the Abandonment and the aftermath
of the Rape of Trin. A good portion of its population
came from either Borlund/Lamas, Atadl/Atsah or Trin;
when these groups are combined with some sixteen
billion Aslan, the world is quite volatile, requiring
the government to distance itself from its citizens.

<H4>O'Keefe     </h4>    <B>1117:</B> D879625-7
       <BR><B>1202:</B> D879740-9         AR/CD<P>

O'Keefe is one of several worlds dominated by so
called Liberation Militias. The local culture is
heavily armed, and is a fertile recruiting ground for
Anti-Aslan guerilla and terrorist forces.  Despite
this volunteerist spirit, the local government takes
great pains in ensuring that it is never linked
directly to these activities.

<H4>MacDermont  </h4>    <B>1117:</B> D200768-8
        <BR><B>1202:</B> D200786-9         RR<P>

This world recieved its independence in 1161. The
locals are quite disgusted with the militant culture
that has developed in Gazulin, and take major pains to
prevent weapon shipments through their port.

<H4>Aokhteiho   </h4>    <B>1117:</B> B763773-6
       <BR><B>1202:</B> B7637H4-7         FA<P>

Formerly known as Junction. This world is violently
torn apart between warring Aslan clans, and a human
population driven to vengeful raiding.

<H4>Fintor      </h4>    <B>1117:</B> B440344-7
       <BR><B>1202:</B> B440353-9         AR<P>

Fintor's settlements were severely damaged by the
invading Aslan, and the survivors have "bunkered" down
into fortified camps. Offworlders are actually
subjected to stricter laws than those implied by the
UPP code, and must wear identifying clothing at all
times or risk being arrested or fired upon.

<H4>Bleak       </h4>    <B>1117:</B> C9C6225-9
       <BR><B>1202:</B> C9C6242-B         AR<P>

Bleak has a highly radioactive atmosphere, and was
only colonised to exploit its rich ore beds. The local
community panicked when it heard that the Aslan were
coming in 1120, and fled for Lintl. The Aslan landed a
small party there a few months after they left, which
proceeded no further than the landing berm, before
their commanders decided to look for an easier payoff.

<H4>Hwouealr    </h4>    <B>1117:</B> A560676-A
        <BR><B>1202:</B> A5606K7-B         FA<P>

Formerly known as Mirage. The fractured human
community doesn't seem to notice the Aslan, and
frequently ignore their authority. High surface
temperatures and a lack of potable water sources limit
the occupying aliens to the starport and a few major
settlements, and seem pretty content with the status
quo.

<H4>Fergus    </h4>    <B>1117:</B> E000120-A
        <BR><B>1202:</B> D000241-B         AR<P>

Fergus was resettled by a small community of belters
in 1137. The old research station is defunct, and the
old facilities have been salvaged by the new
colonists. The recent leak of the RASAC archives have
revealed the retention, by the Regency government, of
an auxilliary facility of the old station.  This is a
remote planetoid known as HH-4301, that has been
interdicted by the RQS since about 1145. While
obviously related to Viral research, the exact nature
of this facility is unknown, and unauthorised ship
traffic is prohibited from approaching within 3
million kilometers.

<H4>Ploderash   </h4>    <B>1117:</B> D303696-8
        <BR><B>1202:</B> D303651-A         RR<P>

Ploderash is one of the most extreme cases of
"militantitis" to sweep the Thinrim. Weapon ownership
is mandatory for the entire population, and every
adult must recieve one hundred hours of military
training per year. This is in response to the rapid
collapse of the local military in the face of Ihatei
invaders, and the subsequent sack of the local
starport.  The locals are vehemently Anti-Aslan, but
generally do not export militants to other Fait
Accompli worlds or harass Aslan outside of their own
system.

<h3>Sindal Subsector</h3> The hold of the Third Imperium
over this subsector was tenous at best in Antebellum
times. Aside from Albe, the region was a frontier
backwater that challenged the local authorities, who
were more often than not ignored by the populace. The
predominantly Imperial culture worlds to rim and
spinward were prosperous trading partners, and the
Imperial border was a severe inconvenience to
commerce. The Ihatei invasion of the subsector was
only briefly held up by human resistance, and the
shock of this event has yet to dissapate in the local
mindset. Like so many parts of the Reach, the local
governments are dominated by armed militias that are
themselves outgrowths of Civil War-era resistance
groups. Actual violence against the Aslan, with the
exception of Yewearl, has become quite rare, as new
trading oppurtunities and the massive presence of the
Regency military have defused tensions.

<P><B>Population (1117/1201):</B> 20.3/40.6
<BR><B>Industrial Worlds:</B> 1
<BR><B>Mean Tech Level(1117/1202):</B> 13.9/15.0
<BR><B>Senate Contingent:</B> 32

<H4>Dolberg     </h4>    <B>1117:</B> BAC889D-B
       <BR><B>1202:</B> BAC8850-E         GA/RR<P>

The Regency annexed previously non-aligned Dolberg in
1132, as part of its Final Adjustments. The Aslan
found the world, and its highly "catalytic"
atmosphere, to be highly disagreeable, and willingly
surrendered their control. The pre-war government had
been highly unpopular anyway, and was replaced with
yet another variation of the "militia" governments
that afflict the Thinrim. Local attitudes towards the
Regency were initially cool, but have warmed up as
government investment in its infrastructure and
industrial base have positioned it as a future
industrial power.

<H4>Albe        </h4>    <B>1117:</B> A540A98-E
       <BR><B>1202:</B> A540A52-F         RR<P>

Albe's bureaucratic government disintegrated in the
initial phases of the Aslan siege, and was replaced by
the command councils of local militias that resisted
the invaders semi-successfully.  The local government
is still violently factionalised, and travel between
different territories is fraught with peril. No
unified military exists beyond mutual aid agreements
among the local warlords, and the Regency has had to
step in directly to protect the world against future
Aslan attacks or harassment.

<H4>Realgar     </h4>    <B>1117:</B> B750444-A
  <BR><B>1202:</B> B750435-B         GA/**<P>

Realgar was not as happy as Dolberg at being annexed,
and its government has been keen on isolating Regency
and Aslan migrants in an effort to retain its sense of
sovereignty.

<H4>Yewearl     </h4>    <B>1117:</B> B76A787-7
       <BR><B>1202:</B> B76A7M8-B         GA/FA<P>

Formerly known as Chalchiutlicu. Like Dolberg and
Realgar, this world was non-aligned before being
invaded by the Aslan, and its annexation into the
Regency caused a good deal of controversy with their
Aslan overlords, who felt that Norris had no legal
right or precedent in doing so.  The local human
population is vehemently opposed to the Aslan, and a
low level guerilla war has raged for the last seventy
years.

<h3>Tobia Subsector</h3> Tobia suffered the loss of several
worlds to the Ihatei, but has not suffered the growth
of violent human militias and "self defense" councils
that afflict other Regency subsectors in the Reach.
Much of this can be attributed to the the beneficial
example of its namesake world, and longtime trade and
cultural contacts with the Aslan. Of much more
interest and importance has been the degradation of
several local dictatorships thanks to the
Representational Reforms.

<P><B>Population (1117/1201):</B> 27.4/34.2 Billion
<BR><B>Industrial Worlds:</B> 2
<BR><B>Mean Tech Level(1117/1202):</B> 12.4/14.5
<BR><B>Senate Contingent:</B> 171

<H4>Hwealroh    </h4>    <B>1117:</B> B48668B-9
        <BR><B>1202:</B> B4866KB-E         FA<P>

Formerly known as Pryme. Several past wars and
conflicts with the local human populace has severely
bloodied the local Aslan clans, and the ownership of
weapons has been severely curtailed. Interestingly the
human populace has been quite willing to go along with
these rules, having long tired of the disruptions of
guerilla warfare.

<H4>Yohokh      </h4>    <B>1117:</B> A758400-C
        <BR><B>1202:</B> A7585J7-C         FA<P>

Formerly known as Nekrino. The local humans were too
dispersed and fragmented to resist the invading Aslan.
Most have simply ignored their new overlords, and have
come to dominate them economically.

<H4>Scaladon    </h4>    <B>1117:</B> AAD98DK-A
        <BR><B>1202:</B> AAD98DK-A         EC<P>

This world is ruled by an apocalyptic cult known as
the Prophets of Geynim. The Geynimites enshrined a
number of senseless and cruel rituals into their
liturgy, and a good portion the population was only
too happy to leave as much distance between themselves
and this godforsaken world as the Representational
Reforms would allow them.  The Prophets have largely
ignored the defection of these "apostates", and the
remnant population remains fanatically loyal to their
priests and their idiot cult, a popular choice that
the Regency must respect and abide by.

<H4>Hradus      </h4>    <B>1117:</B> B54699B-7
        <BR><B>1202:</B> A5469B9-D         **<P>

The government underwent a change in order to better
spend the world's development funding.

<H4>Iyulir      </h4>    <B>1117:</B> A350543-B
       <BR><B>1202:</B> A3505N7-E         FA<P>

Formerly known as Saurus.  World is controlled by a
vassal of the Ouokhoi clan (Aokhalte bloc). The world
is a good source for lanthanum ore, and its capture
was a major coup for the invading Aslan.

<H4>Dreadnought </h4>    <B>1117:</B> X78A000-0
        <BR><B>1202:</B> E78A443-8         CD<P>

This world is described in <cite>Regency Sourcebook</cite>. (The E class starport
is my own late modification of the entry.)

<H4>Asilah      </h4>    <B>1117:</B> B520867-6
        <BR><B>1202:</B> B5208L8-A         FA<P>

Formerly known as Imisaa. Though under the control of
the Aokhalte bloc, relations between the Regency and
the local fteirle are better than expected, owing to
the warm relations between the local humans and the
immigrant Aslan.  The world has long ties to Aslan
traders, and unlike most Thinrim worlds, the Fteirle
were tolerated and even welcomed.

<H4>Fist        </h4>    <B>1117:</B> B789430-C
        <BR><B>1202:</B> B789696-D         CD<P>

This cold world became the primary interface with the
Aslan Hierate in 1133. The local landbarons were
intent upon retaining their power, and created an
interlocking bureaucracy to frustrate the immigrants'
attempts at breaking up their monopoly.

<H4>Dimorus     </h4>    <B>1117:</B> D300755-4
        <BR><B>1202:</B> D300761-7         GA<P>

This world's dilapidated pressure domes were further
damaged by Aslan invaders in 1122, and the world
surrendered its sovereignty to nearby Berg in return
for technical assistance.

<H4>Elphinstone </h4>    <B>1117:</B> B687100-A
        <BR><B>1202:</B> B687220-B<P>

Formerly known as Our Planet. The local hunters and
outfitters expanded their operations to attract Aslan
clients, and democratised to pool and disburse the
revenue they were earning.

<H4>Simok       </h4>    <B>1117:</B> DAA08CC-5
        <BR><B>1202:</B> CAA08A5-8         EC/RR<P>

The oppressive planetary council was slow to address
popular grievances, and a significant portion of the
population emigrated to Tobia rather than accept their
continued rule. The commander of the local military,
noticing how Attee (see below) was seriously depleted
for failing to reform, launched a coup in 1156 that
toppled the council.  The removal of oppressive laws,
and the successful opening of the world to outside
development and investment led to the elevation of the
genralissimo into a constitutional monarch in a 1176
referendum. The world is currently ruled by his
daughter.

<H4>Attee       </h4>    <B>1117:</B> C7529AE-4
       <BR><B>1202:</B> B7528AE-5         EC<P>

The local dictatorship refused to believe that the
Representational Reforms would seriously harm its
power. While that is still true, nearly 90% of the
population has emigrated to richer and freer worlds.

<H4>New Moscow  </h4>    <B>1117:</B> B76779A-7
        <BR><B>1202:</B> C7677J8-5         FA/Ab<P>

New Moscow was the target of Ihatei incursions even
before the Imperial Civil War. Bloody fighting
characterised its takeover, and its human defenders
were so severely beaten that they welcomed the
Abandonment with thinly disquised relief.

<H4>Berg        </h4>    <B>1117:</B> A675542-B
        <BR><B>1202:</B> A675575-D         AR<P>

The local population successfully resisted an attack
by Eakhitiyo ihatei in 1123, but were unable to
dislodge them from a fortified position in the
mountains overlooking the downport. A negotiated truce
in 1125 ended the fighting, and the captured landholds
were declared Fait Accompli. After several incidents
between the ihatei factions, and with the human
communities, local law levels were increased to defuse
tensions. Berg is the main connector between Lintl and
Tobia, and the Regency has made it crystal clear to
the locals that a military conflict will not be
tolerated.

<H4>Kedus       </h4>    <B>1117:</B> D867400-3
        <BR><B>1202:</B> D867534-6         CD<P>

Kedus is another important connector world for the
vital trade between the Thinrim and the Stronghold.
The original population of dirt farmers has become
wealthy off of tax proceeds from the overburdened
port, and lord over newer immigrants in a boorish
manner.

<H4>Tobia       </h4>    <B>1117:</B> A444A55-F
        <BR><B>1202:</B> A444A58-F         **<P>

Tobia's tightened law level is due to onworld Aslan
immigration, but not as a discriminatory measure. The
local government is quite solicitous of their new
citizens and their money, and the tighter laws reflect
the local antipathy towards the militarisation of
other Thinrim worlds.

<H4>Batav       </h4>    <B>1117:</B> B5A8764-A
        <BR><B>1202:</B> C5A86J6-8         FA/Ab<P>

Along with New Moscow, Batav was taken by Aslan forces
at the beginning of the Civil War period, but was
partially abandoned when it ended up in the Regency
Frontier. The local Aslan are a surly bunch anyway, as
Batav's cold chlorine atmosphere discourages offworld
contact anyway.
