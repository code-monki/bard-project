Suvfoto is orbited very closely by Ternovo, a 4000
mile diameter rockball. Ternovo originally orbited
much farther out, but a collision with a rogue planet
or massive asteroid dislodged into an elliptical orbit
that allowed to be pulled by the mother world.
Suvfoto had smaller oceans back then, and was slowly
dying seismically. Gravitational drag produced by
Ternovo reactivated the core of the world, producing
fresh tectonic activity.Gravitational stress combined
with local geological conditions creates the necessary
and sufficient requirements for massive earthquakes.
Minor earthquake swarms of Richter 3.5 to 5.0 are the
norm for local seismic conditions.
<P>
The world's old continents are now being pulled apart
by new faulting and subduction. Its oceans have been
widened and deepened by new oceanic ridges and
seafloor volcanism. Colonists arrived in 503 to mine
the massive ore and gem deposits that resulted.  Life
on such an active world is fraught with peril, as
settlements are subject to major earthquakes in nearly
every corner of the world, and tsunamis are frequent
occurences in the local seas. "Moderate" events are
very common. Mutual aid agreement and disaster
assistance, as well as preventative regulations are
stringently enforced by the local government. The
population lives in mostly light, portable structures
that cause little damage or loss of life in case they
are knocked off of their foundations.  Centralised
infrastructure is of little use on this world, and the
daily delivery of water and power by government
operated trucks is the center of daily routine. Most
settlements are connected by sea or air, and the
downport is located in soft sand in a local desert to
shock absorption.
