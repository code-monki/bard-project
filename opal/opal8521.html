This cold rock is home to a loose assemblage of
eccentrics. The locals are several wealthy families
that colonised this barren rock following the Solomani
Rim War. They objected to what they percieved was the
growing conformity and acceptance of tyranny by the
Imperial mainstream, and moved here to live free of
the fetters of Imperial authority. The groups ideology
became a casualty of its own success, however. The
families quickly squared off against each other over
issues of civic responsibility, privacy and provision
of services. Eventually each family "seceeded" from
their fellows by sealing off their quarters from their
neighbors, and asking the Imperial authorities to
recognise their individual claims of sovereignty.

The single settlement surrounds the starport,
radiating outwards on a series of spokelike
underground passages that are only connected at the
hub. Antebellum visitors were confined to the starport
extrality limit, and had to apply for visas to visit
each individual commune. Each commune would then send
armed escorts to retrieve "approved" visitors. The
extrality limits were lifted by the Representational
Reforms, and now each commune must secure against
unwanted intrusion at their own boundaries. The real
reason for this excessive security is for privacy. The
libertarian impulse has been eroded by the burgeoning
wealth of the locals, who are mostly professionals
tied into the economy on nearby Urnas. The world is
now essentially a private estate or vacation home for
the original settlers, and most of the population is
now transient in nature.
