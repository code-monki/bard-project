Ninox was one of the four worlds colonised from nearby
<a href="opal9343.html">Titan</A> during its economic struggle with the Torinsk
cluster. While the four worlds have remarkably similar
UPPs and living conditions, they were each settled for
different reasons, and have significantly different
cultures and local prevailing conditions as a result.
Ninox was perhaps the least valuable of the four. The
world's asteroid belt was mostly silica and ice of
little intrinsic value, and had few other resources
worth exploiting.  And Ninox being on the far side of
Titan away from Torinsk, little impetus existed for
the colony to be maintained, especially as the life
support costs for all four were a challenge for even a
rich world such as Titan to upkeep.
<P>
Ninox itself is a barren, hot world with an atmosphere
too thin to breathe without mechanical assistance.
Much of the world became a junkyard for Titan, who
used it to store industrial wastes, or as a
manufactory that handled or processed dangerous
substances.  It also became a dumping ground for
outdated and worn out machinery, including starships.
Ninoxians became highly skilled, thanks to their work
in these huge "heaps" in salvage and recovery, and
many were paid top credit for recovery operations for
Avalar corps and the Navy.
<P>
By the 940s Titan decided to jettison Ninox to lighten
the load on its treasury. The locals recieved short
notice of the impending change. For many first notice
of new independence came when the Highburian
constabulary embarked on transports, and never
returned.  This cavalier treatment, so typical of
Titan, engendered resentment among the locals, and it
became the focus of their efforts in forming a new
government. Ever since relations between Titan and her
orphan daughter have been chilly and sometimes
hostile.
<P>
Unfortunately, Ninox still had no industry of its own
in the wake of independence, and was forced to take
Titan's leavings for itself.  The one small advantage
Ninox had was the massive solar output of Killumina,
its F7II primary, and with Titan money solar powered
factory satellites were placed in the inner zone to
take full advantage of the cheap energy.  These
facilities were constructed with TL-9 and 10 standards
and equipment, and mostly produced TL 6-10 products
for export. These facilities were moderately, though
not extravagantly profitable, and the local population
enjoyed a meager yet comfortable lifestyle. The only
blemish was the continued sulleness of the locals for
their Titan employers, and the resentment at the
complicity of the local police and security services
in protecting their property.
<P>
Ironically, the demise of Titan's old government in
its Civil War was a boon for Ninox. Before, a good
portion of their factories profit had been sent back
to Titan. In the wake of the War's outbreak the Ninox
government nationalised the factories, assisted by
secured financing from several Regency immigrant
groups. While the market for mid-tech goods has
slumped in recent years, and as spare parts for the
factories have become hard to come by in spite of the
locals skills, the world has continued to prosper.
Mostly because of its efforts in salvage and recovery
operations in devastated regions of Titan, and its
assistance of certain Titan city-states in effecting
their recovery. Unlike Pudimon, the Ninox government
and their salvage teams have been completely
above-board, and have used the resulting goodwill to
acquire new industry.
