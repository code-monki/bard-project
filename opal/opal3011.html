During the collapse and the turmoil that followed it's unpopular dictator Heri Smales 
was killed, and the apparatus of government torn down. Anarchy ruled for years, except 
on the island of Krenna, where the former Imperial Scout Base was located. This base 
escaped the worst effects of the collapse, and had been quite large, dealing with 
demographic and technological matters in the subsector and adjacent subsectors in the 
Hinterworlds, which required some covert work.<P>

With civilisation falling in pieces around her, Braw-app-uh-arr, the Newt administrator 
of the base decided that it was best to retrench, and allow the tree of wisdom to grow
from the Base, through the island, and eventually to cover the planet. With the help of 
the members of the Covert Survey teams she 'camouflaged' the base from orbital survey, and
recovered what technical equipment she could from the ruins on the mainland.<P>

By 1145, the tech level of Voskl was about 6, with petty warlords fighting their 
wars over the face of the planet. Krenna's Tech Level had stabilised at 9, and was 
aggressively defending it's territory.<P>

An attempted invasion in 1153 by an alliance of warlords called 'The Rule of Might' was
quickly contained, and wiped out with the advanced equipment available to the Scout 
Base. Braw-app-uh-arr's successor, Altrina Derin launched a covert war against the 
alliance, striking only at the Hierarchy of the Alliance, and the states therein. This
'Decapitation' policy led to the states of Gordon's Kingdom, Rule of Order, and 
Franzen's Reach falling, to be replaced by governments allied to Krenna. One of these,
'The Gernan People's Polity' started expanding aggressively into the regions still 
controlled by the warlords, and in 1159 was the target of a pre-emptive nuclear strike by 
The Rule of Might. <P>

Krenna's response was fast and furious, striking almost all of the Warlords' important
military facilities. The covert response took longer, but on 213-1160, Scout teams 
kidnapped most of the Warlords in furious assaults on their strongholds. Three days later
their trials started for Crimes against Civilisation, whilst their realms were being 
steered from chaos by Scout political teams. The verdict was, as expected, guilty. Derin
sentenced them to be 'judged' by the people of Gernan. Those that lived after their 
judgement did not live well.<P>

By 1164, the world was almost exclusively under the control of governments allied to 
Krenna, and it started to meld them into provinces under it's overall control. In a way, 
the nuking of Gernan was a blessing in disguise, for it was so thankful for the aid the 
Scout's provided in it's reconstruction that it's people were willing to enter into any 
agreement with them, no matter what their government really wanted to do. <P>

At the end of the 1180's the world was now one, under the beneficent rule of the Scouts.
The tech level of the planet as a whole was 9, and what TL-A equipment could be salvaged 
was recovered. The Scouts realised that more was needed. They had the ability to repair 
and maintain much higher tech equipment with the facilities at it's base and the records 
of its Technical Assessment Centre, but to obtain such equipment it would need to expand 
out from the system and find trading partners.<P>

By 1193 it had refurbished the starport and all the ships it could on the planet, and 
Scout teams headed out into the subsector. They found a lot of worlds in the grasp of
Technical Warlords, much like those who had been defeated on their homeworld. Five 
planets on the Acrolund - Voskl Main showed potential, and were asked to join a trade
alliance led by Voskl, all agreed, eager to obtain Voskl's hi-tech equipment. By 1197
it had contacted five other worlds that it could trade profitably with, and the current 
<A HREF="../peri/peri0007.html">Voskl Trade Alliance</a> was completed.<P>

Most of the Trade in the alliance is performed by two 'Spiderweb' Large Jumpframes, and
one 'Grappler' Small Jumpframe. All are owned by Voskl.<P>

Her Navy consists of 2 Chrysanthemum Destroyer Escorts, 2 Valor Missile Corvettes, 11 
Fiery Close Escorts, 2 Broadsword Mercenary Cruisers, 5 Shukugan SDBs, 2 Patrol Cruisers
and 3 Scout/Couriers. The Scout/Couriers are in the process of being transferred to the
Alliance Scout Service, recently set up in 1201. The Scout Service already has 5 ex-Navy
Scout/Couriers, as well as 3 ex-Navy Donosev Survey Ships.<P>

Currently Voskl had managed to raise the TL of Krenna to B using equipment scavenged 
from
Malcan, Rusco and Horejis. The spaceport is now capable of handling the annual 
maintenance
of Starships as easily as a 'B' class facility, and the Scout Base is now turning out
'Torch' Space Fighters at the rate of 2 a month. Voskl is very close to upgrading the 
Starport to 'B' standard. How good this facility will be will depend on what relics can 
be found to upgrade it.<P>

There is a controversy at the minute over plans to refit the Scout Cruiser Shadow, the
Scout Advisory Council want it operational to investigate the Free Trader rumours of an
Empire at the rimward end of the Expanses, but Merchants fear that it will divert
resources from the vital Jumpframes.
