<HR>
     Gethsemene is a habitable world, but a little hot, owing to its
close orbit about its G1 V primary. Before the collapse it was home to a 
small religious group, the Brotherhood of Sentients, who believed that 
all intelligent species were equal and sacred and should be united in one 
giant interstellar community. The Brethren pursued an agrarian lifestyle, 
and were seperated into several small communes around the starport.
<P>
        Gethsemene was untouched by the war, but its population plummeted 
during the Hard Times, the people fleeing to safer havens in the face of 
continued Reaver attacks. The starport fell into disuse as trade dried up, 
and the remaining inhabitants (a small group of hard-core believers) faced 
an increasingly dismal life as the tech level crashed. Their life was made 
worse when a pirate crew, their ship failing due to Virus infection, 
decided to make their home here. The Brotherhood member's attempts at 
passive resistance quickly ceased after the first few crucifictions, and 
the natives became virtual slaves to the newcomers.
<P>
        Today, Gethsemene is it's own tiny despotism; the "Captain"
and his bodyguard ruling by force and fear from the shutdown pirate 
vessel on which their ancestors arrived. Any resistance to their rule 
by the serfs is punished by death, the method of which varies depending 
on the Captain's whim. Traders are not welcomed, either by the Captain, 
who sees them as a possible threat to his rule, or by the serfs, who know
that they can bring only trouble.
<P>
