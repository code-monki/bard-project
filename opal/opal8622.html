Mater Nova is subject to very active volcanism,
generally basaltic floods that engulf large areas of
the surface. Massive lava flows give the nightside a
characteristic glow that is easily noticeable from far
orbit. These flows are unstable after cooling, and are
quickly eroded away by water and wind. The world gets
its name from this everchanging and evolving
landscape. Some mining is done, but exploitation of
the world is difficult to accomplish, and agriculture
is nearly impossible with the constant threat of
lavaflows.
<P>
Potable water is in short supply on this world,
volcanic eruptions confine the population to a small
number of coastal cities. Ninety percent of the local
economy is generated by traffic transiting from the
Spinward Main to nearby Sabine subsector.
