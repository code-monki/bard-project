Bisistra is often referred to as "tony suburb." The
local states are all descended from an ecologically
oriented group of colonists that settled here in 187.
But disaggreements and historical developments divided
the group into warring factions. Most of these
disaggreements, according to offworld historians, were
petty disputes collected under the category of "bad
Feng Shui."  The locals are artistic snobs, and they
went through major pains to aesthetically secede from
each other, with each colony taking on a different
philosophical or artistic direction.
<P>
Since that time real economic and political disputes
have entered the picture, and the artists have been
supplemented by heavily armed mercenary soldiers.
Some common cause projects like the colonising of
Gatooma (Deneb 1730) and the threat of Virus have
emerged from time to time, but the level of local
hatred and disdain is quite heavy. Each colony
maintains its own seperate downports, and
intercommunal contact is limited to the highport, as
most trade and contact are not permitted across their
shared borders. One major impediment to unity is the
high standard of living possessed by each community;
wealth is generated by individual efforts and not by
communal cooperation. Unless there is a major crisis
or disaster, it is unlikely that this status quo will
be interrupted.
