Frozen Prolam has been an instrumented military test
range and proving grounds since its colonization in
1012. The world is a glistening white ball, and
visiting military personnel have christened it "Old
Cue Ball." In conjunction with nearby Ansirk, the
world continually hosts military exercises, manuevers
and training exercises for military and RQS units from
across the Regency. The cold weather environment is
perfect for survival training, and it is one of the
main training bases for Regency special ops forces and
intelligence operatives.
<P>
Prolam's population lives in orbit, leaving the world
itself almost entirely unpopulated. An extensive array
of research and development labs used to dot the world
itself, but security concerns prompted their
relocation during the early days of the Collapse. One
of the more interesting features of the world are the
boneyards of grounded ships, all of them captured by
Imperial, Domain or Regency forces in the last three
hundred years of war; these vessels are used to
familarize Marine assualt units in the layouts of
those ships most likely to be encountered in military
operations.
