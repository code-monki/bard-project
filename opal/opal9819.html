The Grudovo Pendant is a j-1 cluster of 13 worlds that
connects Tobia/Trojan Reach with neighboring
Usher/Reft. Originally a cluster of little economic
presence or importance, its economic value has risen
in proportion with the rising volume of trade that
passes between Lintl and Tobia.<P>


<P>

Most of the population lives in a cluster of
underground cities located near the downport, and
access the worlds mines through underground tunnels
excavated through the centuries. Large parts of the
world remain poorly explored except by satellite. The
current Queen of Simok, Robyn Hadirgari, is an
upstanding and vocal proponent of her world and
people, and has done much to reverse centuries of
xenophobia and fear encouraged by the old regime.
