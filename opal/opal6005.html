Formerly the site of a Large Solomani Base, this system still
throws up some interesting relic equipment for use at home. By far the
most famous find was that of the Solomani Light Cruiser <I>Arrogance</I> which was found powered down near the outer gas giant of the system. The crew
had managed to halt the Viral penetration of their systems, but the Virus
had vented their fuel as a final act of revenge. The remaining crew drew
lots, those that won went into cold sleep in the available low
berths. The others dealt with their situation. The ship's firsts officer,
Marianne Kwaligen is now the current commander of this formidable vessel.
The system is the main entry point of Hiver Convoys to the Pact.
Facilities are sparse though, and Convoys usually jump on to Gammist or
Yoryunssoy.
