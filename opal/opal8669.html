Ashasi is the sole free standing world in its system,
as all of its neighbors are gas giants. But it would
stand out on its own in spite of its neighborhood. The
atmosphere of Ashasi is so thick that it forms its own
sea. Originally a mixture of nitrogen, water vapor and
carbon dioxide, chemosynthesising microbes have
generated more free Oxygen since the worlds genesis.
The resulting gas mix can support multicellular life,
albeit not human or terrestrial life. Crushing
pressures prevent most sentients from alighting to the
planetary surface, and even Virushi have a difficult
time at lower altitudes without an aspirator. The
atmosphere turns to "soup" about 20 miles above the
surface, and most of the worlds habitats float above
the ground at this level. <P>

Turbulence and temperature pockets create foamy
"clouds" that scatter light and darken vision below
this level, and the sky is boiling cauldron of grey
and black. A variety of atmosphere swimming plants and
animals have evolved from the world's original
microbial life, and some of these can grow to
gargantuan proportions. Some species have evolved into
giant sessile colonial lifeforms that float freely on
the air, resembling airborne islands to which other
life anchors and flourishes. Because of the thickness
of the atmosphere, dead tissue and wastes from these
animals, as well as corpses, float in midair until
they are consumed by scavengers, forming the base of a
large biological pyramid.
<P>
The original Vilani inhabitants colonised the world in
the waning days of the old Ziru Sirka, just before the
Terrans had fully conquered their empire. These people
were refugees from increasing disorder in the face of
Vargr invasions into Corridor, and Ashasi seemed a
good place to fortify against further raids. Few such
raids occured, however, and the colonists concentrated
on adapting to their new environment. Despite the
challenge of local conditions the colonists flourished
through their hard work and organisation. At the level
that they built their communities, local temperatures
and pressures are within human norms, allowing for
normal outdoor industries like agriculture to funtion.
<P>
They built huge artificial islands to float on air
with such care and diligence that many of the original
habitats continue to function to this day. The
earliest of these habitats were temporary structures
constructed out of the colonisation ships. These were
replaced with islands made out of a long lasting
polymer reinforced with ceramic structural supports.
Because of their hydrodynamic design and passive
stabilisation systems, they were stable enough to
construct normal communities on the flattened upper
surface in a manner that made them resemble an island.
As Ashasi's population grew, more advanced
self-contained designs similiar to orbital habitats
were constructed.
<P>
The colony was contacted by the Rule of Man in -1907.
Relations with the upstart empire were cool, though
trade was permitted. The fall of the ROM in -1776
ended this contact, and the colonists were isolated
behind the claw for the next 1100 years. The world was
recontacted in year 47 IC, and was reincorporated into
the Third Imperium in 49 IC. The Vilani population was
insular, having survived on their own for centuries
without outside help, and never acquired a taste for
much offworld contact. It was a reliable, if absent,
citizen of the Third Imperium. Aside from a few
unusual industrial goods and animal products, the
world had little to trade anyway. Most offworld
visitors were tourists who came to marvel at the
world, its ecosystem, and its unique society.
<P>
Ashasi suffered from the Panic of 1140, which saw a
major portion of its population flee for worlds deeper
in the Safe following the Kishkii's attack. This
rupture of its traditional taciturness made it more
willing to deal with offworlders, and its starport and
visitor facilities have been improved to foster more
trade. Unlike the Vargr of the distant past, Virus is
more prone to streetfighter tactics, where weapons of
mass destruction are launched against high value
targets by guerilla style units. The cloud cities of
Ashasi are highly vulnerable to nuclear or EMP
airbursts, or kamikaze attacks. This has created a
substantial presence of Regency Army and light Naval
units that man the newly acquired planetary defenses.
