Upuraku is one of the few naturally habitable worlds
in Gulf Subsector. Unfortunately the world has been
undergoing an ice age for the last 2000 years, and
useableland area is limited to the tropics. The world
has attracted considerable migration since the
Collapse, including several Aslan clans that farm the
western continent. Because of the myriad divisions
that exist between the world's communities, an
effective central government does not exist. Instead
an individual community is elected by plebiscite every
four years to act as a nominal capitol in interstellar
affairs.
<P>
The local scout base is one of the largest in the
sector, and is used primarily as a dumping ground for
out of service or decommisioned scout ships and X-Web
craft. Twice a year the Scouts and RQS hold an auction
that sells off vessels surplus for their needs
(translation: crap too old or worthless to maintain)
to interested parties. While most of these ships are
barely flyable, they are often recycled or upgraded by
enterprising worlds or companies that otherwise have
too low a priority to draw new vessels or maintain
their existing fleets.
