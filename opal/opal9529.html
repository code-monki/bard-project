"Yelim" is Te-Zlodh for "pioneer." The world was
terraformed by pre-Maghiz Darrians to increase the
worlds surface atmospheric pressure, and a slight,
still extant sulfuric taint is evidence of those
efforts. Yelim was settled for its extensive mineral
resources, and to provide additional agricultural
resources for the homeworld and the other colonies.
<P>
The world was isolated by the Maghiz, and was lucky
enough that most of the terraformation process was
complete when the EM wave from Tanis arrived, so there
was no loss of life due to the planets
uninhabitability.  By the time the world was
recontacted by Mire, it had developed extensive
agricultural regions, and the world was instrumental
in aiding the recovery of the Confederation through
its export of cheap foodstuffs.
<P>
Yelim is dominated by a small council of industrial
landlords, mostly corporate executives that control
most of the planets industry and agricultural land.
The world's law level is pretty low, and the council
doesn't govern much beyond guaranteeing its monopoly
over the planets economic base.  Below these lords, a
complicated pyramid of local suzerains and chieftains
handle administrative affairs, seeing to the needs of
the common citizens with only some outside support.
<P>
The world is only a few decades away from becoming an
industrial world in its own right. The local
government has encouraged this growth through careful
investment, and occaisonal invitations to outside
companies to set up plant and join the governing
council. Since the Collapse a number of outside firms
have had this honor extended to them: LSP, General
Products, Prynde Metals, Grand Design, Oberlindes and
Spinakker. Yelim has also become very heavily
concentrated in the manufacture of TL 9-11 vehicles
and transportation components, and heavy military
products as well.  The government hopes to intensify
this activity by increasing the local technological
base to construct the higher TL goods that are in more
demand within the Confederation and the Regency.
<P>
A number of obstacles have arisen to upset these
plans. Several ecological groups have objected to the
scope of these plans, and they have a significant base
of support among the locals who fear that the planet
will become an industrial eyesore. On the opposite
side, the industrial expansion has tested the councils
control over the planet, as development and increasing
prosperity has brought in groups of outsiders, from
company execs to the new and growing middle class,
that has challenged the councils tightfisted control
over life on the planet.
