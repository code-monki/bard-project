Dhapura is almost completely covered in sulfurous,
blue-green oceans. Its cold air temperatures are
allayed in part by large scale oceanic volcanism that
creates large patches of warm water. Algae and sea
life thrive, and the local population is
self-sufficient in food. The world's unusual volcanic
activity is due to natural activity amplified by
Ancient manipulation. Located near the world's equator
in 150 to 250 meter deep water is one of the most
dramatic Ancient sites ever discovered in the former
Imperium.
<P>
Known as the "Ancient Atlantis" it is a collection of
massive entryless buildings carved out of local
basalt, set on a foundation of "paving stones" made
out of ceramic that mass up to 50,000 tons. Unusual
channels and flutes are inlaid into this foundation,
which isn't the usual horizontal plane, but moves
along with the terrain in a flowing style, often
creating billowing arches, tunnels and ravines that
look organic in shape and function.  Instruments have
recorded unusual magnetic fields and water currents
that are contrary to the world's own nature. Most of
the buildings are not anchored to any kind of
foundation, and several are buoyant enough to move
under certain current conditions, though they remain
confined to Atlantis. Bizarre, brightly lit polyhedral
shapes known as "Tumblers" often spontaneously appear
in the area around Atlantis; these appear to be some
kind of energy field of plasma and water that moves in
an end over end fashion. Their purpose is unknown.
<P>
Geologists note that the world became seismically more
active at the same time as the Ancient settlement,
though whether they're responsible for this increase
activity or simply took advantage of its is unknown.
Unlike most Ancient sites, this one was undamaged by
the Final War; it was abandoned after a series of
major earthquakes caused subsidence, collapsing
several areas, and inundating the entire facility with
higher water levels. The entire site was cleared out,
leaving only its enigmatic buildings and some
interesting garbage piles for future archaeologists.
<P>
The local population subsists on fishing, and lives on
rocky limestone islets located in the warmer
equatorial regions. Large ice sheets form above the
tropic lines during the winter, and navigation is made
hazardous in the spring by the subsequent breakup into
icebergs. Water temperatures can erode these ice
sheets, and create rapid breakups even during the
winter. Treacherous local currents known as Hellbores
are created near the islands by differences in
undersea temperatures. No unified government exists
beyond a council of local chieftains that mostly
mediates conflicts between the local communities and
distributes revenues from offworld trade. The locals
have traditionally been a surly lot, but have warmed
up to offworld contact since Atlantis was opened up to
tourists and submersible tour companies.
