Wakato takes its name from an obscure Solomani
Japanese phrase that means "people of the harmonious
song." The world is a gas giant moon with a peculiar
atmosphere. It orbits the gas world at close
proximity.  So close in fact that the gas giants
magnetic field carries down to Wakato past its own
magnetic field through the polar regions. As a person
proceeds from the equator towards either pole, the
ground and air become progressively magnetised.  This
magnetic charge never exceeds what a human can
tolerate.  But it does create an excess of negative
ions in the air, water and biosphere that can have
severe psychoactive effects upon human beings.
<P>
Depending upon the person, short-term exposure can
induce depression, nausea, fatigue, loss of appetite
and listlessness. People who have become acclimated
after about a local year are unusually passive,
inoffensive and uncurious, and often show extreme
giddiness or ecstatic reverie in regards to their
homeworld.  The locals are known to offworlds as
either "hummers" or "deads" for their habit of lapsing
into humming or muttered singing.  The locals for
their part consider offworlders to be rude and
destructive dolts, and the most passionate and extreme
among them consider themselves as being active
participants in some kind of cosmic song that
manifests on their homeworld. Because of the nature of
this "taint" normal containment features do not
function, and no real system beyond expensive
degaussing equipment exists to remove these ions from
the air, though starship air plants do a good job.
<P>
In the past the Avalar Consulate used to imprison its
most difficult dissidents on Wakato, using its calming
effects to neutralise their threat to communal peace,
and as a means of cheap sedation.  Psychiatric
facilities bent towards short term convalescent care
are still in abundance on the world, as are resorts
for stressed out executives and workers. Weight loss
centers take advantage of the worlds supression of
appetite Long term residence for offworlders is not
recommended, as the world has compelled many people to
stay beyond what is considered to be a therapeutic
duration.
<P>
Most of the locals are functional, but do little
physical labor or repetitive work, as the hypnotic
effect of the atmosphere can induce fatal inattention.
As a result the world is mostly automated with robotic
systems doing nearly all physical work and even
transport.  Naturally the locals are indifferent to
politics, and the only real governmental system are
the observance of basic laws, discussions on technical
and economic matters, and the embedded principles
within the worlds automated systems.  Most of the
world's economy consists of truck farms, tourism and
some light industry of handmade crafts exported or
sold to the tourists.
<P>
Wakato has a low reputation among other Avalars.  The
world's narcotic effects and zoned out populace have
earned it the moniker "where the new age begins."
People who heavily frequent the place for recreational
purposes are frequently stigmatised within normal
society, and are often scrutinised for abnormal
behavior or hospitalization.  The Consulate government
no longer ships dissidents to the world, but several
world governments are now using the vacated prison
facilities for their own long-term and life sentence
prisoners, and this has created a vital additional
industry for this wacky world.
