New Colchis was colonised around 560 by exiles from
Colchis. These were a collection of different
socialist utopian groups whose carious ideologies
shared a common interest in a perfectible industrial
society. After failing to impress their views on their
homeworld, they settled here to impose their ideology
unhindered by prejudice and percieved inequalities.
Despite hot temperatures and a shortage of certain
resources, New Colchis was settled in a very short
time, although power struggles between the different
factions often slipped into bloody conflict and
purges.

<P>
Socialism, as one ancient Solomani writer once put it,
is a government system that increases the scope and
power of the state, while drastically removing the
restraints against abuse.  With no outside threats to
unify them, internal struggles between the various
factions turned the regime into a police state.
Consensus could only be forged through extralegal
mechanisms within the huge bureaucracy, and only
bureaucrats and secret policemen could rule this
unwieldly heap.  Industrial development was centrally
imposed, and always state's benefit. Complaints over
poor living conditions and oppressive practices were
muted by the looming presence of the security services
and the threat of purge or imprisonment.

<P>
Serendip's takeover of the world in the 990s was a
milestone for the world government, precariously
balanced between increasingly strident factions in the
military, industry and police bureaucracy.  The new
vistas opened up by the arrival of Imperial jump drive
technology promised a means of satisfying everyone's
greed at the same time. Overnight it transformed
itself from the most isolationist of worlds into the
most expansionistic.  And they were hellbent on
surpassing the colonial ambitions of every other
competitor.  Even before the Islands War, its agents
were aggressive and ruthless in their search for
colonies.

<P>
The Islands War was a disaster for New Colchis. Its
habit for ruthlessness led it into an alliance with
New Home, and the two of them inflicted massive damage
to their enemies through planetary strike operations.
In retaliation, Serendip and Joyeuse struck New
Colchis even harder. Half of the world's industry,
energy production and infrastructure were destroyed,
and today large parts of the world are at
preindustrial levels without power or utilities, and
people must live at subsistence levels.  Large parts
of the world are in a state of arrested anarchy, and
the government is increasingly consumed with renewed
internal struggles. The rest of the world is suffering
from its neglect, and a vicious cycle of decay is
slowly destroying this world and its people.
