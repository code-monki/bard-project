<h3>Overview</h3> Xenough is a barren, bone dry rock along the
former trailing border of the Avalar Consulate, in its
namesake subsector. Despite its hospitable atmosphere,
the world is blazingly hot, even hotter than Titan,
and water would boil away in the early morning sun. Of
no intrinsic value, the world attracted colonists
largely by accident. The population it acquired lived
in horrible conditions and abject poverty, subject to
the terrible weather and scorching climate. Instead of
breaking them, adversity hardened their resolve and
propelled them to innovation. Driven by the spectre of
famine or death by thirst, the colonists and their
descendants organised themselves into a tight and
cohesive society, directed by a social hiearchy unique
to Charted Space. Eventually the colonists challenged
the supremacy of the nearby Avalar Consulate, earning
great respect from their economic rivals. This
worthless planet has become a formidable economic and
financial player within the Consulate and much of
Foreven Sector.
<P>
<h3>Astrography</h3> Avalar is the fifth world in orbit around
Reneaudol, a main sequence F7V star. The solar system
has a severe shortage of water on all of its worlds
within its seventh orbit. It is thought that the
system's water sources (cometary ice) was mostly
cannibalised by gravitational accretion by the
outermost gas giants of Pernaud and Ursula.
Astronomers have also detected a smaller than usual
Kuiper and Oort fields, possibly due to gravitational
attraction from other nearby stars. Aside from a few
of Ursula's moons, no surface water exists insystem,
and most water for human or industrial consumption is
harvested by slow ion-drive tankers that slowly wend
their way through the outer system.
<P>
Aside from the water shortage, the Reneaudol system is
also short of metals in sizeable concentrations, again
due to gas giant accretion. The innermost worlds of
Grevy and Nanette are likely asteriodal in origin,
remnants of the long obliterated planetismal fields.
What metals are in adequate concentration are mostly
heavy metals in scattered deposits. But for the most
part the systems worlds are mostly dull silica of no
intrinsic industrial use.
<P>
<h3>Geology</h3> Xenough is a dead rock. The  world's low
geothermal gradient meant less volcanic recycling than
normal occured, keeping metals and other heavier
elements needed for the development for life from
reaching the surface. The lack of tectonic development
also prevented much surface water in any significant
concentrations. That is not to say that the world has
no geological history. At one time a simple ecosystem
of primitive plant life dominated the few shallow
oceans that developed. The standard O2 atmosphere is
the sole relic of this past. The oceans have long
since dried up or filled with sediment, and the
ecosystem became extinct. Many of the sediment basins
have become rich sources of hydrocarbons, mostly heavy
"kerogen", a tarry kerosene-rich substance that is
still extracted for a variety of local industrial
processes.<P>
Xenough enjoys very little surface relief. Which is
funny way of saying that the world is as flat as a
pancake.  Erosion by wind and what little water ever
existed had reduced the worlds mountain ranges to sand
covered remnants (known as Inselbergs) that barely
rise above the shifting sand or seas of featureless
sediment. Most of the planet is essentially sand
choked valleys and plains, with an occasional
depression or meteorite crater to break up the
monotony. Surface water is virtually non-existent
except for small sheets of ice that form on the night
side, or in deep caves where some remnant volcanic
activity exists.
<P>
The world's relatively rapid rotation creates some
major complications for the local population. Massive
sandstorms continually whip the world, many of them
with hurricane intensity within the tropical
latitudes. The storms can raise surface temperatures
to about 150 degrees centigrade, and cover the planet
with choking clouds of stinging sand. Exposed surfaces
like metal and glass and can literally be sanded away
in a few short years, and most native vehicles and
clothing are specially constructed to resist this
hazard. Even more dangerous is the massive electrical
fields generated by these storms: past instances of
explosions in fuel tanks and generators have been well
documented.
<P>
<h3>Geography</h3> A joke not worth repeating.  Without
navigation satellites or other modern aids, one could
circumnavigate the world without ever knowing it. Few
natural landmarks exist for reckoning, and many of
those that do exist are mostly found in the horse
latitudes around 30 degrees, and are mostly covered by
sand ergs. Most landmarks are man-made, generally
large styilised obelisks and towers built at critical
locations for no other reason than to break up the
monotony.
<P>
Most of the population lives in the upper latitudes of
the northern and southern hemispheres.  The world's
greater than normal axial tilt still makes
temperatures in these regions excrutiating during the
deep summer and winter months. But at least some
variety exists compared to the relentless heat of the
lower latitudes. The habitated zones are massive
conurbations of shallow subterranean cities, marked by
huge towers and man made promontories designed to
divert and harness lightning during sandstorms. The
distance between them is marked by odd
"infrastructure" of metal and plastic, constructed to
suggest utilities and transportation arteries, though
in fact they are completely useless.
<P>
The population is evenly divided between the northern
and southern halves. While Xenough's capitol city,
Faraplenaz, is located in the northern hemisphere, no
significance is assigned to its placement. The world's
six A-class starports are evenly divided, and industry
is not concentrated in any one area. The entire
population, with the exception of specially assigned
government and scientific personnel, resides in these
cities only. No other community exists except for
lonely weather, military and research outposts in the
remote outback.
<P>
Xenough's cities are of an unusual design for
subterranean facilities. Rather than the normal
tunnels excavated from the bare rock that form a
warren of descending layers, these are constructed in
large vaults. The cities generally started out as
small mining pit under a large shade dome, and the pit
was expanded radially as the population grew.  The
cities resemble an inverted pyramid, with a taper
towards the bottom.  Most of the lower castes,
associated industry and agriculture, and utilities and
water reclamation plants, are located at the highest
levels, and as one descends into the pit, the more
comfortable and refined the surroundings become, until
one reaches the bottom layers inhabited by the
managerial castes. Most of the population lives in
apartment blocks that radiate away from the central
pit in tunnels, as temperatures in the central shaft
can be intolerable as one goes higher towards the
surface.  The purpose of this construction is
generally for heat transfer away from the lowest
layers, allowing naturally cooled air to percolate to
the base at night and early morning, and keeping
environmental cooling to a minimum.
<P>
<h3>Culture</h3> Xenough, and its colonies on Mahir, Torinsk
and Hepring, are dominated by a rigid caste system.
The terrible lack of water, and the stifling heat
forced the early colonists on Xenough to organise
their communities to permit the most equitable
division of resources as possible. Given the harsh
environmental conditions, individual advanncement was
secondary to the survival and advancement of the
community.  The entire population was divided, by
profession, into several different castes arranged
according to their importance.  Unlike the Hindu caste
system, which is its inspiration, the Xenough "Kopol"
system is arranged more upon socialistic lines, with
each caste being more akin to a guild or political
groupment than a mere social dumping ground.
<P>
Or more simply, Xenough is a vast bureaucracy divided
along caste lines.  By definition everyone is a public
employee, albeit in a hereditary manner.  Every aspect
of life on Xenough is under the control of a
government monopoly regulated by an interlocking set
of vertical and horizontal hiearchies. Every
profession is the province of a caste. Every
enterprise has a seperate hiearchy that runs from
lowly sanitation workers to upper caste management
personnel. Every caste has legally mandated rights and
priveleges, similar to medieval guild societies.
Xenough has seven identifiable castes:
<P>
<b>Rakhman:</b> Upper Management. This breaks down into three
subcastes: Planetary, Civic and regional Rakhmans. The
Planetary leadership is a council of just ten major
families, the descendants of those who came to
dominate Xenough early in its history. Civic Rakhmans
are usually either solitary autocrats or fraternal
oligarchs that dominate each city, which is divided
according to the Planetary Council, the Syndicrate.
Regional Rakhmans control inter-city utilities,
infrastructure and businesses. The Rakhmani of all
four Torinsk cluster worlds convene in the Syndicrovi,
the overall regional council (not government) that
ties the them all together, and handles cultural and
economic issues of mutual importance.
<P>
<b>Syndari:</b> Xenough's military (officer) caste. There are
two reasons why the Syndari have such a priveleged
position. First a history of bloody confrontations
between the Syndicrate and other Avalar planetary
governments requires a fierce fighting force to
protect the resources and assets of the Kopol on
Xenough and the rest of the Torinsk cluster. Secondly
military service allows the Syndicrate to isolate and
rechannel lower caste aggression. Syndaries are
permitted some participation in for profit planetary
enterprises, usually those dealing beyond the Torinsk
cluster.
<P>
The Syndari are the only caste permitted to develop
psionic talents. Any other caste (with the exception
of Rakhmani, who are simply executed) caught with
psionic training are lobotomised without exception.
This monopoly extends from the day and age of conflict
with the Zhodani and the Avalaran secret police known
as the Shanza.
<P>
<b>Noutardi:</b> Middle Management/Technical Professional.
Engineers, scientists, doctors, designers, most
"corporate" officers and anyone in a complicated
college level profession are Noutardi.
<P>
<b>Cretemora:</b> Technical/Non-Technical Professional:
Includes most service workers in retail, medical and
low level technical jobs.
<P>
<b>Esouli:</b> Merchant/Artisan. Small-scale merchants,
bankers, accountants and speculators.  Handle most low
level transactions. Xenough's banking system is an
archaic maze of semi-official channels rather than up
front enterprises.  Most money movement among the
masses is handled by the Esouli, who are premitted to
skim off a percentage for their own upkeep.
<P>
<b>Gineeari:</b> Artistic/Entertainer. Originally a subcaste
than a caste. Nevertheless the Gineeari have been
promoted to importance for one reason: they are the
only caste that tolerates extensive offworld contact.
Being of low status they are seen as being of less
susceptibility to offworld pollution. Hence the
Gineeari crew Xenough's merchant marine, act as
go-betweens and interpreters for offworld business
transactions.  They enjoy little of the amenities that
comes with their role, however, and the Syndary and
their security services control their movements and
actions.
<P>
<b>Poilu:</b> The "untouchables" of Xenough. Sanitation, food
preperation, and general labor are handled by these
lowly workers. Unlike Hindu culture no stigma is
accorded for incidental contact between them and the
upper castes. Generally these workers bear up under
their low status with good nature, and their hard work
does bring a measure of security and prosperity. Poilu
make up the bulk of Xenough's military personnel, and
their bravery and valor in battle is rewarded
generously by the upper castes.
<P>
Xenough and its sister worlds are extremely xenophobic
as a result of their shared adversities and fear of
outside poaching of their resources. Some of this fear
is highly justified, but mostly it is an anachronistic
superstition. Nevertheless offworlders are generally
restricted to certain areas, are under constant
supervision by Syndari or Geneeari escorts and
security details, and are prohibited from making
direct contact to any other caste member except
through the auspicies of their escorts. Offworld
visitors are also required to have a brightly colored
dye applied to parts of their faces and the palms of
their hands, and carry a registration marking
temporarily tattooed to their right cheek.  That is
not to say that offworlders are completely seperated
from local culture; but it takes years of constant
contact and careful diplomacy to convince the local
leadership of one's lack of threat, and even then a
person is still barred from direct contact with the
general population.
<P>
The other thing that impresses a visitor is Xenoughs
love of precision.  The narrow margins of life and
comfort requires organisation and efficiency to an
extreme degree. A cadence, a rhythm exists to every
part of life on the world, one that requires lifelong
attention to fully learn (which may partially explain
the xenophobia). That is not to say that life runs on
a hurried schedule. Rather the outpouring of excessive
or unnecessary effort is frowned upon. Every endeavor
has a duration sufficient for success. If success does
not occur, it could be for a number of reasons.  If
the path is futile, than no more effort will be spent.
Wastage of lives, money and energy on a worthless path
is better spent everywhere. This makes Xenough society
much more progressive (but not liberal) than the
Avalaran mainstream, as the local leadership places
more merit on the lives of their lower castes. It also
makes interactions, and language and culture insistent
and concise, and obsessive about the tangible.
Speculative conversation is not a popular art, though
poetry and literary composition are strong.
<P>

<h3>History</h3> Xenough is one of a handful of systems in the
middle of Foreven settled before the Imperial Era. The
world was settled around -1235 by ROM colonists that
crossed the Great Rift with the intent of settling in
the Spinward Marches. A conflict among the upper
leadership led to a fission of the group into as many
as five different factions, and they scattered in
different directions. Two of these groups penetrated
into Foreven, and settled the worlds of Xenough and
Tepenke.
<P>
The Xenough group actually had no intention of
settling on such an unlivable world, but a catastophic
drive failure coupled with increasingly mutinous
elements forced the choice.  Lingering resentment
among the group was handled ruthlessly: rebels were
marooned in the desert without water. Continuing
conflicts and purges turned the early colony into a
weak police-state. Continuing shortages of vital
resources, especially water required that every member
of society be a productive contributor. The joint
needs of security and productivity led to the creation
of the Kopol system early on, though it largely
developed in fits and starts than as a workable system
from the beginning.
<P>
Xenough's water needs were met with the redirection of
kuiper and cometary ice towards the inner system.
These operations were carried out with primitive TL
7-8 spacecraft, who often travelled over the period of
years to reach their objectives. The sacrifice of
their crews in time, and often, their lives was
heavily impressed upon the populace. Stoicism and
tenacity were stressed, as were conformity and a
growing disdain for the outer universe.  The struggle
to live on such a hostile world narrowed local
perspectives, till only resentment of their weaker
forebears remained.
<P>
Contact came with the Zhodani in -710, and with the
Darrians in -117. Neither group impressed the locals,
whose isolation was making them increasingly
distrustful of outsiders. And the cultures of both
races seemed effete and soft, particularly the
Darrians.  The growing presence of the Zhodani was a
cause for alarm, and a brief series of conflicts with
scouting parties occured in the early part of the
Imperial period. First contact with Imperial traders
came in 236, and from them they obtained new jump
drives.  By 260 Xenough was making its own starships,
and was increasingly challenging Zhodani forces for
control of the sector.
<P>
Increasing population and dwindling resources soon
drove economic expansion into neighboring worlds.
Torinsk was first exploited by Xenoughian seekers in
289, and settled permanently in 340. Mahir was first
claimed in 302, and settled in 345.  Forays into
neighboring Titan and Mowbrey subsectors were repulsed
by Zhodani naval squadrons, but they fatally affected
the Consulates plans for further expansion into
Foreven. Weary of continous skirmishing with Xenough,
and more concerned about the Third Imperiums growing
presence in the Spinward Marches, and have more
productive alternatives, the Zhodani eventually
abandoned futher expansion into Foreven after 450. The
Chodlot enclave in Harem and Piah would be maintained
for commercial and diplomatic contact, but the focus
would shift to containment of hostile foreign powers,
including Xenough.
<P>
This policy of containment limited Xenough from
expanding any further, and the Syndicrate softened its
attitude towards offworld contact just enough to
prevent further hostilities with the Zhodani.  By this
time other groups were beginning to contact and settle
Foreven, the most significant of these being the
Kamrathi and the Avalar.  Despite some deep cultural
differences, the Kopol got along with the Kamrathi
rather well. The Kamrathi government was still rather
socialistic in its early days, and it was more
interested in trade rather than imperialistic
expansion.  And its alliance with the Akras minor
race, which had amiable ties with the Kopol as well,
reassured the battle scarred Syndiacrate that no
trailing threat existed.
<P>
The Avalars were a different matter. Their pragmatic
socialistic government appalled the orderly Kopol, as
did the arrogant attitude of the Venues.  The Avalars
made it clear that they coveted the rich resources of
the Torinsk cluster, which aggravated local
xenophobia. The military ties with the Zhodani didn't
help either. The Syndari and the Avalar military
locked horns in the upper reaches of Piah subsector
almost from the beginning, and skirmishes raged in
Wepwaci and Hinantanpyl until the Consulate secured
the two systerms by the 750s.  After that diplomacy
cooled tensions for a while, as the Avalars were more
concerned with securing their new Python subsector
possessions against the Corellian League.
<P>
The conflict over Hepring, however, brought the two
states to several full scale wars (Xenough Wars:
725-729, 750-756, 788-790). These wars were typified
by commerce raiding and quick strikes, as both sides
lacked the heavy capital ships needed for a
traditional fight.  The Consulate won all three wars,
but failed to accomplish a decisive victory in any of
them, and the last war was a pyrrhic victory. It
became increasingly clear that the Avalars would win
eventually, and with the Zhodani mediating, the
Torinsk cluster agreed to join the Avalar Consulate in
795.
<P>
Accession did not bring peace to the region. During
the 800s a long trade war broke out between the
Syndari forces on Hepring and commercial groups on
Titan, and these wars escalated into low level
skirmishing with the Titan Planetary Navy.  Relations
with the Avalar government have been strained at best,
but secession has been made unattainable by the
strengthening Consulate military.
<P>
For most of the 1000s Xenough concentrated upon
commercial independence, and the world has become the
largest manufactory in the Consulate. Heavy industry
is mostly concentrated upon the other Torinsk cluster
worlds, while the most sophisticated manufacture and
R&D are carried out on Xenough itself. Regency
immigration has not been permitted, but commercial
contact has been quite extensive, and Xenough exports
heavily to the Regency interface. High-tech
manufacturing has come to entirely dominate the local
economy, and Xenough is looking to expand into the
markets of the Darrian Confederacy and independent
client worlds.
<P>
Relations with the Avalar government have not
improved. The forceful annexation of Kamrathi in the
1090s undermined what progress had been made by the
Consulate in integrating the cluster, and Xenough has
intensified its ties with Kamrathi secessionists, and
independent worlds like Reidain (2925) and Syl(2724)
to trailing.  The break with the Zhodani had little
impact in improving relations.
<P>
