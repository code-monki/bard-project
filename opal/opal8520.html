Redi was the site of a major Ancient base prior to the
Final War. It was destroyed  by a powerful weapon that
struck the world's northern hemisphere . The force of
the blast caused most of the northern crust to
literally peel off, leaving the world looking
noticeably asymmetrical, with one hemisphere smaller
than the other. Because of the obvious nature of the
damage, the local Ancient site was publicly
acknowledged by the Third Imperium. Most of the
Ancient base was vaporised by the attack, but several
secondary sites (read: garbage disposal areas) had
been found by Imperial era archaeologists.
<P>
The devastation of the attack has left the world with
little commercial or economic value. Nonetheless the
world attracted attention. A group of Vilani
traditionalists, desiring to leave modern society
behind, colonised the world around 250, subsisting
upon subsistence farming and fishing. Unscrupulous
corporate interests on Pretoria and Urnas had taken
advantage of the low local tech level, engaging in
uncontrolled chemical dumping that polluted much of
the local wilderness and water. Because of the
perceived worthlessness of the Ancient site, the local
government was named its caretaker by the IISS,
relieving it of an unnecessary funding drain.
<P>
The low tech level was no match for Vargr invaders
that took the world in 1121, and the Sourrirrakhs
corsairs have ruled the world without major challenge
from its rivals or the Regency government ever since.
The Sourrirrakhs are oppurtunists that see Redi has a
temporary staging ground for their eventual return to
the Vargr Wilds. Most of the Vargr on the world are
dependents of their ship crews and affiliated
auxiliaries shielded by the protective blanket of the
Regency. The Regency government considers the group
parasitic and unproductive, and prefers that they move
elsewhere. But the stated goal of the corsairs puts
them in conflict with the RQS and other groups that
seek to deter a renaissance of corsair power in the
Wilds, and the Regency must satisfy itself with the
status quo.
<P>
The local Ancient site had been cleaned out by the
Scout Service during the antebellum period, and had
been turned over to the local government in 1083. The
Vargr rulers closed the site after the world was
declared Fait Accompli, and brought in their own
scientists to examine it for useful technology. RISS
and the Regents Office have assured the subsector
community of the harmlessness of the site;
nevertheless it has been a sore issue with several
neighboring planetary governments.
