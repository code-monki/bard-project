Caraz is a massive, hollowed out asteroid, inhabited
by Solomani descended from an ancient sublight
colonisation mission. The internal environment of the
asteroid is entirely self-contained, including several
man-made lakes and "oceans" that provide water and
humidity. Every twenty years or so, however, the world
enters a dense cloud of cometary and asteroidal
debris, which nearly blankets the world and cuts it
off from external contact for seven or eight years.
During these times, Caraz is red zoned, though
stations exist insystem that transmit and recieve
X-Web information to and from the world during the
"shadow" season.


<P>
This predominantly Solomani colony was hollowed out of
a large planetoid during the Long Night.  The local
system is quite young, and meteoric debris is present
in large amounts, and collisions and bombardment
forced the construction of subterranean habitats. The
current colony was constructed with Imperial aid in
the 1070s, and consists of a large spherical cavity
nearly 200 kms in diameter, that has been
progressively excavated for decades.  Most of the
population lives in the shell, leaving the inner
surface reserved for farms and water courses. Several
mirrors built down shafts leading from the surface
reflect sunlight into the core.  Because of its
periodic isolation, the population has become rather
content with its lot, though there is a major outflow
of its young during those years it emerges from the
dust clouds surrounding its primary. Several lengthy
holidays commemorate important local events, and a
carnival lasting upwards of a month are thrown just
prior and after "occultation."  The next emergence of
Caraz will occur in 1204.
