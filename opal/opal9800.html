   <P>


The <I>Saint Simeon</I> was a Solomani colony ship that was
stranded over this barren world in -278.  The ship, a
25,000 ton colony transport, suffered this fate when
one of its boats crashed into its engineering section
while attempting to dock at too high of a closing
velocity. The collision crippled the ships engineering
section beyond repair.

 <P>
A jump courier attached to the ship was sent out to
search for help, and the colonists were cycled down to
the world's surface into temporary shelters to wait
for its return.  They were still waiting when scouts
from the Third Imperium contacted the world in 64.

 <P>
By that time the colonists had resigned themselves to
their fate, and had begun to expand the colony by
subterranean tunneling.  Sam's World has never
advanced far from a tech level of 8, due in large part
to a shortage of heavy metals and natural organics in
the system.  All of the locals resources were
channeled into food production; air, water and waste
recycling and having to survive alone on a desolate
and hostile world.  In this the Sams (as they call
themselves) took immeasurable pride in their toughness
and self-reliance.
 <P>

When the IISS contacted them they refused the offers
of more advanced Imperial technology that could only
be maintained or replaced by offworld imports.  They
did accept assistance in building technical databases,
and were grateful for new information on construction,
life support and life science advancements.  But for
the most part they rebuffed both the scouts and the
Third Imperium, and showed little interest in being
engaged outside of their tough but apparently
rewarding lives.

 <P>
The trade encouraged by the j-1 route into the
Marrekesh Trade League brought some additional income
and luxury to the world, but the locals never got
beyond building a primitive starport.  Nor is their
hospitality industry worth writing home about.

 <P>
The world's government is divided among several
"Sections" organised into technical specialization.
The name and structure suggests that they are
descended from the <I>Saint Simeon</I>'s crew and section
structure. All education above the middle school level
is controlled by the Sections, and all inhabitants of
the world pass through one of their technical high
schools before they can obtain any kind of employment
at their majority. Graduates go on to lengthy seven
year apprenticeships learning the skills and
experience within their chosen career.
 <P>

This educational structure tends to stifle creative
thought and does not reward individuality, as those
are seen as unnecessary luxuries. It is also the
reason for the world's lack of technical advancement.
The Sams were so staunch in their conformity that
adolescents showing no desire to fit in were exiled,
often scooped up by the local police and dumped on a
passing trade ship. Free thinking and expression, even
artistic expression and exploration, were considered
counterproductive and tawdry. Even poetry was held in
popular contempt.

 <P>
Indeed the world's populace is conservative to a
degree unimaginable even among staunch Vilani cultural
conservatives. Fashions, social habits, decorations,
architecture... the whole fabric of cultural exchange
and expression is fossilised into frozen patterns.  It
is as if the Sams were still waiting for that lost
jump courier, still attending to interim survival
until it returned, allowing them to vanquish the
universe on the strength their own merits rather than
embrace anything from the outside world.

 <P>
Even the systems government and populace is beginning
to tire of their conformity, and the Regency has
established a RISS base to assist them in upgrading
their educational and industrial systems, and smooth
the transition to full outside contact.
