Timmer is tidally locked. The perpetual sunlight of
the hotside forces the population to live in colonies
along or near the terminator. Most of the population
is engaged in farming, using large mirrors to redirect
sunlight into their fields. Most of the worlds water
is locked into an ice cap at the Darkside equator, and
the melted runoff is physically transported by
insulated pipeline to irrigate the fields. The unusual
circadian rhythm imposed by the local environment have
caused the locals to adapt to a longer cycle, with a
day lasting up to 48 hours easily.
<P>
The local scout base is located at the south pole, far
from most communities. Operations here have always
been shrouded in secrecy, a practice that continues to
this day. It is rumored that S-3, the Scout Security
Service, maintained its primary Deneb facilities here,
but that remains unsubstantiated. All civilian
transport is prohibited for a 50 mile radius around
the base, and trespassers are usually detained and
interrogated for long periods of time. Most of the
facility appears to be built underground, and local
gossip usually centers on the goings on there.
