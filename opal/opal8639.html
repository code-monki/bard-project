Pretoria was originally settled during the first
century of the Third Imperium's expansion. As with so
many other worlds in the coreward and spinward corner
of the sector, the first colonists were predominantly
Vilani. Later colonisation waves of Solomani
and mixed blood humans eventually assimilated into
these communities, and the racial distinction faded
away on most worlds. But on Pretoria the Vilani were
able to preserve their cultural heritage almost
intact, as their urban communities were tightly
organised around small neighborhood sized collectives
known as Meshdigarli. This led to some tension with
immigrating Solomani, but in many cases these
latecomers were less well organised than the Vilani,
and were easily assimilated into the tightknit
communities. This same communal loyalty created
problems when a noble family of pureblooded Solomani
descent, known as the Carles-Davies took over the
world after the Alkhalikoi ascension. It was to have
disastrous consequences, culminating in the infamous
Rachelean Revolts.
<P>
Because of this conflict, traditional education and
authority had to go underground. Educators formed
secret shadow academies where students were taught the
Vilani language and culture, in small dormitories and
cloistered classrooms. Attempts to ferret out these
"school-rings" with random searches and expedient mass
arrests further radicalised the population, and many
school-rings became training grounds for terrorists
and resistance cells. These rings carefully preserved
the world's Vilani culture and language, and
eventually took the lead for planetary recovery and
communal reconciliation after the Carles-Davies were
exiled and martial law imposed.
<P>
Grief and shame over the actions of Zidi Rachele and
his terrorists led to self-imposed isolation, and the
world became known as the "Tomb of Deneb" to its
occupying troops for the reticence and silent
suffering of the population. The world, already badly
damaged by the Carles-Davies repression, stagnated
economically to the point that other Vilani began to
shun it and its inhabitants. It was only with the
beginning of the Imperial Civil War, and subsequent
Hard Times that Pretoria finally shook off its tragic
past. It was the main base for naval units protecting
the coreward frontier against Vargr raiders and
invaders, and local defense cadres distinguished
themselves in pitched battles. This patriotic
renaissance was severely tried by the Collapse, but
the sacrifices of its populace in accomodating
billions of Human and Vargr refugees placed the world
back into the mainstream, and the Meshdigarli began
assuming more and more official power and authority.
Pretoria was one of the first worlds granted Home Rule
after the onset of the Representational Reforms.
<P>
The massive population boom that followed the
Collapse, and the aftermath of centuries of occupation
severely altered the world's traditional geography. It
has no single dominating urban center, and the major
cities sprawl over thousands of square kilometers.
Wilderness and urban development create a checkerboard
pattern discernible from the air or orbit, and the
lights of civilisation can be found in nearly every
corner of the globe. Most of the world suffers from
long, snowy winters, and most of the population
resides indoors in apartment-like structures of linked
residences, schools and shops. Depending upon the size
and organisation of its population, many of these
structures are either autonomous governments, or link
themselves together into virtual states.  This
semi-anarchic structure is a direct result of police
terror, and tax revenues and governmental authority is
split between recognised Collective member-states.
<P>
Economically the world is closely tied to supporting
the Quarantine and its forces. Most of the new
economic development since the Collapse has been
funded indirectly by heavy military investment in
local infrastructure and defense facilities. The local
naval base is just shy of being a Depot in its own
right, and has extensive orbital and lunar facilities
scattered around the system. The 194th Fleet itself is
based at a huge orbital arcology that dwarfs every
other orbital facility in the system. Pretoria's local
industry is not dominated by the large military
"Plant#s" that are found in other high tech systems,
as the world's proximity to the Frontier deemed it too
vulnerable.
<P>
Pretoria's local culture is rather odd too. Academics
are very heavily stressed in local society, though
free compulsory education is unobtainable locally, and
a students progress is based upon their ability to
obtain scholarships and community sponsorship based
upon their academic accomplishments. Top academics and
scientists living in quarters and conditions that
separate and insulate them from local politics and the
common man. In contrast to this basically powerless
elite, secret societies are actually in control of
most local politics. While the Meshdigarli keep things
running smoothly, these societies duke it out for
dominance and political favors in backroom manuevering
and often violent intrigue. While the existence of
these groups are directly traceable to terrorist rings
during the Carles-Davies' reign, the locals justify
their existence as a democratic application of the
ancient Vilani Shadow Emperor. The fear of these
politics, and residue of the past, (and the cold
climate) compels the citizenry to cover themselves in
heavy, concealing clothing to prevent easy individual
recognition.
