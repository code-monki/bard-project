Aufusyah is the site of the Salika Reservation. In 1110, their sublight generational starship stopped in the Ahfatre system
to affect repairs to their fusion plant. First contact was made by a mixed Aslan and Human crew aboard an Aslan
merchant vessel. They were able to determine that fixing the fusion plant was cost-prohibitive. In return for allegiance and
scrapping the Salika starship (the Salika were allowed to keep whatever equipment they needed for their survival), the
Aslan Heirate transported the Salika to Aufusyah so that they could build
themselves a new home. The Salika have been exceptionally grateful to the Aslan for their assistance. Two later vessels
were settled here as well. The reservation now holds over three quarters of a million Salika.
Note: See <cite>Traveller's Digest</cite> #19 for background on the Salika.
