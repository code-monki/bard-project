Fennec is an agricultural world dominated by a
government that is also an economic monopoly. Fennec
was first settled during the late 100s by colonists
that were newly ennobled by the Imperial government as
an incentive in moving to the frontier. Earlier
settlement had not been possible because of the lack
of economic resources in overcoming the blistering
local climate and pernicious plant life that ruined
imported agriculture. The difficulties of living on
this world required that each noble and their estate
was a self-contained entity independent of outside
support. Each noble had his own police, banks,
starport (usually just a landing pad), factories,
farms and energy production facilities.
<P>
Despite the careful degree of control over the common
people built into this arrangement, the nobles were
able to deliver enough prosperity over the past
thousand years to prevent major opposition from
developing. Fennec became what is termed a "soft"
police state where the population was made dependent
upon their employment and standing within local
communities, and therefore stood against any sort of
innovation or dissension that might undermine their
comfortable lives. Consensus was backed up by
effective estate security and police backed up by
legions of paid informers that provide instant
notification of trouble. But for the most part the
nobles were content to leave their people alone aside
from this, and were consumed with either the local
social scene or interestate politics in an effort to
outdo each other. Some offworld megacorps attempted to
exploit the situation to their advantage, but were
less than skilled at playing the local political
games.
<P>
But dissension still existed in the background of
Fennec society, and it found an unlikely ally in the
Vargr refugees and raiders of the late Civil War and
early Collapse period. The new immigrants were mostly
squatters or established on Regency owned territory
around the downport or the scout base. They were
therefore outside of the local established economic
order, and in many cases either had their own
businesses and offworld connections, or were full
blown members of the Pack. This threatened the local
monopolies, and has galvanised citizens fed up being
property of an anachronistic feudal system. Attempts
to organise a Represenative Referendum has been
quelled with illegal action by police, and the noble's
soft system has slowly been replaced with a hard
system of coercion and punitive laws. Violence is
growing in some parts of the world, and the Regency is
keeping a close eye on the situation
