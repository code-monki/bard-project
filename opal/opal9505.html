<P>
Ralhe was colonised during the halcyon days of the
first Imperial expansion into District 267 in the
300s. A lack of resources, a tendency towards piracy
and the contentious relations between seperated
communities made it a backwater.  Only the J-1 traffic
coming down the Spin Main kept the colony from being
abandoned or downgraded.
<P>
The economic slowdown created by the Psionic
Supressions impacted this trade, and impoverished the
locals. The habit of piracy and smuggling became
imperative ways of life, of survival on a world so
desolate.  Many pirate bands eventually became
anti-Imperial, and contracted out to the Zhodani, or
at least oppurtunistically exploited military
confrontations between the two powers.  Raids from the
world escalated during the Third Frontier War, and the
Imperium retaliated with a full invasion of the world
in 983. The raiders were hunted down, their bases
destroyed, and world was placed under the control of
neighboring Iderati.
<P>
Now under colonial control, the world's poverty
remained unabated, and was reinforced by Iderati's
benign neglect.  The controlling world set aside few
resources for upgrading or improving the lot of its
new subjects. The "colonial governor" was little more
than a mid- level appointee of no political standing
or power. And yet Iderati assumed an air of absolute
authority in its dealings with the locals,  This
caused quiet resentment among many locals, though few
outward signs of anger were manifested.  But it boiled
over, suprising Ralhe's masters, after the
announcement of the Representational Reforms.
<P>
Many communities away from the starport and the
capital fermented an independence movement, and
seceded from the Ideratian loyalists.  Fearful of
retaliation from the colonial government, the
secessionists applied and were approved for Regency
membership in 1156. Iderati had been careful to keep
the colony outside of Imperial borders to disquise its
misrule, and was appalled at the idea of losing the
areas it still controlled to further secession.
<P>
The world is at a brittle impasse. Most of its
independent communities bicker among themselves,
having failed to create a unified front against their
former occupiers. Meanwhile those areas under
Iderati's control are heavily patrolled by the Iderati
World Army, whose heavy-handed patrols amount to a
virtual blockade of the outback. A low-level guerilla
war is beginning to emerge, as well as growing
backsliding into piracy and gunrunning. The Regency is
taking a wait-and-see approach in lieu of a lack of
current policy towards the world.
<P>
Ralhes factions are divided as follows:
<P>
Iderati Control Zone (Pop: 320,000): Iderati's main
power center. Includes the old capitol city and the
starport. The ICZ comprises 40 percent of population
but only 20 percent of the land territory. The Iderati
Army controls all main points of entry, and searches
every person, container and vehicle entering the zone.
The Iderati Navy maintains a base here for the SDBs
that monitor in-system traffic.  Most of the ICZs
population is fervently loyal to Iderati, mostly out
of pragmatism rather than genuine affection. These
people believe that Ralhe best chance is Iderati
development money and organisation.  This attitude
does not endear them to outbackers, and some of the
worst fighting is between the free militias and
"turncoat" police and military units.
<P>
Huffington (Pop: 155,000): Second largest community,
and the main pole of resistance on the planet. Not so
much of a unified country as a confederation of local
chiefs and disparate population elements. Plagued by
infighting between rival leaders, which threatens to
escalate the world's anarchy.
<P>
Golan (Pop: 120,000): True power behind the
independents. Founded by Ralhe's small business
community, and bolstered by remnants of the original
colonial police and militia. Golan is trying, only
with partial success, to wedge itself between Iderati
and the other rebellious factions, triangulating a
settlement. Golan recognises that Iderati is the only
hope of bringing development to the world, but without
its colonial domination. It is also working against
the bloody infighting of the FreeLeague and Huffington
in hopes of becoming the world's government, and
restoring order.  Its past attempts at a peace
settlement have been rebuffed, and the world is now
accumulating a covert stockpile of arms and hiring
mercs with the intention of dominating the world by
force of arms. It has recieved quiet encouragement and
support from the Regency to do so.
<P>
Free League (Pop: 100,000): "Bandit" kingdom of
pirates, mercs and guttertrash. Has resurrected the
old practice of piracy in order to survive. Leadership
disinterested in taking sides in the fight with
Iderati, and has attacked both sides' shipping.
