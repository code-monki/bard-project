Pylkah is a small, desert world in the middle of the
Urnian Main.  A world of few outstanding resources, it
was ignored for the most part by the Rule of Man era
colonists that settled the rest of the subsector.
Only the early governments of <a href="opal9309.html">Urnian</A> retained any
interest, using its neighbor as a test range for its
extensive munition industries, and as a secondary
trade center. A few traders also settled the world due
to its strategic location.
<P>
Pylkah was settled early in the 200s by Imperial
culture immigrants. Because of its challenging
environment, the world would have sorely tested the
efforts of well-organised and ably led colonists.  But
the first settlers on Pylkah were a divisive group to
begin with, and the hardships eventually drove them
apart.
<P>
Eventually the different groups founded nation-states
around the shores of the world's two small oceans.
These states fought over water, mining rights, trade
access, and Imperial influence. Three major powers,
the countries of Pyllos, Nordicia and Amarutios, came
to dominate the world, eventually amassing sizeable
nuclear arsenals.  Urnian and its arms merchants were
only too happy to provide these warring powers with
the armaments to protract their struggles, and its
agents acted as provocateurs, stirring up conflict and
keeping the market humming with demand.
<P>
In the latter days of the Antebellum period, the
Imperium tried to improve relations and extend its
influence on the world helped Pyllos construct a large
C class starport.  This influence was not tolerated by
either Pyllos neighbors, or by their Zhodani patrons.
The Imperial megacorp SUSAG further complicated the
situation with the presence of its psi-drug plants,
and its mercenary willingness to deal with all the
factions present for both survival and profit.
<P>
Shortly before the Imperial Civil War began, Pyllos
and its neighbors were dragged into a world war,
instigated in part by the clumsy dealings of SUSAG,
which saw much fighting that left no clear winner or
any country with a decisive advantage.  The war
dragged off and on until the Collapse, slowed down by
the mutually agreed withdrawal of DoD and Zhodani
material and diplomatic assistance to their clients.
<P>
The Collapse reescalated the war to high-intensity
levels, but it became clear to all warring parties
that war was no longer a viable or productive option,
and that the new Regency would soon move to end the
fighting. By mutual aggreement in 1132, the warring
factions agreed to unify the world under a single set
of governing protocols, and allow the Regency to take
over external defense and diplomatic duties.  But
before the Regency could take over, the individual
nations committed themselves to finishing the war, and
thereby eliminating past grievances that would
hamstring the world in the future if left unresolved.
<P>
A strange positional warfare soon developed, where
small combat units of lightly equipped airmobile and
armor troops danced across the world's deserts in a
giant chess game.  They would attempt, through
outflanking, rapid advances and night marches, to get
a decisive tactical advantage over their enemies.
These battles were mostly bloodless, with the nation
at a severe tactical disadvantage forfeiting the
territory without much of a fight.  Where opposing
units failed to get an advantage, fabian strategies of
raiding and skirmishing took over.  The territory won
in these battles were either absorbed into the winners
territory, or were bartered back to its original owner
in exchange for other desired objectives.  Through the
diplomatic and military networking these battles
entailed, the groundwork for the world's current
technocratic government were established, while behind
the scenes a commission under Regency supervision
rationalised, chartered and ratified the new
government.
<P>
Pylkah is a true feudal technocracy in that it has no
real central government beyond this network of
protocols and good faith agreements. The overriding
authority on the planet is the Regency appointed
governor-general, who has command over a unified world
military, centralised financial and judicial
institutions, and oversees the running of the worlds
starports, transport and utilities.  Below the GG is a
loose network of former national governments and their
fluctuating areas and geographical regions of control.
The overlap between these agencies has been paramount
in maintaining the world's unity, as integration of
the population has been slow and hampered by
controversy and ethnic tensions.
