Khishuda was a whistlestop world for starships making
the turn off of the Midway towards Usani and the Reft
trade route. The world is hot and metal poor, and was
deemed not worthy of further development by the
Imperial government. Aside from starport personnel,
only a small community of a few individuals, usually
transients, was ever established. After the Collapse,
the world should have been completely depopulated, but
the community refused evacuation. Today only a single
survivor, known only as "Blue Tom", is left alive to
keep the starport operational. Blue Tom is in his
seventies, but remains hale, and tirelessly maintains
the port despite his age and the elements. The local
free traders are strongly supportive of him, for
reasons of both self interest and a genuine liking for
the old man. Recently Regency government emissaries
have begun negotiating with the old man for ownership
of the port; reports indicate that he has resisted
sale offers, and would prefer that he be left alone.
