Epepazap gets its name from a curious form of
onomatopeia.  The world is home to an excessive amount
of electrical phenomenon, and the sound suggests the
most common expression of this activity.  For Epepazap
is also known as the "plasma capitol of Charted
Space."
<P>
Naturally generated plasmas first entered the Solomani
conciousness around -2525, back on old Terra. About a
century before the invention of jump drive, observers
were shocked by the manifestation of previously
unknown (or at least poorly documented) plasmas with
unusual effects upon ground and aerial objects. The
most common manifestation of this was the unusual
"ball lightning", but also included so called "ghost
lights", "night chasers", "foo fighters" and the
mysterious crop circle phenomenon.
<P>
All of these phenomenon are in evidence on Epepazap to
a much greater degree. For the world has highly
turbulent weather, large expanses of rolling hills
covered in grassland and forest, and most of the dry
land is fractured volcanic rock that lends itself to
formation of these plasmas. These plasmas are in of
themselves no mystery. They are formed within regions
of turbulent air flow, either within a storm cell or
columns of rising air, in conjunction with ordinary
lightning or static differentials created by humidity.
<P>

Ghost Lights, also known as vortrons, are created by
ground lightning strikes in fractured rock. Gas
trapped within these faults and fractures become
highly charged, and are often released due to
geological activity. Ball Lightning is created within
the highly turbulent trailing section of large storm
cells; these can be particularly discomfiting as the
plasmas are capable of passing through otherwise solid
matter (plasmas lack electrons, and conduct the
electrons of other matter rather well, which allows
them to "squeeze" through metals, wooden walls..etc.).
<P>
Night Chasers are cold temperature plasmas created by
downdrafts in otherwise dry conditions.  These were
among the first plasmas created in a laboratory (on
Terra by Nikolai Tesla way in the early 1900s) and
were instrumental in understanding the phenomenon.
Chasers are easily disturbed by air turbulence, and
will "chase" after a moving object, such as an
automobile or small aircraft. Foo fighters, so
infamous during Terra's Second World War, are a
variant of Chasers, and are the result of massive air
turbulence created by mass concentrations of propellor
driven aircraft.
<P>
But Epepazap is most famous for its namesake, the
Sparkler, which is responsible for crop circles.
Sparklers are created by turbulence: rapidly shifting
wind columns over rolling hills and marginal forests
will create tornadic columns that create highly
energetic plasmas. Sparklers are unstable, as they
embody the chaos of their formation, and will
eventually discharge their energy into the ground.
Row crops are most amenable to this kind of energy
discharge, due to their point charge density.  A
sparkler will drop over a field, and discharge, in a
rotational pattern, its energy as microwave energy.
This softens plant tissues, permitting the crop to be
laid down without splintering. Because of its internal
turbulence, a sparkler will create intricate patterns
commensurate with its formation, even Mandlebrot sets.
<P>
Epepazap was originally settled to take advantage of
its massive plasma generation ability. Natural plasmas
are highly useful for manufacturing, medicine and data
storage. The world is dotted with arrays of windmills,
charge-wheels and "groves" of metal rods designed to
collect this energy for various industrail processes.
Over time, communities of artists, developers,
religious mystics and some outright nuts were
attracted to the world to exploit it for their own
purposes and gain.
<P>
Most of these communities have very little in common
other than the plasma, and Epepazap has gyrated
between weak technocratic rule and outright
balkanisation. The last technocracy collapsed in 1150
and the world is once again balkanised.  Fortunately
enough goodwill exists between the various social
strata that conflict is rare, and quickly passes. The
main factions on the world are a mixture of
traditional Consulate and new-age Regency industrial
and development groups, clustered near the world's two
main downports. The remainder of the planet is
controlled by broad agro collectives, artist
communities and vagabond wanderers, most with plasma
generating and collecting gear of one kind or another.
<P>
Epepazap is also famous for its Infirmirary Plant.
This is a tall grass-like plant with remarkable
sanitary properties. The plants livings tissues
contain a living pulp that can be applied to wounds
and sores, and keep them absolutely free of infection
or sepsis, while accelerating the healing process by
nearly seventy percent.  The actual agents responsible
for this ability has not been synthesised, nor
reproduced through genetic transfer, and the world is
the only source for this plant.  Some biologists
speculate that the heightened presence of plasma
created ions are primarily responsible.
