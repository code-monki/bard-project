   The belt is the  former capital of the Sarid/Oriflamme  subsector. Its 69 million
Inhabitants spread among 100`s of habitat or various size . The system`s four
gas giant and their moons  where also used as homes. The disperse nature of the population has made it hard to recover much from this system . While the former
tech level was not has high as <a href="opal2080.html">L`steich</A>, TL-13 goods are still quite attractive .
<P>
 In a venture similar to that of Oriflamme on L`steich the Balduri government
has built  a small settlement in one of the old habitats in order to have a permenant
salvage base and to service ships heading to its colony on Poysen via So Skire and  <a href="opal3019.html">Ehart</A>  thus extending the <a href="opal2070.html">Nex</A>  jump-2 trade route by 3 worlds and 7 parsecs.
<P>
 The base currently has a staff of 73 but the habitat   once housed 7500 so there is plenty of room to accommodate new arrivals. The Balduri have brought in a SDB and a fleet of small craft to both defend and explore the system .
