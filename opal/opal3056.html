 Linnert is one of the Coreward systems in Jayna recontacted & re-opened using the Trade Co- prosperity technique by VADM Warner Castle (Pronounced Cas-lay) of the "Jayna Fleet" of Solee after the reclamation of Depot /Ultraneta in 1201. The Charismatic Dictator, Hugh Thingolis saw the immediate advantages of being kept in his position for life, and recognized by a Stellar polity the size of the "Soleean Empire".<P>
Linnert is used as a rest world for the crews & workers Solee-<a href="opal3055.html">Galines</A>-<a href="opal3054.html">Czerniak</A> have at  <a href="opal3052.html">Ultraneta</A> Jump-2 to trailing. Not to mention having them spend their pay here, Linnert's defense force militia has received upgraded weaponry to TL-B, and looks forward to the rebuilding of their shipyard with enthusiasm. As of 001-1202 starport is D-class. Most, if not all of Linnert's inhabitants are employed here, or in the surrounding countryside.
	Linnert is considered a gas Giant moon, the sole satellite of the SGG in the 0 orbit of the system M1 V star.
