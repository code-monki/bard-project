Before the Collapse, Gila (pronounced Hee-Lah) was a
minor client state of the Third Imperium. Its remote
location on the border with the Vargr, and hot,
uninviting climate discouraged offworld investment and
colonisation, and poverty caused balkanisation of the
local population into different warring factions. The
most powerful of these were the Union of Tanqueru, the
Republic of Lisarba, and the Deltrine Sultanate.
Tanqueru formed a close working relationship with Ling
Standard that it hoped would allow it to dominate its
rival powers. With generous support from the company,
Tanqueru waged a campaign of gradually annexing its
weaker neighbors through both military intimidation.
The only deterrence to its ambitions were the nuclear
arsenals of Deltrine and Lisarba, but Ling Standard's
control of the starport hindered their resistance, as
did internal bickering between the allies. Deltrine
finally resorted to importing offworld mercenaries
that aided it in constructing its own space capability
(recounted in <cite>Challenge</cite> #71:</B> Space Race) that aborted
the companies monopoly on interstellar contact. With
Ling Standard now neutralised, the balance of power
frayed, and the various powers drifted towards a world
war in the last few years before the Collapse.
<P>
A general war finally broke out in 1134, and ended in
a narrow Lisarban victory in 1137. The starport was
destroyed by a Deltrine air-raid in 1136, and the
Lisarbans chose not to rebuild it. The world's rulers
have shown cool feelings about approaching the Regency
for assistance, preferring to rule in isolation rather
than serving a polity whose policies might upend their
control of Gila. The other powers have never really
reconciled to Lisarba's rule, and these isolationist
policies have enraged former nations like Deltrine and
the Prairie League. Offworld Vargr interests,
including a number of Pack factions, have contacted
dissident elements in hopes of gaining influence.
