Umiikam's deadly atmosphere has never permitted any
long term settlement. Some Vilani belters first came
here early in the Imperial period, but left after
playing out the local mines. The current community is
a breakaway faction from the libertarian/anarchist
sect on nearby Vanzeti. They have lived on the world
since the Fourth Frontier War, and survive by dint of
their well designed shelters. Ammonia loving bacteria
convert and neutralise any outside gas that leaks into
their settlements into non-lethal byproducts. Food is
raised locally in sealed greenhouses, fertilised by
ammonia nitrates obtained from the air, and waste and
CO<sub>2</sub> from local sewage. The locals are friendly to
offworld traders, but dislike too much intrusion and
require that visitors remain confined to the starport.
