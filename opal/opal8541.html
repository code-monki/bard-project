Zinuun was a poor backwater world in antebellum times.
It was ruled by the hereditary Ugrik family, who held
the title Count Zinuun. The world produced mostly
cheap industrial goods for sale on Giikisu, and was
never accorded much importance. But during the Civil
War, the Ugriks began accepting refugees displaced by
fighting in Antra and Atsah subsectors, and the world
developed a reputation as a safe haven for displaced
persons across the trailing portion of the Domain of
Deneb. Millions of people streamed in during the
Abandonment, and the world began to change. Trade with
Twinian necessitated the construction of a large
metals industry, which soon attracted low tech
manufacturers from other parts of the Regency to
construct factories to take advantage of cheap
materials and labor. While the world is still modest
compared to other more developed regions, it is
advancing rather nicely, and it possesses a strong
educational system and several top rate universities.
The decision to make the world a safeside terminus for
goods coming from the Wilds through Namidshur will
probably fuel an even more lasting economic and social
boom.
