Homeworld of the Giukuli minor race. Contact between
this race and the outside universe was prohibited by
the Third Imperium following their abuse at the hands
of the first ruling family of Vincennes. The Giukuli
are a slow-moving, hexapedal species, quite
inoffensive in nature, that lives in small family
groups on the world's windswept plains. They possess a
certain gland that was discovered to have medicinal
value, and the Humbolts and their retainers began
cruelly extracting the gland for research purposes.
This cruelty led to an Imperial Intervention in 628,
and the eventual exiling of the Humbolts and their
allies.  Despite this action, the Imperium did little
to allay further abusive contact, leaving it to the
new Duke of Vincennes to administer the world as he
saw fit. The Regency corrected this small defect, and
the world was finally placed under full protection in
1133. A pair of scout cruisers with intervention
troops are on permanent station in orbit to maintain
the protectorate.
