Szirp was settled around 40 by Solomani colonists from
the expanding Third Imperium. Strategically located
along the Raweh Track, the planet became a major
stopover point for early trade traffic moving through
the intersection of Foreven, Beyond, Trojan Reach and
the Marches. The Imperial Megacorp Naasirka built a
high quality A class starport in the 380s, and the
world became a major trade hub.
 <P>
During the Civil War, Naasirka withdrew from the
world, and the planet went into a temporary economic
slide. A group of Aslan pirates established a base at
Taltern (Trojan Reach 0103), and their raids caused a
drop off of trade through the port.  When Naasirka's
remaining assets went to the auction block in the 1132
Fire Sale, Barchai Technium purchased the starport.
The company hired a team of starmercs that wiped out
the Aslan pirates, and quickly reestablished safe
passage from the Marrekesh Trade League to the Regency
interface.
 <P>
BT/Leviathan's domination of Szirp is so total that
the world is practically a corporate town.  The
government became a technocracy in 1143, staffed
mostly with former BT/L managers.  The starport is its
main maintenance facility in Menorial subsector, and a
major R&R and relief facility for its crews. As a
result, Szirp's hospitality industry has become famous
for its affordability and good service.  While many
facilities are still preferential towards BT/L's crews
and passengers, many hotels and restaraunts have
branched off to serve independent ship crews,
travellers and tourists.
 <P>
The company is intent upon protecting their investment
and its reputation at all costs. The world navy and
ground security are company hired and employed mercs
notable for their lack of patience with suspected
pirates and smugglers.  Dirtside police are often
accused of overzealousness, and the local courts are
are sometimes given to summary judgements.
Fortunately, local laws and punishments aren't very
draconian. Petty lawbreakers are simply expelled
offworld, and the local law enforcement show good
judgement and sense in distinguishing between
legitimate travellers and riff-raff.
 <P>
The company also subsidises a "free market" for a
number of independent enterprises wishing to market
their wares in the previously untapped markets of the
Reach and the Spinward Hinters. Many companies are
given low rent office and shop space for 180 and 360
day periods, with the stipulation that they give a
share of their profits in the form of taxation at the
end of that period. While this creates a steady
turnover of small firms, it gives many entrepenuers an
oppurtunity of low overhead, and allows BT/L the
luxury of identifying and pursuing promising new
ventures at little cost to themselves.
