Sansterre was the first world colonised from
Amondiage, and the beginning of the diaspora of French
speakers into the rest of the Islands. The world has
virtually no dry land (hence the name "Sansterre",
literally "no land"), for active undersea volcanism
prevents the accumulation of dry land for long
periods. Despite this barrier, the colonists
constructed a base on the worlds moon, and used it to
build floating habitats.  Most of the current
population lives in massive "pontoon" cities that are
advanced, giant descendants of the original
settlements, or in huge mobile submersibles that
anchor themselves temporarily to any stable section of
the sea floor.  Several large orbital habitats also
exist, and house much of the world's industrial base.
<P>
Of all of the ESA colonised worlds, Sansterre has
tried hardest to remain faithful to its progenitor
culture. Which is to say its indestructibly French in
its outlook on culture, and its interest in the
intellect. Despite this loyalty, and the "fossilised"
local French dialect, cultural gaps have been
unavoidable. In antebellum times the world spurned
offworld contact, actively harrased visiting
offworlders and aliens, and tilted power towards a
male-dominated hiearchy that favored militarism. The
local government is the most pluralistic of all the
Islands; but this is largely relative as suffrage was
limited by the government to "rational" individuals
(generally people favored by the military and
bureaucracy), and government institutions are
primitive for a democracy, with no developed parties
and factions beyond feudalistic patronage machines.
<P>
When war erupted in 1106 between Neubayern and
Serendip, Sansterre informally allied with its German
neighbor, allowing them to concentrate on other
enemies without fear of an additional front developing
between them.  This alliance allowed Sansterre to rip
Amondiage's military into shreds, and to shield them
from New Home aggression that was concentrating on
Neubayern. The alliance fell apart in 1119, and a
protracted fight with Neubayern and New Home over St.
Genevieve drained it of irreplaceable military units.
As the war dragged on, popular displeasure was turning
into widespread dissent, and the militarists were
totally discredited by the time the Regency intervened
in 1140.  Sansterre suffered few civilian losses or
infrastructure damage, but the dominance of the
military made its economy inefficient and slow in
adapting to change, and much of the worlds industry
was simply burned up by the emphasis upon the now
futile war effort.
<P>
Sansterre has been transformed since contact with the
Regency. The military and its testosterone culture has
subsided in favor of a more moderate political
structure, though patronage still dominates sexual
equality has leveled the playing field. Contact was
reinitiated with Neubayern in the 1180s, and a de
facto peace treaty has permitted the resumption of
trade with that world, exchanging locally harvested
sea floor metals and edible aquatic life for dry land
foodstuffs. The success of this arrangement prompted
Serendip to initiate the Four-Power Talks in 1195, and
trade has increased between all four worlds since
then. Recently the Sansterre government has negotiated
the purchase of a dozen new 5000 ton TL-12 bulk
transports from Serendip, giving the world a modest
but significant merchant marine for the first time
since the war.
