<TD>X<TD>=<TD>Zhodani Way Station<br>
<TD>Z<TD>=<TD>Zhodani naval bases<p>

A way station, unlike the old Imperial equivalent, is
a base that facilitates fleet communications, by
assisting naval couriers, and doesn't actually have
any repair or basing capabilities for line fleet
units. A Zhodani Depot is the same as the Imperial
Depot.

<B>Massina  Subsector:</B>
<P>
The 1116 population of the sector is 39.6 billion,
primarily concentrated on Stablstiaiql (2501) and
Kloiabr (2602). The 1202 population is estimated to be
around 100.4 billion, and shows where the greatest
effect of the Zhodani Exodus is evident. Nearly all of
this increase has occured on the two high population
worlds in the subsector, and has severely strained
their resources. This is particularly true of
Sablstiaql, whose arcologies have been driven to their
design limits by the unforeseen and unplanned
expansion.
<p>
Massina Subsector is defended by the Zhodani 21st
Fleet from its headquarters at Pliakrdla (2905).  The
21st Fleet was engaged in fighting in Regina and
Jewell Subsectors, and suffered severe losses against
the Imperial 213th Fleet when the Siege of Efate was
lifted. Much of its equipment and manpower were in a
stage of reorganisation just prior to the Exodus, and
the massive outflows of people had caught it at a
vulnerable juncture.
<p>
While Massina had considerable economic capacity of
its own, it was mostly in support of efforts in
neighboring Zdiadlevepra (Ziafrplians P) Subsector.
The two main industrial powerhouses of the subsector
(Stablstiaiql and Kloiabr) are really part of the
industrial and commercial community of Zdiadlevepra
subsector, and it is here they send most of their
exports. Kloiabr was the main power, in spite of being
dominated by Zhebronzebl (2505), and its tax base was
used to fund the subsectors basic services and
military bases.
<p>
Self-sufficiency was never an option, as its proximity
to the Third Imperium made the Consulate reluctant to
place too much investment in a region only to see it
destroyed or captured by its enemies.  So in spite of
its potential, the subsector was fairly sleepy in
comparison to its neighbors in Ziafrplians.  The only
indication that things were not the same here was the
legal requirement of armament on most civilian
shipping. While Imperial raiders rarely (if ever) made
here or in Zdiadlevepra (where the same requirement
was in force) the presence of these weapons might have
acted as a deterrent against such an eventuality. The
requirement was scrapped in the wake of the Collapse,
but many older vessels never had their armaments
removed, and continue to mount them as the walls
crumble down all around the Consulate.
<p>
<B>Iasha (3204)</B> Iasha has become one of the most critical
worlds in all of Charted Space. The system is an
important connecter with nearby Cronor, and a massive
number of refugee transports pass through its
starport. The local port has been jammed to
overflowing, and the local staff and supporting
population are overworked and fatigued. An endless
line of ships circle above the world, waiting to
refuel or attain maintenance. The ports normal
clientele have departed elsewhere, and few of the
refugee ships have sufficient money to buy needed fuel
and services, thereby threatening the port with
bankruptcy. The portmaster has threatened to close the
port, but has been dissuaded by armed refugee ships.
But there are rumors that the 12th Fleet (Cronor) has
been talked into stationing a garrison on the world in
support of its beleagured sister fleet, and that
closure is only a few weeks of months away.
