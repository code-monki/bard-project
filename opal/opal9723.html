Joyeuse is the site of violent seismic activity,
undersea landslides, and massive tsunamis that sweep
almost unhindered across the surface of the world.
Despite this threat, a sizeable colony was established
here from Amondiage in the 400s, and the colonists
quickly adapted to their new homeworld's violent
cycles.  Power devolved from the original democratic
council to a small elite of military and technical
leaders, and then to an autocratic monarchy, led by
the Guignaud family. Industrialisation occured early
in local development, giving rise to a class of highly
skilled professionals that commanded the world's
highly regimented workforce and eventually transformed
into a semi-hereditary managerial class. This social
pyramid was popular with the lower classes, as it
clearly delineated an individuals place, and fairly
distributed amenities throughout the population.
 <P>
The power struggles between the larger Islands worlds
triggered by the distribution of jump drive technology
aroused a xenophobic response, and the local
population vehement campaigns against offworlders can
be distilled down to an elemental fear of losing their
modest place in the universe to intangible forces more
insidious than the normal perils of their own world.
New Colchis and its rapacious dictatorship was
especially feared, and the bulk of its military was
intended to fight against anglophone aggression in the
middle part of the New Islands.
<P>
An added complication to the local cultural landscape
is the existence of a local narcotic called Soma by
the locals.  Harvested from a local shrub, Soma
contains powerful numbing opiates that hinder parts of
the autonomic nervous system.  This can create
powerful side effects in its users like irregular
heart beat and respiratory failure, but it renders
them immune to all but the most intense pain and most
kinds of fear. Under higher dosages normal moral
restraints are dulled, and users can go into berserk
rages or relentless manic activity.  Naturally,
members of the planetary military recieve large doses
for use in combat operations or long campaigns; to
remove fatigue, hunger and fear; and to extend their
endurance and ferocity. RPKF troops fear dealing with
Joyeuseans, whether soldiers or officials, as many of
them are not the normal definition of sane because of
years of Soma abuse.
