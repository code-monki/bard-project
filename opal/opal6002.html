This world is populated solely by Outcasts, a shy and secretive race that
communicate by light emission. After the collapse it found itself
undefended, as the Outcast Empire was very centralised, and no forces were
based there on a permanent basis. It was the rule of a tribal oligarchy,
whose only response to the collapse of civilisation was to
crack down on the populace even harder, a traditional Outcast response.
<P>
After a devastating Vampire attack, the government was overthrown, and the
'Council of Order', a Civil Service Bureaucracy installed. They started a
programme to provide planetary defences for the world, and by 1163 had
built hundred of missile batteries on the world. Diplomatic approaches
from Strom were ignored, and it seemed that Kervid would remain isolated
from the Interstellar community. Two things changed that. Hiver advanced
missions in 1185 made contact with the world, and were accepted. The most
accepted reason for this is the similarities between themselves and the
Hivers, both being races which communicate
non-verbally. The other event was the Hiver revelation that the Outcast
homeworld was rebuilding, with an eye to regaining it's empire. The
decidedly non-traditional bureaucracy were horrified at the prospect of
being subsumed in the traditions they had fought off so successfully, and
assented to joining the Pact. 
<P>
Nowadays some interesting trade items can be
had on Kervid, including some very advanced opto-electronic devices. The
Hiver built a Support Base here, less for supporting Convoys, and more for
Naval sweeps into former Outcast space. Of Pact
politics, Kervid is one of the 'non-aligned' worlds. It has a strong
antipathy to the Leenitakot Droyne, the 'Killers of their kin', but seem
content to throw the occasional diplomatic insult at them. Any ships
approaching Kervid are advised to stick precisely to the approach pattern
given them. The planet is nicknamed the 'porcupine' planet, in honour of
the myriad missile batteries that adorn it. They are not loath to use
them.
