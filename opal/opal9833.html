The reasons for Tobia's settlement have been lost to
antiquity. The world has very unpleasant atmosphere
and hothouse climate, and most of the population lives
in large arcologies at the planets poles. Tobia is
heavily industrialised despite its high O2 content,
and specialises in industries like electronics and
communications.  Many so called "infrastructure" firms
like structural engineering, industrial process
design, construction, and systems engineering are also
found in large concentrations.  Tobia has a highly
skilled labor force, and is one of the Regency's
premier industrial worlds.
<P>
Because of the challenges that Tobia's environment
presents to its population, a regimented society has
grown up to inculate and enforce basic rules of
survival. A "role model" state exists, where
educators, medics, emergency workers and other people
in public authority positions are looked up to as the
governing elite.  Much of Tobia's culture centers
around the exaltation of self-sacrificing communal
service. Where on most worlds the jobs at the pinnacle
of society are basically high ranking bureaucratic
positions in the private or public sectors, becoming a
firefighter or some other scion of public service is
the apogee on Tobia. Employment in these fields is
severely restricted to the same degree that legal and
medical fields are on other worlds.
<P>
Stationed in geostationary orbit is the famous Gordian
Knot Complex, a grouping of several space habitats and
orbital factories. The Knot is home to the largest
concentration of shipyards in the Regency, and
virtually every major shipbuilder has at least one
facility among the many.  About two billion people
live in the Knot, working primarily in export
industries that ship goods to across the Spinward
Extents. Nearby is the Fontana Arcology, the
headquarters and main marshalling point for the
Regency's 128th Fleet, which is responsible for deep
rift patrols into the Islands Subsectors and beyond.
The 128th is supplied exclusively with high jump
warships, which are generally destroyers and cruisers,
and includes few capital ships.
