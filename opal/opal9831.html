Hradus was one of the original 28 worlds chosen for
the Industrial Development Program. This despite the
objections of its government, which preferred the
status quo to possibly loosing its monopoly over the
local economy and culture.  Percieving this
reluctance, a number of economic interests, both
native and offworld, conspired with the planetary
military to overthrow the government in 1141, and a
junta was imposed that embarked on a crash course in
industrial development. In the last 61 years, the
world has enjoyed a six point increase in tech level,
the highest for any world in the IDP, and the best for
a high population world anywhere in the Regency.  But
the methods used to create this advancement has come
at a high human cost. Large sections of the population
were displaced by development, and dissent has not
been tolerated by the regime.  The majority of the
populace had been ambivalent about their lot,
accepting the sacrifice in hopes of enjoying the
fruits of a higher standard of living, but in recent
years this has hardened into passive resistance as
economic growth has slowed, and repressed grievances
come to the surface.
