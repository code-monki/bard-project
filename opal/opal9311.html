Nanno lies at one end of the Urnian Main, on the
interface between Urnian/Foreven and Marrekesh/Beyond.
It's starport is a break-bulk point for j-1 traders
from <a href="opal9308.html">Urnian</A> and <a href="opal9312.html">Pylkah</A>, and a stopover point for J-2
ships coming from Margrave (Beyond 2601) or Nemo
(Beyond 2802).  Most of its population is employed in
one of two industries: either the various companies
that service this traffic, or as caregivers and
faculty in the systems huge boarding schools.
<P>
In the latter capacity, Nanno is also known as
"Nanny." The world was settled as a strongpoint
against the subsector's pirates in 436, and was
supported with aid, and heavily patrolled by
starmercs, from the nearby Marrekesh Trade League. The
safety and security of the port and the surrounding
community made it a popular port for trader crews, who
could ensconce their families under the watchful eyes
of the local garrison and not have to worry about the
possibility of pirate raids or hostage-taking upon
their dependents. This home basing created a need for
additional services, particularly health care and
education, and through generous grants from the MTL
and the Avalar Consulate, the world evolved into a
well respected center for youth education and
caretaking.
<P>
The antebellum Urnian subsector was a wild place, and
dangerous too.  The local upper and middle classes
lived precariously, thanks to cutthroat competition
and the militaristic aggressions of factions on Urnain
and Pylkah. Families fearful of their children's
safety began to take advantage of Nanno's expanding
system of services, and by the time of the Third
Frontier War it was customary for the local elites to
ship their children to the world and its well
respected schools and hostels.
<P>
Outside of the port exist about a dozen different
schools, catering to different economic groups or
pedagogical philosophies.  And each of them is a
fortress with their own security services,
self-contained environments, and full recreation and
educational facilities worthy of universities.  These
schools are funded by tuition, government money from
various worlds, and the generous grants of their
well-heeled alumni.  Some of the schools, however,
cater exclusively to the subsectors traders, and are
funded by either shipping corps, or by port fees from
the Nanno government.
<P>
The world's government is best described as a college,
with a number of seperate authorities established at
various intervals in its history to deal with the
world's needs as they came up.  Each contained
community is a seperate yet integrated part of the
planets political infrastructure: there exists
authorities for the starport, security, the
surrounding startown, life support, shipping and
distribution, and the individual school
administrations, all jumbled together in a single
network in support of the world and its continued
survival.
<P>
Unity between these groups is complicated by the
rivalries between the various school staffs and
faculties, and their students. These rivalries are
usually played out in various sport competitions, the
most notable being Nanno field hockey, which is played
in vacuum between opposing teams.  Unlike normal field
hockey, the Nanno variant is very aggressive and
physical, often involving injuries.  In some cases,
these sport rivalries are a substitute for the larger
political and economic controversies of the subsector,
as schools are often polarised between differing
factions.
