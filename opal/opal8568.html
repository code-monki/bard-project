Atsah formerly had been the capitol of Atsah Subsector
under Imperial administration. The world was an
important trade and manufacturing center, and boasted
of a high standard of living. Its prosperity became a
casualty of the Vargr invasion of Corridor, which
severed its trade links, and of Vargr raiding in the
1120s. The world was ceded by the Domain of Deneb, and
it became a part of the DMZ created in Atsah with the
Federation of Dzaargh. Atsah's population has always
been fascinated with politics, particularly political
intrigue. In the wake of its double Abandonment, first
to the Vargr, and then Virus, its political elites
have become masters of survival.
<P>
The world splintered into several factions after the
Collapse, generally city-states seperated by vast
regions of wilderness. Trade caravans of trucks and
huge land trains connect these polities, bringing much
needed goods and commodities. The masters of these
caravans are the primary rulers of each city-state,
and the economic struggles usually form the basis of
all politics on the world. While the world is
nominally balkanised, the worlds rulers usually meet
every two years at the former capitol city of Melva to
elect one of their number as the world's main ruler.
This process is accompanied by much political
jockeying, and sometimes sporadic skirmishing and
strongarm politics. The social system is divided into
extended family/clan systems that dominate entire
neighborhoods. Trade and politics are the two most
esteemed professions, every other worker on the world
is subordinated to the clans that control these
arenas. Intrigue permeates every corner of the world,
and the average citizen keeps careful track of their
relative status and safety in all social contexts.
