Fessenden is the sole moon of Hamadan, a massive world
covered in clouds of insidious hydrogen. The colonists
inhabited it, and hired prospectors to collect gases
and fluids of useful importance to be processed safely
without venturing into the poisonous atmosphere. The
world is extremely hot, and water boiled off of the
local oceans left massive salt deposits in the coastal
deserts, and formed an important chemical industry to
supplement the gas refining.
<P>
The local government was an especially repressive
regime. Cost fluctuations and cutthroat competition
drove many of the local refiners out of business, and
the government became indebted to SuSAG in the
antebellum period. The megacorp invested heavily in
the local economy, virtually building a monopoly, and
appointed a dictatorial oligarchy of consisting of
local elites indebted or tied into the company through
stock ownership or employment. The preponderance of
wealth, and the growing indebtedness of the world's
professional classes, boiled over during the
Representational Reforms. Though SuSAG was forced to
abandon overt political support, enough of its former
officers were emplaced to foil the successful
transition to a democratic government. Guerilla
fighting rages between reform and antebellum factions
in the wilderness, and the cities are subject to
bombings and assassinations.
