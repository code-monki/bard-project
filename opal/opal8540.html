Twinian is a massive chunk of nickel-iron, mixed in
with a variety of other metals. Planetologists think
that this eccentrically orbiting rock is actually a
bizarre instance of accretion of Oort cloud material
that occured early in the systems formation. The world
is located about 120 AUs from its primary, in a
retrogade orbit. The local "rock" is 55% pure metal
ore, but is extremely heterogenous in composition.
Mining is highly specialised, with different companies
extracting different materials for different purposes.
Hence one company may only be interested in
nickel-iron, but may hire another company to extract
any chromium ore it finds in its current mining area.
The world is owned in common by all of the local
companies, which are contractually obligated to fair
play and equal access to mineral finds. Weapons are
illegal, and mining personnel from one company may
only enter another's territory with special
permission.
<P>
Because of its value, the world could not be abandoned
entirely, and the Regency beefed up the local scout
base with additional units. Many ore frieghters making
the run from Zinuun are specially armed with laser and
missle barbettes, and local planetary "navy" is not
wont to asking questions to intruding ships.
