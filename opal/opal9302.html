   <P>

Ake is a cool world covered in extensive ice sheets.
Most of its original atmosphere has leaked away, and
most of its ground water is locked within the
glaciers. Ake was settled for the same reason as
<a href="opal9301.html">Benoncra</A>, strategic location at the end of a J-1
route, in this case the less heavily developed and
travelled Raweh Track.  Settlement was first led by a
small group of Imperial investors in the late 330s,
who constructed a basic D class port that attracted a
trickle of trade.
 <P>
When these investors went bankrupt in 346, their
assets were purchased by a small-time trader, and
convicted forger, named Valeria Yun.  Yun had long
been a thorn in the side of Imperial authorities with
a long history of fraud and forgery crimes.  And
consequently her acquisition of Ake became part of her
continuing criminal activities.  Self styled as the
"Matriarch of Ake," she attracted pirates, confidence
men and other low lifes to congregate under her
watchful eye. To forestall Imperial retaliation, she
permitted enough real trade to create a patina of
legitimacy, to conceal illegal activites and confuse
the authorities.
 <P>
Yun's petty criminal empire eventually passed on to
her adopted daughter, a tradition continued to the
present day. Ake's criminal links have waned
throughout its history, the victim of competition with
better organised syndicates, the latest being the
<a href="opal9000.html">Beyond Sector centered Enterprise</A>.  But the tradition
of determined and strong feminine leadership has been
unbroken, even if it doesn't quite epitomise the
traditional feminist goal of liberation.
 <P>
The Matriarch is essentially an elected post.
Reigning Matriarchs "adopt" a girl or young woman they
percieve as being capable of succeeding them.  While
succession is accomplished without popular consent,
upon the death or resignation of the incumbent, the
Matriarch is subject to annual votes of confidence by
communal procters selected by the populace at large.
An incumbent who recieves a vote of no confidence is
automatically disposed of by her personal Bodyguard,
and her successor is almost always selected, by the
Proctors, from among the Bodyguard.  Votes of no
confidence are limited to constitutional issues like
power abuse, dereliction of duty, and utter
incompetence. Cultural and economic factors are never
factored into these votes, as these are seen as being
outside the Matriarch's control.
 <P>
The world's long association with criminal syndicates
is still heavily impressed upon local culture. While
Ake has a nominal law level of A, it mostly applies to
public areas and open spaces. A lot of malfeasance and
vice occurs within private homes and offices,
untouched by the local security forces. Persons
harrassed while searching for contraband are often
chagrined to discover that most of the local black
marketeers and fixers are the same police agents that
were tailing them earlier. Life on Ake, the locals
like to say, is like an art auction: you pretty much
know what you're going to get, as long as your willing
to pay the price.
 <P>
Aside from the Proctors, whose only authority extends
to overseeing the Matriarch, most local authority
extends to the bosses of local professional and civic
institutions. Much of Akean life is dominated by such
powerful yet petty officialdom, and is another residue
of its criminal past.  While it is ruled by a woman,
strict sexual integration is enforced at all levels of
local society.  Wives and mothers are accorded a
special degree of respect, and the military is a
popular career choice for upwardly mobile woman who
aspire to join the Bodyguard, and maybe become
Matriarch in their own way.
 <P>
Ake's economy largely revolves around commerce coming
down the Raweh Track from <a href="opal9511.html">Froin</A> - Five Sisters, and acts
as a break-bulk point for cargo making the J-2 trip to
<a href="opal9300.html">Noveterre</A>. Consequently it has an oversized starport,
and its low reputation attracts frequent visits from
the RQS garrison on <a href="opal9519.html">Raweh</A>, who, depending upon whom
you're asking, are either making precautionary sweeps,
or are sampling the locals "wares." Ake has enjoyed a
more than ten-fold increase in population, but nearly
all of the migrants have adapted to the local culture
and have little or no trace of their original
homeworld cultures evident.
