Herzenlust's dense atmosphere is home to a variety of
airborne microfauna.  One of these, the Green Fly, is
a deadly parasite that attacks the upper respiratory
tract. A vaccine was developed for the disease about
100 years ago, but is too expensive for the locals to
afford. Instead the colonial government on New Colchis
imports less effective antibiotics, which are
expensive enough on their own, to bind the world and
its population firmly to their imperial control.  As
New Colchis has descended into chaos, a SuSAG
subsidiary has been contracted to continue supplying
the drugs.  Recently SuSAG has negotiated a more
generous contract that gives them an increased share
in local revenues and de facto control over
appointments to the  planetary government.
