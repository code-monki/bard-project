Petrarch is the most heavily populated and
industrialised of the worlds in the Karst cluster,
though it is unimpressive even by the more modest
standards of the Regency. The world is a hot house
with a very high amount of moisture in its atmosphere
due to evaporation. The world is subject to massive
downpours, which will evaporate into steaming,
swirling ground fog known as "kettleclouds." A highly
diverse ecosystem has evolved in this environment, and
the continents are covered in forests of small but
hardy shrub- and chapparal-like plants.  A number of
local flora varieties are cultivated for export, but
the largest crop is an oilseed plant known as
Kinwickseed. Kinwick oil is similar in properties to
more common cooking oils like canola and corn oil, but
it is incompatible with human and vargr chemistry, and
will simply pass through the body without being
absorbed. The existence of this simple fat substitute
makes Kinwick oil a very desirable commodity across
Deneb, and as nearly all of it must be acquired on
Petrarch, high demand brings a relative measure of
prosperity to its growers.
<P>
Most of Petrarch's local industry is concentrated
around the manufacture of spare parts and simple
consumer goods for sale and trade with the Regency
Frontier and nearby Interface.  The local shipyards
are owned by the planetary government, and produce a
limited number of TL-10 and 11 designs for other
planetary governments and local businesses. Most of
the populace lives in small communities that dot the
world, most being excavated out of the ground to
reduce cooling needs.  The oppressive day time
conditions forces people to seek shade or shelter
indoors, and the world only comes to life during the
early evening hours, and it is usually during this
time when most business and recreation is resolved.
Because of this life cycle, Petrarchians often give
the misleading impression of slowness or laziness,
only to strike in a mad frenetic burst of incredible
productivity. These people generally disdain frills or
luxuries, and tend to be disparaging of offworlders
who come to Petrarch unprepared for the local climate.
<P>
Petrarch is one of two worlds in Deneb Sector named
after an important Renaissance poet, the other being
Ronsard/Usani (1830).
