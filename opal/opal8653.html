Nyassl was almost entirely depopulated by the
Abandonment. The Regency Navy was especially urgent in
its efforts to buy out the property of the local
populace, and paid enormous sums to help relocate them
safeside. The official story originally was that the
world was to be converted completely over to staging
dangerous covert operations into the Wilds, and Viral
retaliation was a distinct possibility. But the RASAC
files leaked in 1200 hint that the world is actually a
Viral confinement and quarantine facility. Viruses
captured or brought over from the wilds apparently
make their first stop at specially constructed
facilities on Nyassl and stay for a few years before
disappearing into the extensive network of RASAC
facilities safeside. There is growing public
indignation in some parts of Usani subsector at this
percieved duplicity on the part of the Regency
military.
