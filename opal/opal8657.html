The entire population of Azed Bek works for the Scout
Base. The world has never been that important to
interstellar commerce due to its location and poor
resource base. Several colonies had been established
and failed due to bankruptcy or poor planning. Much of
the problem stems from the impermeable volcanic rock
that covers most of the surface, locking potable water
deep in the crust. The expense of drilling this
resource is more than most colonies can afford, and
has discouraged or drained would be colonists in the
past despite the world's habitability.
<P>
Ironically this made the world a major tourist spot in
the Antebellum period, as its pristine desert
wilderness attracted hunters and nature lovers. Local
animal life is both primitive and unusual, much of its
sessile filter feeders that live in shallow ocean
waters or coastlines, including a few that have
adapted to dry land and filter plant matter out of the
atmosphere.  The Organ Pipe is most famous; a huge ten
foot wide coral like animal with long branching arms
that inhabits the coastal deserts. It recieves its
name from the whistling sounds its body cavities
produce when the local winds blow. Entire regions of
the world play hosts to these natural symphonies, and
made the world a popular destination for travellers
looking for offbeat or less mainstream attractions.
