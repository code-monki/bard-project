   <P>
A Realm is a geographic term used to collectively
refer to a region of territory or space that is
distinct from a another region on the basis of a
dominating culture, economy and political climate.
 <P>
Within the region previously known as "Behind the
Claw", seven distinct realms exist: Regency, Zhodani,
Vargr, Aslan Main, Hinters, Shadow and the Frontier.
Corridor, if it had survived Virus, would have
qualified for inclusion into the Regency or Vargr
realms.  The first three are self explanatory; the
Aslan Main refers to Aslan mainstream within Trojan
Reach sector, where the Hierate has been less
fractured by growing cultural and political
dissension. The Shadow is in reference to those client
states within Far Frontiers, coreward Vanguard Reaches
and Yiklerzdanzh sectors that are heavily impacted by
their close proximity to the Zhodani Consulate. The
Frontier is unincorporated worlds, or non-aligned
polities in Iphegenaia, Fulani and Theta Borealis
sectors, many of which existed only since the 1140s.
No strict borders exist between these realms; rather
transition zones of cultural and political mixing
occur where most of them meet.
 <P>
The Hinters realm is centered upon Beyond Sector, and
the fluid, fractious polities and racially mixed
communities that dominate it.  The realm includes all
of Beyond Sector, Aslan territory in neighboring
Touchstone; The Avalar Consulate and the subsectors
that contain it in Foreven; Menorial and Yggrdrasil
subsectors in Trojan Reach, and the trailing half of
Vanguard Reaches sector (subsectors D, F-H, K-L and
P.) Transition zones exist along the Florian League
interface, Five Sisters/Urnian/Reidan, the trailing
Aslan territories in TS and Beyond, and along VRs
core-rim bisector.
 <P>
The realms main distinction is the fluidity of
communal, political and economic groupings. The
population is an eclectic mix of Solomani, Aslan,
Imperials and local minor races with significant
minorities of Zhodani and Droyne.  Most of these
groups have a history of communal violence, but are
currently too intermingled to replicate the "Cold
Wars" of nearby Far Frontiers sector.  Communal mixing
is abetted by weak states and tepid national
identities.
 <P>
Most of the regions political organisations are
transnational, divided between Corellian, Aslan,
Avalaran and "Enterprise" spheres of control. Corell
dominates chiefly, controlling the Union of Meizirn,
most of trailing Vanguard Reaches, and a number of
systems wedged between it and the Aslan. The Aslan
have conquered most of the rim interface, and has
significant communities within Corellian and Garronean
space. Avalar controls most of the coreward interface,
particularly the Katanga Empire; and most of its
surrouding space.  The Enterprise is a transnational
group consisting of the Federation of Garrone,
Marrekesh Trade League and many independent
nexus-states along the trailing Mortal Coil, down into
the Aslan interface.  The Regency and Florians are
independent powers, the former controlling the
so-called "Approaches" of Reidan and Urnian in
Foreven, Menorial in the Reach, and the Five
Sisters/Daryen interface.
