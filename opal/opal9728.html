Peshtorno suffered heavy collateral damage during the
Ihatei invasions. Possessing a corrosive atmosphere of
hydrofluoric acid, damage to its low tech habitation
domes caused by the fighting created a life or death
situation. After the Ihatei were repelled, the DoD
Naval base commander took control of the government,
and used military engineers to rebuild the damaged
domes. Military administrations are now fairly rare
elsewhere in the Regency, and Peshtorno is often
treated with some contempt by represenatives from more
"progressive" regions and worlds. Despite its peculiar
position, the world is rapidly industrialising, and
will eventually become a high population world in its
own right.
