Hot and dry, Point Ay was not colonised until the
780s. The crust is completely locked up, and surface
water is an expensive commodity. Despite this, or
perhaps because of it, the world is home to some very
massive flora lifeforms. Known as Scales, these are
massive root colonies that mine, collect and store
groundwater in their tissues, and the roots can reach
cover huge areas. To prevent evaporation huge
horizontal plates cover and follow the contour of the
ground for tens to hundreds of square feet, usually
wherever rootstocks reach. The plates are shed and
replaced periodically, and new plates grow on top of
the dead ones. The water resistant cuticles of the
dead plates provide cool shelters for local flora, and
layers upon layers will trap air and ground moisture
in their folds, creating a "drought forest" where a
variety of animals and other plants can survive. These
forests are impassable to most ground vehicles and
humans on foot, requiring the use of grav vehicles to
get around the surface.<P>

Despite this unusual ecosystem, the locals subsist
mostly on offworld trade passing between Deneb and
points located further along the Great Rift. Because
of the local floresence, the downport and the main
settlement is located on a hilltop. The population is
largely employed in maintenance and brokerage jobs,
helping facilitate the movement of cargo. A sizeable
number work for the shipping lines, and several
private merchant academies are present in the downport
for local students interested in a career in space.
