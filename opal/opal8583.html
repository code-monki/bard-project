Amritsar is a rocky, volcanic world. Its continents
are dominated by huge Andean sized mountain ranges,
most of them volcanically active. The degree of
surface relief is incredible, with few elevations
existing between sea level and about 1000 meters (3280
feet). Since early in its history, these mountains,
and the diverse ecosystems they shelter, have been a
source for major offworld tourism. Eco-resorts, and a
plethora of alpine and cold-weather activities draw
tens of millions of sophonts from nearby high
population worlds, people intent upon recreation after
toiling in the factories and offices of Liiri or
Thingen.
<P>
The world is also the sight of a major Ancient site.
Amatuer explorers stumbled across the site, buried
under an avalanche of rubble, in 818. The find was
publicised before IISS and the subsector government
could interdict the site, and it has been public
knowledge ever since. Unlike Dhapura, Amritsar was
inhabited by the Ancients at the time of the Final
War, and the site was severely damaged by planetary
bombardment. It was located in a deep river gorge,
having been cored out of the canyon walls. Bombardment
destroyed a nearby mountain, and the resulting slide
covered up the devastated base, and blocked the
valley. The site has been less remarkable than most,
but it has presented a few mysteries as well,
including the presence of strange crystalline obelisks
made of unknown material and function. Large areas of
the site are offlimits to the public, which is
confined to a touring area operated by the RISS and
the planetary tourism council, and guided tours can
watch areas under excavation, visit the musuem, or
patronise the gift shop.
