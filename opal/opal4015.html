<h3>Imperial Era</h3>

Kelvin was settled in 452, as an industrial base to support the Imperial
explorations / colonisations of the Old Expanses and Solomani Rim. It was
chosen as an industrial centre as the planet was habitable but not prime
colony material due to the large deserts. It was ideal for polluting
moderate TL industries. The system was named after the Terran scientist
"William Thomas Kelvin" and people associated with his life. Kelvin grew
rapidly into an industrial powerhouse supplying moderate TL equipment at
modest prices to the colonies springing up within Diaspora / Old Expanses /
Solomani Rim.
<P>
An extensive B class port grew up to support the flow of materials and
industrial equipment. As the Imperial holdings within the Solomani Rim grew,
Kelvin was chosen as a port on the Imperial X boat network, and the Imperial
Navy established a naval station to provide supplies, berthing, fuel and
accommodation for naval forces moving into the Rim.
<P>
Over the passing centuries, Kelvin's population exploded, and the planets
energies were spent supporting the burgeoning population. Its tech level
remained at TL 9 both to support its substantial niche market and the
expanding population. Most of the population lived in underground cities
away from the dust storms and the heat.
<P>
Cargoes were catapulted across the system from mining sites on the outer gas
giant moons, to the transfer point on "Thomas" and then down to planetside,
using mass-drivers.
<P>
In 1090, Kelvin's starport was replaced with a state of the art TL9 facility
displacing 1 million tons. The port supported the heavy merchant traffic,
the X boat route, the naval station and substantial zero-G industries. The
port was slightly unusual as it was equipped with a large fusion rocket, to
allow corrections due to the gravity perturbations caused by the orbit of
the dwarf star Baron.
<P>
In 1105, the current planetary leader died, and was replaced by his deputy
Joseph Whitworth, a man of fine administrative abilities but little
charisma.

<h3>Rebellion</h3>

With the withdrawal of the Old Expanses sector fleet and the subsequent
rapid advancement of the Solomani fleet, Kelvin became a prime target for
the Solomani due to its high population, industrial base and position on the
X boat route linking the Imperial Core with the Imperial Navy forces holding
out in the Vegan pocket.
<P>
Solomani assaults were initially blunted by Imperial Navy forces in
Diaspora, and the seesaw exchanges between Imperial and Solomani forces in
the Madoc and Khulam subsectors. These exchanges did slowly erode Kelvin's
defence forces, and forced the government to divert efforts into increased
agricultural production and escorts for the merchants bringing in the food.
<P>
Kelvin eventually fell to the Solomani in 1120 after a short siege, primary
due to the disruption to the flow of food. The Solomani turned it into a
defensive bastion at the bottom of the Madoc subsector supporting the
Solomani front line, stretching up to Saagii.

<h3>Hard Times</h3>

The destruction of the Rebellion, including ports and ships caused the
collapse of commercial shipping and with it planetary technology levels and
population. The Solomani occupied planets at the coreward end of the Madoc
and Khulam subsectors were gradually lost, and became independent when the
Confederation could no longer adequately support or defend them. The
Solomani border retreated to a Line from Kelvin, through Montezuma, and
Mitchell up to Desel.
<P>
The Solomani poured resources into Kelvin to support its infrastructure.
They hoped to use it as a bastion for the fleet and to provide much needed
industrial strength to the area. Kelvin's surviving B class port was a prime
recipient of crucial spare parts.
<P>
Even with Solomani assistance, technology dropped slightly to TL8. The drop
in living standards, and large unemployment due to the lack of interstellar
shipping and markets, caused the disillusioned populace to seek religion. A
prophet arose, preaching raising the spiritual above the material. In a wave
of religious fervour, the population swept Prophet Urdol Talstar to power in
1126. Since the start of Urdol's rule, the police became even more
intrusive, as they now sought those with impure thoughts as well as deeds.
<P>
The planet's security was guaranteed by a under-strength flight of TL9 <I>Lone
Wolf</I> SDBs, and the passage of Solomani fleet patrols. Regular Solomani naval
couriers linked Kelvin with the Solomani naval bases in the Khulam
subsector.

<h3>Collapse</h3>

	In 1130, the Solomani fleet courier <I>Runner</I> jumped into the system.
Unfortunately, it was infected with the Reproducing Doomslayer Virus Strain.
It managed to destroy the facilities and population on the moon "William"
with its store of nuclear missiles, whilst the mining and transhipping
facilities on the second moon "Thomas" were heavily damaged by laser fire.
<P>
However, even a TL12 courier is no match for three TL9 SDBs that soon
destroyed the <I>Runner</I>. Prophet Urdol passed it off as a pirate. Then the
virus appeared in the planet's computer net. Initial damage was surprisingly
light, only a few ships few from the skies, and the few fusion plants went
critical. Then the virus infected the Electricity and Water Commission's
computer system. EWC was responsible for distributing water across the
entire planet from vast underground water storage cisterns. EWC shut these
systems down, and let the people die of thirst, (except for the small city
of Windhoven, which it drowned, by opening the irrigation sluice gates). EWC
was destroyed by a desperate rampaging mob, but they could not restore the
water supplies. With a week, almost 6 billion people had died of thirst. The
only areas to survive were those towns located directly over the cisterns or
near natural springs.
<P>
Meanwhile in orbit, Kelvin Highport was also infected by Virus, but the
Highport's computers were state of the art TL13 systems (necessary to keep
the vast port running), and the virus evolved into something more than the
infecting strain - a hobbyist. It looked down on the chaos, and considered
its opinions. It decided not to kill the humans luckily enough to be on the
station at the time, but struck an agreement with the survivors. "Kelvin"
wanted to see the stars (it had looked through its databanks and had become
obsessed with space travel). In return for keeping the survivors alive, and
a promise to eventually settle them on the planet at one or more of the
surviving settlements, the survivors laboured in the orbital factories to
produce a stardrive for "Kelvin".
<P>
Unfortunately, Kelvin lacked facilities to build a jump drive (B port and
TL8), so "Kelvin" looked through its databanks and came up with plans for a
Bussard Ram Jet. After five years, the ramjet was ready, and Kelvin used its
small craft to shuttle the survivors down to the surviving settlements. It
was generous and supplied the settlers with quite a significant amount of
TL9 equipment to allow them to take control of the settlements. Once the
shuttles were back, "Kelvin" lit its fusion rocket and departed for deep
space, loaded down with fuel, and materials.
<P>
Back on the planet, the survivors soon gained control of their various
settlements. Their TL9 equipment was considerably higher than the natives
could muster without electrical power.  However over the decades the ruling
families of the various settlements have fallen out, and the planet is now
balkanised into 14 suspicious, and hostile city states. The vast majority of
the population is stuck in a medieval level of technology TL2, whilst their
rulers enjoy a TL9 existence.

<h3>Planetary Powers</h3>

<h4>Major Powers</h4>
<LI>1 Ardrossan 60,000
<LI>2 Saltcoats 50,000
<LI>3 Hunterston 40,000


<h4>Minor Powers</h4>

<LI>1 Aysle 10,000
<LI>2 Windhook 15,000
<LI>3 Glasgow 15,000
<LI>4 Tarvis 12,000
<LI>5 Trenchant 20,000
<LI>6 Dunganon 25,000
<LI>7 Earlstown 15,000
<LI>8 Aztlan 15,000
<LI>9 Turlog 2,000 Nomadic Band
<LI>10 Rahasia 8,000
<LI>11 Upsherzid 3,000 Nomadic Band
<P>
Hunterston has allied with Tarvis to counter both Ardrossan, and Saltcoats.
The remaining city states are independent, whilst the nations of Turlog and
Upsherzid are little more than nomad bands.
<P>
Meanwhile, on the second moon Thomas, a small continent of the original
miners, etc. are still alive in the ruins of the mining and transhipment
facilities. The population of 148 is centred around, a 50MW fuel cell and
hydroponics area, and have elevated scientists and engineers to high
status - as they keep the life-support running. Unfortunately, a number of
robots from the factory and processing areas are still active and infected
with virus. The robots were courtesy of the Solomani largesse. The robots
attempt to sabotage the life-support systems, but a series of barricades
hinders their access, whilst the natives attempt to isolate the ports on the
remains of the power net system where the robots draw power. Mostly the
robots remain in the factory slowly accumulating power. Only when the
natives send a salvage party into the remains of the factory, do hostilities
tend to start.
