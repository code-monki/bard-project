St. Hilaire was one of the last worlds settled by the
old sublight ships that connected the Islands. After
the colony was recontacted by the Serendips, it has
had a hard time preventing domination by more powerful
offworld parties.  Despite a diverse and lucrative
agricultural economy, despite low temperatures, the
need for offworld capitol and export markets drove the
world first into Serendip's orbit, and then
Esperanza's.  Despite this subjugation, Esperanza's
low antebellum tech level slowed contact, and its
planetary governor enjoyed an unthinkable amount of
autonomy; this is even more true today, as it takes a
round trip of eight weeks for orders and replies to
reach the mother world. Esperanzan sovereignty is now
paid mere lip service, and the world's de facto
independence has been reinforced by the new Regency
naval base.
