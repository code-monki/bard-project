Zeen was colonised by Droyne from an undisclosed
location during the Long Night. Unlike most Droyne
worlds held under Imperial control, Zeen was deemed
too inoffensive to seriously threaten mainstream
culture, and it only languished under an Amber rating
for a short period following the Psionic Suppressions.
The relative seclusion of the local Droyne population
explains this soft treatment, for the downport and its
surrounding area is far from the main settlements, and
their inhabitants rarely interacted with antebellum
period travellers and traders. The population has
slowly come out of its shell since the Collapse, as
the Regency government has actively solicited the
assistance of its Droyne citizens, but contact and
commercial development are still hampered by an
inexplicable reticence on the part of the locals.
