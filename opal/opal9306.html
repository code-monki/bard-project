   <P>


Mainap is the fourth moon of its systems innermost gas
giant, Saipal. A small blue and gold world with
shallow salty seas, and extensive prairies of
golden-purple vegetation, the world failed to attract
any major settlement through most of the Imperial
period. While the world was highly amenable to human
habitation, it lacked any special features that would
have interested serious outside development, and for
the most part it was bypassed by Imperial and Avalaran
interests.
 <P>
Eventually its fall by the wayside attracted a less
savory kind of investment: pirates looking for a
secure base for operations against the meager trade
that passed between Avalar and Imperial space. Mainap
was not only forgiving to human habitation, its
proximity to a gas giant created a secure and
accessible refueling source, and in conjunction with
its nine moons and several rings, a very secure hiding
place for pirate ships, their bases and loot.
 <P>
Pirate shantytowns sprang up on the world's surface,
along with small farms and power plants to support
their populations. Most of these people were merely
pirate dependents, with most actual operations
occuring at well concealed bases in orbit and
neighboring moons, in Saipal proper, or in the systems
planetoid belt and trojans. While nominally allied
with each other, the pirates worked in isolated
self-interest.  Fueds were common and ritualised.
Eventually duelling was prohibited on Mainap itself in
favor of proxy battles on other nearby moons.
 <P>
Unlike the romantic picture often painted about space
pirates, Mainaps pirate families were more akin to
hillbillys than svelte, cackling, parrot dung stained
spacedogs.  Few if any of them were that well
organised or determined at succeeding at piracy. Few
had topline ships, or very many resources at all. Most
pirate families scraped a meager living. Retaliatory
sweeps from nearby Imperial naval bases removed the
more successful from contention, and the remaining
pirates were just as happy to farm as they were to
ravage the surrounding
 <P>
But from time to time a particularly determined group,
usually fugitives from another part of Imperial Space,
would alight into the system, and by dint of their
ruthlessness dominate and subordinate the other
pirates to their control.  In the years following the
Fifth Frontier War, Mainap was controlled by one of
the worst bands to soil Foreven in its long history. A
band of former Imperial privateers that called
themselves the Lost Souls stole a pair of Mosquito
class Escorts from a repair yard in Vilis subsector,
and fled to Mainap in 1112. After spending about two
years overawing the locals, the Lost Souls proceeded
to bathe a good portion of Urnian and Five Sisters in
blood.
 <P>
They weren't particularly daring or even very smart.
The 'Souls simply didn't care about what they did, or
how they managed to accomplish it. And sometimes their
victims and passerby were left to wonder if they even
cared to accomplish anything, other than acts of
freakish violence. (In Hard Times parlance, the Lost
Souls were a Viking lager with Ripper pathologies, a
rather lethal combination) That a military unit could
carry out such violence, and still retain its unity
led to whispers along the frontier that the Souls were
an Imperial marine or naval unit that went rogue when
its tactics and methodologies were no longer needed in
the peace with the Zhodani.
 <P>
For about a decade, the Lost Souls wreaked havoc with
local shipping and communities. Fortunately, their
only penchance was for violence, not organisation of a
syndicate, or anything more positive.  And their
strength was diluted by a war with another Fifth War
group of retreads with the improbable name Forked
Tong. The fued between these two groups diverted their
attention from the warming trend between the Zhodani
and the Domain of Deneb, which permitted the latter to
increase its patrols in Urnian, and increase the level
of firepower as well. By 1124, both groups had
battered themselves silly, and the DoD patrols quickly
terminated the survivors.
 <P>
The Domain also brought Mainap under its control. The
populace had tired of the Lost Souls tyrannical grip,
and were weary of their lifestyle. A scout base was
constructed, and the pirate shantytowns were cleared
out and replaced with permanent housing. Under the
careful supervision of IISS, and later RISS, the
locals were placed in compulsory vocational training,
and many took up legitimate space trade. Their numbers
were supplemented, and then overtaken by a stream of
new colonists attracted to the system and its untapped
potential.
 <P>
Mainap is now a major commercial hub. It possesses one
of Urnian's two A-class starports.  It also contains
the district HQs of many Regency corps and financial
institutions.  The influx of money, at the crossroads
with commercial necessity, makes the world a luxurious
stopover for commercial and military crews travelling
through the subsector.  But a faint echo of its past
still remains within the less travelled portions of
the system, and within the casual expressions and
motions of a major portion of the population. It is
undefinable, yet it definitely adds a static spark to
the world's atmosphere, a sense of pregnant urgency, a
spark of danger almost.......
