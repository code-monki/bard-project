Andalia's amber zone is due to the near total
disappearance of oxygen from the world's atmosphere
during winter and spring in the temperate and polar
latitudes. Filter masks will not work in this
atmosphere, only respirators during the high O2
season, and PLSS during the low season.  The world is
less than a billion years old, and its only life are
anaerobic microorganisms and primitive
photosynthesizers. Most of the population works in
deepwater mining sites, mining metals or the
suprisingly rich gemstone beds for export to Inar or
Vincennes subsectors.  Emeralds and sapphires are the
richest of the world's exports, and the mines that
produce them are closely guarded by their owners.
Andalia's downport is located on Andalia's small moon,
Iskanderia, as the world itself has no significant
land surface for the construction of anything beyond
simple landing pads.
