The homeworld of the Shi'awei minor race. Imperial
Scouts discovered this world in 314, and interdicted
the world in accordance with Imperial Law.  before
1073 the world was listed as 314-765, and was
patrolled regularly by IISS cruisers. At the time of
its discovery, Imperial law regarding contact with
primitive races had become punitive regarding outside
interference.  The Shi'awei were barely TL 1 at that
time, and had no concept of the universe outside of
their world, and their race was one of the first to
benefit from these more stringent regulations.
<P>
In 1073, however, the liner Ishgarlu, misjumped
insystem from nearby Mora subsector. A computer
failure caused the ship's jump field to malform, and
the ship jumped parsecs off course. Its communications
were knocked out, preventing a mayday, and the vessel
precipitated too close to the world for the scout
cruisers to detect. The ship crashed in a shallow
shoal, alerting the curious Shi'awei, who explored the
wreck and interacted directly with the survivors.
Several days passed before the crew managed to salvage
a radio with a range long enough to contact the
interdiction patrol. The rescue and recovery of the
Ishgarlu and its survivors took several days, further
contaminating the world.
<P>
The incident sparked a major controversy within the
IISS and subsector nobility. A debate raged between
senior bureaucrats who resented the Ishgarlu's
intrusion, and oppurtunistic academics and IISS
contact specialists who urged a lifting of the world's
interdiction. A compromise was worked out in 1075 that
opened the world to limited contact, through the
auspicies of IISS, and the interdiction was raised to
a partial quarantine. The Imperium, and later the
Regency, lucked out with the Shi'awei, who are by
nature a curious and gregarious race, lacking
xenophobia and free of the dogmatic superstitions that
contact specialists use to justify the interdiction of
developing cultures. Indeed the Shi'awei have adapted
so well to offworld contact that it sparked a major
controversy in the Imperial bureaucracy in the last
few years before the Civil War over the entire
validity of the non-interference philosophy.
<P>
Commercial contact on Chaosheo is limited to the
Crashsite Downport, located, naturally, near the
Ishgarlu's old crash site, and a surrounding
commercial zone 15 km in diameter. Supervised trade
has allowed the aliens to dramatically increase their
technological repertoire, and a number of industrial
goods are being produced locally. The Shi'awei are
very good at abstract thinking, and hands on
artisanship, and a small number of their best and
brightest have journeyed to Regency universities to be
educated in various subjects.
