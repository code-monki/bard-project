Koshadi is a sad world, literally. The world is
shrouded in heavy mists created by extensive geyser
and volcanic activity, and these make it a gloomy
place to visit. The world is one of the most
volcanically active worlds in Foreven, a result of its
young age and very massive core. Rapid plate movements
create rifts within the crust, through which basaltic
magma pours in huge floods the land in seas of molten
rock, often to a thickness of 10 meters over hundreds
of kilometers. Entire regions can vanish beneath hot
rock in a matter of just a few days, their original
surface features buried or melted away.
<P>
The atmosphere is heavily tainted with the CO2 and
sulfur exhalations of these eruptions, making the air
irritating to the skin, and poisonous to breathe.
Potable water is difficult to obtain, and in many
areas lakes have formed around calderas, and contain
poisonous gasses at their bottoms that will asphyxiate
everything for kilometers if disturbed by landslides
or new eruptions.  Most of the planets native life is
microorganisms, many of which have adapted to life in
hot springs and other normally inhospitable places,
respiring chlorine or hydrogen sulfide.
<P>
The world was settled by breakaway colonists from
nearby Tepenke (Foreven 1926) around -365. Why they
chose this particular world is difficult to say
nowadays. Perhaps they were desperate for any world of
any kind. Or maybe the survey data was incomplete or
incorrect. Whatever the reason, a large colony was set
up within the Gorphee Coast, a coastal basin notorious
for volcanic and seismic activity.  The early
colonists subsisted on simple agriculture and
primitive mineral extraction of certain ores needed
for the manufacturing of implements. A number of
natural disasters slowly degraded their ability to
maintain their technology, and remain a unified and
cohesive community. Disputes and dissension caused
several parties to decamp for the outback, and by -250
the world had effectively become balkanised.
<P>
A major eruption destroyed the Gorphee in -198,
burying what remained of the original colony under a
50 meter thick layer of 1600 degree celsius magma.
What colonists weren't killed in the eruption fled
hundreds of kilometers into the surrounding
wilderness, bringing them into contact, and conflict
with the earlier departees.  The world slid into
barbarism, and the survivors coalesced into nomadic
tribes that moved as local conditions dictated. Most
of these tribes developed taboos against technology
and offworld contact, and exploratory teams that
visited the now obscure world were often ambushed and
killed by the natives.
<P>
Zhodani and <a href="opal9351.html">Xenough</A> military units skirmished over
Koshadi briefly during their protracted guerilla war,
and both factions contacted and jostled the local
tribes in hopes of recruiting them as soldiers or
laborers.  In many cases these indigenous workers were
paid in offworld trade goods, and the old taboos
against offworld contact slowly eased once its benefit
to local communities became clear.  Unfortunately, the
opposing efforts of the Zhodani and the Kokol caused a
permanent cultural divide between their respective
indigenous allies that persists to the current day.
<P>
Since the 400s, the world has been differentiated
between the Zhodani influenced Orpelsen, and the
Xenough dominated Ivakol. The Orpelsen have mimiced
many aspects of Zhodani culture, including an almost
religious respect for psionics, though they have not
progressed as far due to technical and political
difficulties. The Ivakol have a caste structure that
is almost identical to the Xenoughian Kokol, but it
has obtained religious justification from the
traditional sects that flourished among the older
tribal groupings. Both groups enforce strict obedience
in their communities, often with the aid of empowered
secret police or moniters.
<P>
The elevation of their respective ideologies into the
realm of belief has converted local secular conflicts
into controversies of faith between respective sets of
believers and infidels. The two factions have managed
to start and prosecute constant wars with each other
without any offworld assistance other than verbal
encouragement. The retreat of the Zhodani hasn't
stemmed the Orpelsen, indeed the assistance of their
cousins on Tepenke, and aid from the Avalar government
has enabled them to conquer the entire planet on at
least three occasions. Xenough's retreat from
interstellar prominence after being annexed by the
Avalar Consulate severly hurt the Ivakol's ability to
stave off their enemies assualts, and they're unity
has been hurt by internal controversies and schisms.
Nevertheless, the Orpelsen have not displaced the
Ivakol's culture or belief structure, and their
takeovers have merely caused the latter to reunify and
wage bloody guerilla wars that have undermined their
attempts to dominate the world.
<P>
Outside travellers will find that Koshadi is a
treacherous place to visit. The alliances that make up
the two factions are as shifty as the local terrain,
and just as quietly volatile. The Orpelsen are quite
friendly with offworlders, particulary Zhodani, though
they welcome Regency citizens with little fuss. The
Ivakol are just the opposite: suspicious, aloof and
quick to anger. Their politics are tangled, and blood
feuds are common between regions and local
"brotherhoods".  The local Poilu and Geneeari (see
Xenough) are considered to be the property of the
Ivakol in general, and their lives are harsh. Even
worse, many offworlders are often attacked or
kidnapped by overly zealous or xenophobic Ivakol
militiamen, and are often added to the lower castes.
For this reason many Ivakol areas are Amber Zones, and
visits without permission or Ivakol escort is not
recommended.
