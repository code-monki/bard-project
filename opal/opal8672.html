Vincennes has already been heavily detailed in MegaTraveller Journal 3.
But there have been major changes in its mindset and
economic geography since the Collapse.
<P>
The Collapse, and to a more critical extent the Rape
of Trin severely impacted Vincennes. One of the most
advanced worlds in the former Third Imperium, and one
of its most storied, suddenly faced the fact that its
raison d'etre, technological advancement, could
possibly doom it and the rest of the Regency. In the
massive backlash against automated technologies in the
wake of the Rape, Vincennes went from being most
favored to being most ambivalent, and in some quarters
of Regency society, most reviled.
<P>
Once the unthinkable happens, nothing is unthinkable
anymore. Its position in the spotlight now made it an
easy target for both Virus and the disdain of
technophobes after the embers of Trin began to cool.
For Vincennes that meant having to reexamine virtually
every aspect of its society and its attitudes towards
the remainder of the Regency. What once was the
Emerald City, with its homebody, luxury loving
population, now had to turn itself inside out to
educate, elevate and emancipate its fellow citizens
across the Regency. This wasn't purely altruism; the
new bureaucratic government installed in the 1140s
recognised that the only means of their world's
survival was to create reciprocal relationships with
more downtrodden worlds. With technological
development impeded by the "cap" imposed by the First
Regent, helping improve local living conditions and
technology of as many worlds as possible would mean
the cap would eventually be lifted, and the
synergistic benefits of cooperation with these
offworld parties would make it even easier for
Vincennes to remain competitive.
<P>
The world constructed five of the largest and most
prestigious universities as a result, the "Golden
Ring" schools, which attract the best and brightest
from across the Regency to learn cutting edge science
and technology, economics and public service, psionics
and interstellar relations. Two of these, Golden Gate
and Golden Horn, are placed in orbit near Vincennes
two highports, and are given over mostly to offworld
students. The other three, Golden Harvest, Golden Sun
and Golden Dragon are all built near the worlds three
major metroplexes. The Regence University of Vincennes
is also a major supporter of educational dissemination
as well. With the aid of these universities, Vincennes
was quickly able to repair the damage done to its
technological abilities by the Viral threat, and spur
continuing innovation that will allow a rapid
transition to TL-17 when that day comes.
<P>
Vincennes demographic geography has been heavily
altered since the Rape of Trin. Most of its grav
cities are now primarily industrial or support
facilities that produce vital goods year round for
export offworld. Its ocean metroplexes, located in the
region known simply as the Shoal, now contain a
greater percentage of the population than they did in
the past. The Kehmed and Willis metroplexes are the
largest population centers, but Markel, Burke and the
new Moses metroplexes are just as vital and important.
 New smaller metroplexes are being constructed on the
continental shelves on the Shoal's eastern margin, as
new deepwater technologies open up previously
unexploited areas of the seafloor.
<P>
Vincennes' reliance upon Paven for imported foodstuffs
has diminished as the population has grown. The
vulnerability of these shipments compelled the local
communities to develop alternative agriculture, in
many cases either grown on gravitic platforms, or in
orbit on massive space stations. The possibilities
offered by genetic engineering and biorganic
constructs has also influenced local life support
system design: Hydroponics and specially engineered
aquatic plants are used by many surface and underwater
installations as backup life support systems, and are
the basis of several new research ventures into
biorganic machinery and systems.
<P>
Vincennes decentralised government has diminished in
the face of Virus and the Representational Reforms.
The hated Vincennes Trade and Commerce Commision
(VTCC) has had its influence overshadowed by a new
civil service bureaucratic government instituted by
the Duke of Vincennes in 1141. A new popular assembly
was created during the Representational Reforms, led
by several new political parties formed by an
increasingly mobile middle and working classes.
