Smaller Besancon is a whisp of a world. Early on it
was colonised from Joyeuse, and mining of local
mineral resources permitted the construction of a much
larger colony. When these played out, more than
seventy percent of the population left for more viable
worlds. The remaining population was decimated by
further emigration, which accelerated after the local
introduction of jump drive. The world became important
once again after New Colchis discovered extensive
lanthanum deposits, and the world became a major
battleground during the Islands War. Most of the
population is remote from the actual battlefields, and
living standards are as a result much higher here than
on war torn Elysee.
