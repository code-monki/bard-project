Giffert is an icy cored world with an enormous amount
of carbon in its mantle. Somehow the world avoided
attracting very many heavy elements during its
accretion, and the pressure and temperature encouraged
the formation of complex hydrocarbons. The world was
discovered by Third Imperium prospectors in 117, and
was quickly colonised. Because of the unique nature of
its geology, explotation of the world required the
very best technology the Imperium could offer. Most of
this material comes from Lilad, and despite the
treacherous environment, the worlds habitats have
never suffered a major life support failure.
<P>
Visitors to the world will find a planet shrouded in a
thick oily fog caused by thermal heating. The ground
is a slushy tundra covered in a mixture of tar and
frozen methane/water. The main settlements are giant
spheres perched on special platforms that allow for
quick relocation. These are strategically placed in
production areas to allow for easy movement of
workers, who usually work in refineries or on mobile
landing/loading platforms. The rest of the world is
criscrossed with drilling and extraction derricks,
pipelines and roads for robotic work units.
