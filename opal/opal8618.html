Taillon was set aside by the sector government in 1101
as a reserved settlement for the Imperium's various
acquatic sophonts. The settlements of "dry" sophonts
are limited to the highport and a small number of
floating habitats. The two dominant groups are
Dolphins and Githiaskio, which get along rather well
with each other. The colonial council on Inar is
protective of its citizens privacy, which has
intensified into near isolation in reaction to the
Collapse. Major offworld development is strictly
limited by the government.
<P>
News of Virus caused a panic among the local acquatic
communities, and they withdrew from most offworld
contact, fearing that the Regency would be the next to
fall. They took extreme measures to protect
themselves, including the construction of hidden
technical and supply caches, and gradually withdrawing
to more remote parts of the world-ocean. These
measures have reduced trade, and prevented Regency
government from doing an updated census for nearly
seventy years. Local human communities are still
trusted, and have grown rich from their middleman
position.
