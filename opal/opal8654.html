Arcanum is evidence of some kind of bizarre whimsy in
the former Imperial administration. The world is an
experimental colony that was established in the
aftermath of the Psionic Suppressions, designed to
observe social development in primitive human
cultures. The original population was generated in
vitro, raised to adulthood by the research station
personnel, and then released onto the world with only
dim memories of their childhood. As these primitive
humans and their Edenic society developed, the gods
(research personnel) would clandestinely monitor their
progress.
<P>
As demented or egotistical at this project sounds, it
was grounded in real scientific need when it was
initiated. Sophontologists working with human
subspecies wanted a better distinction between
naturally evolved human traits and those engineered by
the Ancients. It was also done against the rising tide
of eugenics and geneering programs that flourished
prior to the Solomani Rim War. But as with most
paternalistic programs, Arcanum became a victim of its
own hubris. After the Rim War, the eugenics fad faded
away, and the project fell largely to the wayside. Its
funding was cut several times, and Research Station
Alpha was held up by critics as a mockery of
scientific principles and common sense.
<P>
All of this changed during the Civil War. Because of
Vargr raiding along the Deneb-Corridor interface there
existed the very real fear that the world would be
abandoned to its fate. Alpha personnel lobbied then
Archduke Norris for years to keep the facility open
and Imperial contact present on the world. After Virus
was released, the government relented in allowing
millions of the locals to be evacuated safeside.
Because of their adaptions to a very thin atmosphere
most were resettled without adverse effects to Deneb,
where they have converted to To Will One Thing and are
fully integrated into the Regency mainstream. The
future status of the world remains undecided, though
expatriates have expressed their intention of
returning to their homeworld and modernising it.
