Raweh was, literally, the middle of nowhere, the last
resort, the point of almost no return. Along with
Emape it was the farthest spinward extent of the Third
Imperium, a remote peninsula in a remote subsector.
Raweh has no resources, no refueling sources, and is
uglier than hell.  But its strategic location along
the j-1 route linking Five Sisters with neighboring
Menorial subsector (Trojan Reach A) and the difficulty
of maintaining contact between this remote border and
more settled regions compelled the Imperial Navy to
build a small naval base for surveillance and X-boat
support purposes.
   <P>
Aside from the base personnel, the world's only other
antebellum settlers were a strange cult known as the
Church of the Golden Sands. Founded by a Fornice born
vagabond trader named Versan Igalanor in 1058, the
church seeks religious enlightenment and divine
portents within the strange shapes created in Raweh's
frozen silicate sands by the wind. Starting with a
small following that included his family and the crew
of his broken down far trader, Igalanor soon attracted
many of the subsectors other downheeled adventurers,
creating a colony that numbered into the thousands.
Unlike most cult leaders, Igalanor lacked any tendency
towards self-destructive mania, and the cult survived
his passing in 1105. Despite its pacifistic nature,
its strange rituals and its liturgical emphasis upon
ecstatic mind states unsettled the naval authorities
enough to garner an Amber Zone.
   <P>
The Collapse and subsequent change in Five Sister's
importance transformed Raweh from a remote border post
into an important trade waystation. The explosion of
trade along the aforementioned j-1 route, now known as
the Raweh Track, required that the base and commercial
starport be upgraded and expanded. A private company
was contracted by the Ministry of the Interior to run
the new starport and startown. RQS and the Navy
expanded the base to support the new customs and
SSIIO.
   <P>
The world's intermediate location along the Raweh
track made inspections problematic for most traffic,
however. Most short jump vessels must enter the
Regency twice, first at Raweh, and then at either
Froin or Lakou. This requires discretionary
inspections, with concentration upon vessels that
actually intend to proceed into the Regency, either by
the Andor-Candory route. Vessels intended for Froin,
or using Raweh to transition from Foreven to either
Florian space or the Aslan frontier are only given
cursory inspections, and their transponders are
"notched" to prevent smuggling or vessel identity
theft.
   <P>
Interestingly, the Church of the Golden Sands have
slowly migrated out of their sanctuaries into the
vicinity of the starport.  They have taken jobs, and
now own many small businesses that cater to the
itinerant ship crews.  Their attempts to proselytize,
and the now up close and public nature of their
rituals no longer make the authorities so uneasy.
Nevertheless the worlds heavy naval presence and
precarious position along the Regency frontier are now
the justifications for worlds Amber Zone.
