<HR><P>
The Oriflamme Navy names ships, which are defined as having jump drives, and numbers non-jump craft.
Each boat or monitor has an unofficial name created by the enlisted members of the crew.
The officers do not get a vote or a veto.  The enlisted personel can change the
nickname based on a majority vote.  Usually the nickname of the ship and a motto
gets painted on a wall in the galley.
The exception to this is relic ships which have been converted to monitors.  If they had a name before conversion, the name is kept, though they are also given a number.
<P>

The jump capable ships were all recently refitted with imported parts from the Hive Federation and Aubaine. The Oriflammi navy retains the names of captured or recovered ships.  Renamed ships carry a onus of bad luck.
<P>
Note - Not all the ships in the list have been giving names.  This allows the individual referee some latitude
in naming ships, also we couldn't think of all of them ourselves.  Suggestions for names, can be submitted to the editor.

<P>
<h3><I><a href="../sara/sara0000.html">Thresher</A></I> SDBs</h3>
B101 <I>Numero Uno</I>   - Prestige ship often with those personally associated with prominent Technarch's, but which
                      conveniently rarely sees action.  AKA "Technarch's Toddlers" by other crews. <BR>
B102 <I>Second to One</I>-crews self deprecating joke on their numerology! They get all the  missions  <I>Numero Uno</I> avoids.<BR>
B103 <I>The Lady</I> - No good reason, it just was the best submitted name when the first crew came aboard.  <BR>
B104<BR>
B105 <I>Von Hamman's Bastards</I> - Named for the captain: Yuri Von Hamman.<BR>
B106<BR>
B107<BR>
B108 <I>The Frigid Bitch</I> - environmental system error causes very cold but deemed "habitable" and thus never refitted.<BR>
B109<BR>
B110<BR>
B111 <I>Three Aces</I> - for fifteen kills, considered a lucky ship, hard charging (gung-ho) type of CO, good disciplined crew.<BR>
B112<BR>
B113 <I>Lucifer's Hammer</I> - "cursed" ship, high wear value, low priority for repair/refit<BR>
B114<BR>
B115<BR>
B116<BR>
B117<BR>
B118<BR>
B119<BR>
B120<BR>
B121<BR>
B122 <I>Deuces Wild</I>  another "lucky" ship. seems to never have mishaps. High morale<BR>
B123 <I>Follow Me!</I>- Always in the lead. "First to fight, Last to leave"  crew's motto.<BR>

<h3><I><a href="../sara/sara0002.html">Storm</A></I> Monitors</h3>
M201 <I>Six Kills and Counting</I> <BR>
M202  <I>The Double-Deuce</I>--AKA the "Catch 22" ship of cynical crew derision. Low crew morale.<BR>
M203<BR>
M204<BR>
M205 <I>Grim Reaper</I> - had nearly as many fatal crew accidents as enemy KIA<BR>
M206<BR>
M207<BR>
M208<BR>
M209<BR>
M210<BR>
M211<BR>
M212  <I> The One Hundred -Cee</I>--for the temperature water boils. The opposite effect of B-108 seems to afflict this vessel,
creating a sauna like affect but  sensors read "habitable". Ironically the number 212  is also the fahrenheit  for boiling water!
The crew has the nickname the "Hot-house Gang" when ashore. Judging from the Fights the crew gets into, hot tempered as
well.<BR>
M213<BR>
M214<BR>
M215 <I>Gals we Had</I>--another ship for crew's (bad) luck ashore with the opposite gender.<BR>
M216 <I>Lance 'Er Alot</I> - Crew with the most colorful unit history (misfits)<p>


          <h3><I>Hammer</I> Monitors</h3>
M301 <I>Flaming Death</I> - No real story behind this name, the crew thought it sounded cool.  <BR>
M302 <I>Thor's Own</I> (Hammer) - One of the most decorated and skilled (Crack crew?)<BR>
M303 <I>Nieblung's Anvil</I>--a crack crew,(?) named for the device upon which Thor's Hammer, Mjolnir was forged.<br>
M304<BR>
M305<BR>
M306<BR>
