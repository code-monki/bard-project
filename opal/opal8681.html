Echura was colonised in the 340s by settlers intent
upon harvesting the local fauna, which included a
number of species that yielded vital medicinal
compounds. Because of its strategic value, the
Imperial government created the Marquis of Echura,
under whom the offworld export of all pharmaceuticals
nationalised and monopolised, and brought the local
processing and drug plants under direct noble control.
Complaints of favorable treatment of offworld corps,
and low prices and pay for field workers and farmers
led to growing resentment, and several revolts in the
antebellum period.
<P>
Another revolt broke out in 1113, and guerilla
fighting raged on for decades in spite of the greater
national emergencies that consumed the Domain and
Regency. Attempts at mediating between the Marquis and
rebels were undermined by high drug prices, as both
sides attempted to control field production. Offworld
smuggling, always a problem, became endemic and
uncontrolled even as the RQS tried to crackdown.
Finally a Representational Referendum was held in
1167, the results of which gave power to a moderate
assembly at the Marquis' expense. When the Marquis
attempted to overthrow the council, the rebels
assassinated him and his family.
<P>
Since the overthrow of the Marquis, the most difficult
problem has been reintegrating former rebel
strongholds into the new government. Years of warfare
has hardened the attitudes of inhabitants in those
regions, who are libertarian and wish to be left alone
by the civil government and its regulations, which are
indistiguishable from the old government in the eyes
of radicals. Armed confrontation has been avoided by
careful diplomacy, and the improving prosperity of
Echurans in general now that the old trade monopoly
has been terminated.
