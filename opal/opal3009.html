In the days before the Rebellion Janazzo made it's money supporting the Trade along
the So Skire Main into Spica. It was run, benevolently enough, by the Janazzan 
Mercantile Association, and the money flowed in and everyone was happy. The Rebellion 
brought hard times, with Hiver Trade into the Expanses nearly non-existent the world
fell into a depression. This was slightly ameliorated by the fact that the system was 
close to several hi-population worlds, such as Cobham. By the time the Virus came the 
world's Orbiting port was functional, but in need of repair, which was the one thing 
that saved it. When the Virus attempted to invade the station it found that all it's
vectors were blocked, makeshift terminals were linked to the comms, and processed by
humans, ships were not connected up to the local net when they docked because it had 
ceased to exist - worst of all the main computer had been taken off line and replaced
by an amalgam of TL-8 processors incapable of sustaining sentience. <P>

The Free Traders came early to Janazzo, and exchanged relic equipment for servicing at
the orbital port, where the Droyne technicians worked wonders on drives that seemed fit
for scrap. With this increase in trade, the importance of the Starport grew, and with 
little opposition the Starport Authority joined the ranks of the Mercantile Association.
Over the 70 years to the New Era the Port grew, adding Fission reactors, hydroponic
bays, repairing the damage the neglect of the Rebellion wrought. Now, in 1202 it is 
in better shape than it was in the mid 1200's.<P>

The System's main exports are repaired relics, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and processed 
ores from it's inner and outer belts. Traders from as far as Zephir in Dagir Subsector 
in Alpha Leonis, and Renj in Sitah Subsector voyage to Janazzo. Recently a few Hivers 
have visited, though after acting very odd they left - to the puzzlement of the natives.
Ships from all over the subsector come for repairs, even from the xenophobic world of
Schotz.<P>

The world's defences are minimal, only the two SDBs based at the port, and it's own 
defences, consisting of particle accelerator and missiles bays and laser turrets are
of note.<P>

Baldur's colony on Poyzen has not come to their attention yet, but when it does they'll
welcome trade and relations with it.<P>
