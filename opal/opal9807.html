Adhara is one of the strangest worlds ever discovered
within charted space, and it constitutes a class of
its own.  It is the smallest water world on record,
measuring a mere 3500 kms in diameter, and it seems to
be too small to support such a massive hydrosphere.
<P>
Adhara is mysterious for one more reason: the world
has an incredible amount of geothermal heat.
Planetary surveys indicate that at one time, Adhara
had a complex composition of cometary debris, bare
rock and large amounts of frozen water, a composition
more commensurate with the systems Kuiper Belt than
deeper insystem.  Theorists think that the world was
somehow dislodged from the Belt by a passing star or
extrasolar gas giant early in the systems formation,
and was hurled into the inner system, eventually
coming to orbit within the systems habital zone.
<P>
But theorists are stumped about the worlds
transformation after that.  It is clear that most of
the water melted, but mostly because of the internal
geothermal heat rather than solar warming.  The
process that drives this massive heating is still
unknown, though current consensus is that it is some
kind of crude solid state fusion process.  The heat is
so great that parts of the world ocean practically
boil due to volcanic vents within the sea floor.  Some
of this heat may be due to the lack of tectonic
plates.
<P>
Adhara's oceans average about 35 to 45 degress
celsius, and are often too hot for immersion with bare
skin.  Water temperatures vary throughout the oceanic
thermocline, either hotter at the surface and colder
near the bottom, or vice versa.  This creates huge
thermal bores and convection currents within deep
oceanic troughs, and an undersea "jet stream" that
rings the equatorial region, that can be harnessed for
power generation.  In some regions fumaroles
kilometers in height create massive undersea geysers
that often break the ocean surface, creating a spray
of hot, mineral rich water that can be lethal to the
unwary. The locals call their homeworld the "cosmic
teakettle."
<P>
Adhara's high water temperature, heavy hydrogen
sulfide taint, and exotic life prevented settlement
until 810. A coalition of companies and wealthy
individuals was formed on nearby Armada to exploit the
worlds untapped resources, and the first colonists
were sent in with specially insulated protable
"atolls" to live on.  These colonists are primarily
miners and bio- prospecters, as most of the local life
is inedible to humans and aquafarming is difficult in
the high water temperatures. The locals are a hardy
down-to-earth group, who have infinite reserves of
patience and a careful work-a-day pace to their lives.
 They also have a lively contempt of their bosses on
Armada, though no real desire for independence.
<P>
The local lifeforms are mostly exotic invertebrates
that resemble Terran tubeworms and large nematodes.
The temperature variations of Adhara's oceans
encourage diversity, and the development of
microclimes, many of which remain unexplored. A number
of commerciallly lucrative discoveries have been made
among the local life, most of it relating to the
materials industry.  It is estimated that less than
half of the planets biomass has been cataloged and
studied, and that many deep oceanic lifeforms have not
been studied due to their proximity to volcanic vents
or rifts.
