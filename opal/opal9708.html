Amondiage was the second of the Islands worlds to be
settled by the ESA Long Range Colony Mission, in this
case by the Voyageur in -6.  Amondiage is a world
under heavy geological pressure. Tectonic motion on
this world is mostly vertical, as on Venus in the Sol
System. In a few areas, the plates have parted enough
to permit the creation of deep rifts or depressions
where surface water has pooled to create small seas.
The rest of the world is dry, dusty desert with few
resources worth developing.  The three largest seas
are surrounded by Himilaya sized mountain ranges and
escarpments that shelter verdant grasslands and
forests; temperatures are significantly cooler here,
and nearly the entire population lives in packed
cities along the shorelines or on small, intermontane
plateaus.  Land is scarce, and the population engages
in strict ecological practices that limit population
growth, and recycles water and waste.  Large scale
industry is limited by the lack of resources, and most
manufacturing and commerce was initially carried out
by small but highly efficient factories and business
groups.
<P>
Because of the great distances between the individual
"Massifs" and "Mares", the planetary government was
imposed by the largest and most powerful group of
communities, a coalition known as the Tokapi, which
was headquartered on an island in the middle of the
largest Mare.  A series of popular dictators, elected
for life by the Tokapi elite, ruled the world in a
semi-enlightened fashion, promising the other
subjugated communities to provide the fruits of empire
in return for their support. After a very brief
takeover by Serendip in the early 1000s, this
imperialism metastisized into full fascism, and the
world's economy was socialised, and were transformed
into massive enterprises to construct an oversized
military bent upon conquering the universe (or at
least the local portion of it) for the motherworld.
<P>
The world and its forces were led into the Islands War
by the reckless hand of the dramatic, handsome,
charismatic (and brainless) dictator Auguste de
Froidesval, whose sole heroic contribution to the war
effort was to get himself and most of his command
staff killed in a moronic frontal assualt against a
New Home fleet. The worst damage was inflicted by
Sansterre, whose forces quickly destroyed most of the
local navy in quick, brutal strikes in the first few
years of the war. Froidesval's death, and the loss of
most of the officer corps in these battles left a
leadership vacuum that could only be filled with less
competent and resolute officers, and Amondiage became
an appendage to the rest of the war, as it forces lost
the initiative and inertia prevented capable response
to enemy moves.
<P>
Disgust with the entire misadventure, and the growing
number of coups and assassinations carried out by
would be dictators, led the subjugated communities to
progressively secede from Tokapi's control. Several
Vampire fleets succeeded in reaching Amondiage in the
mid 1130s, destroyed several communities with orbital
bombardment weapons, and intensified the anarchy.
Regency forces arrived in late 1140 to find a world on
the verge of ruin, with most of its industry and
starports shattered beyond repair. Careful
reconstruction by outlying communities has pulled the
world back from the brink, and restored most
technology and starports.  But Tokapi and her allies
are still consumed with coups and intrigue, and small
brushfire wars have been fought between them and their
former subjects. Meanwhile, Tokapi's interstellar
forces remain in combat postions on St. Genevieve, and
are still pursuing hostilities against the other
Islands. The defenestration of Tokapi and her troops
is the main barrier to the Four-Power Talks success
and the rehabilitation of the Old Islands.
