In contrast to most Rampart worlds, Rubrak welcomed
Logasllu and Baknaeleur refugees with open arms during
the 1140s. In many cases these were wealthy refugees
that repaid their new neighbors generosity by
investing money and effort back into the local
economy. Consequently the world is one of the most
integrated in the entire Regency. Rubrak is primarily
agricultural, exporting produce to Pretoria and Urnas.
A local plant known as the Spurjack yields a fibrous
sheathing that is very similar in nature and
durability to leather, and is a primary export.
Spurjack is much more supple, and can be sown or
woven, and it is a popular luxury item and clothing
article on several mid-tech worlds in the subsector.
