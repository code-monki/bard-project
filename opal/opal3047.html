 <B>Imperial Era</B><BR>
Barron was a small, non-industrial vacuum world with a population of 90,000 divided into eight separate and distinct nations. Barron was the site of Imperial Naval and Scout Bases. Barron was the homebase of the 572nd Cruiser Squadron (Subsector Reserve Fleet) and the 4,503rd Tanker Squadron (Subsector Reserve Fleet).
<P>
<B>Rebellion / Hard Times</B><BR>
Barron faired poorly during the opening years of the rebellion, a significant Solomani force consisting for several cruiser squadrons and a long range strike batron attacked the imperial fleet elements at Barrons naval base. The resulting battle resulted in the destruction of the imperial cruiser squadron and most of the tanker squadron. A few remaining tankers managed to flee into the Rusco subsector and linked up with the subsector fleets there (which were supported by Margaret's forces). A small escort flotilla escaped into the subsector and eventually allied with the pro Imperial Ral Ranta forces in the Hinterworlds. They spent most of the rest of the war raiding Solomani controlled worlds along the trailing frontier of the sector.
<P>
The battle resulted in the destruction of the naval base as well as most of the habitation domes of the surrounding cities of Semmel and Louzen, approximately 25,000 people died in this bombardment. The world was occupied by a under strength brigade of Solomani marines. These were replaced late in 1119 by a brigade worth of colonial troops from the alpha crucis. Unfortunately this brigade was made up of battalions from five separate worlds.
<P>
By the onset of hard times (1124) the subsector was effectively out of touch with the Solomani Confederation and the Solomani brigade had lost whatever semblance of co-ordinated control it had. Each battalion had taken control of 1 or more native cities and squabbled amongst themselves. This squabbling, coupled with the extensive damage to the planets infrastructure caused by the initial battle resulted in a plunge in local technology from TL=8 to TL=5. About this time the last of the operational spaceships failed.
<P>
By 1126, local technology had dropped further to TL3/4 and both the natives and occupying troops were having problems maintaining the cities life support systems. It was at this time that merchants from Torrel entered the system. After stripping the scout base of equipment and remaining vessels, they approached the various city councils (made up of the battalion senior officiers) and offered limited trade. Torrel provided life support equipment and electronics, while Barron provided salvage, and a cheap labour pool. With Torrels help, the technology level stabalised at TL=4 and was even starting to approach TL=5.

<B>Collapse</B><BR>
The virus entered the Torrel cluster via Barron, a detached duty scout ship entered the system from coreward. The ship was dead from virus, but several minor systems were infected with "viral eggs". The ship was salvaged by a cutter operating from barron, and the canabalised parts were sent to Torrel, dooming that world. About 2-3 weeks later, the virus exploded onto the world from the salvage fleet (2 cutters and a shuttle). Fortunately a TL4/5 world had few computer systems to be infected, althought the scout base / salvage centre was heavily affected. However, with the fall of Torrel no more spares were forth-coming. As parts grew scarce, the Solomani battalions fought a final futile war. After 6 months over 75% of the remaining population was dead and what was left of the infrastructure was destroyed and the planet had dropped to TL=2. The remainder of the population slowly perished over the next 5 years as the integrity of the domes failed, and the food ran out. Towards the end, certain groups had even resorted to cannabalism.
<P>
<B>New Era</B><BR>
Barron is a desolate barren world with no populations and little or no salvage. There is currently no active viral presence in the Barron system.
