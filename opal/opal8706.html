The namesake capitol of Deneb sector orbits its
blazing AIa primary from a distance of over 100 AUs
away, giving the longest orbit on record for any
former Imperial or current Regency world. Deneb itself
would normally have been a cold, rocky cored outer
zone world, but the high amount of radiation recieved
raises its surface temperature enough to support
primitive life. Given the star's short potential
lifespan, that is the most it can hope to evolve. The
world is geothermally dead, consisting of seas formed
out of extensive former ice sheets and huge plateaus
of black or blue gray meteoric rock. as it possesses a
rotational period of only 13 hours, high winds and
gales originating over dry land create ferocious
seastorms that can last 2-3 days.
<P>
Deneb was one of the first major worlds settled in the
early years of the Third Imperium, in the year 7.
Hostile Vargr to coreward forced the Imperials to
concentrate their interests along the curve of the
Great Rift; Deneb fell naturally along this route, and
the concentration of trade and communication routes
here made it the "Gateway to the Claw." Growth of the
world was rapid, attaining a population of more than
forty million is less than a century. By the 300s it
had a population of almost one billion, and was a
growing industrial power as well as a dominant trade
center. It was declared a sector capitol in 415.
<P>
During the first three centuries of its settlement,
various planetary trading consortiums vied for
control. After a bloody civil war in the 240s, the
increasingly disenchanted population turned to the
soothing ministrations of an obscure Gnostic religion
called To Will One Thing. Preaching unity and
compassion, the ministers of the church rallied
citizens dispossessed by the unending wars and
intrigue, and built a power base to wage holy war
against the corrupt and indifferent factions. In 313
the most powerful faction adopted the Willies as their
official faith, and by the middle of the century the
world was unified under an ecclesiastical
administration combining both religious and secular
components.
<P>
Because their faith recognises that not all people may
want to be taken into its fold, and understanding that
religious hegemony might actually create more harm
than good in the long run, the church hiearchy and its
faithful are highly accepting and encouraging of
offworld immigrants. Indeed only about half of the
population actually are of the 'One', and half of them
are apostates or syncretists who merge and mix parts
of the theology with offworld beliefs or values in a
way acceptable to the liberal minded clergy. The
remainder of the population is equally divided between
a dirtside culture known as the "Pollys" that live in
the larger cities that surround the worlds dozen or so
major starports, and the "Starmen" that live in the
massive collection of habitats that orbit Deneb
overhead, or lie in their own solar orbits.
<P>
Startown consists of about a hundred different manmade
or hollowed asteroidal colonies ranging in size of up
to 100 miles. Other than acknowledging the sovereignty
of the religious government, each of Startown's habs
are independent of each other with no intermediate
government controlling them. For the most part they
are aloof to conditions on the surface, as they are
more advanced technologically (TL-15 with increasing
16), and are generally self sufficient thanks to trade
with the wider Regency. The colonies are patrolled by
Deneb Planetary Navy vessels who ensure they remain
within the fold and continue to pay tax revenue to the
Ecclesiastical Council. The old age of some of these
habitats (see MTJ 2) is a cause of concern, and the
expense for replacing or maintaining them can only be
footed by the planetary government.
<P>
The Pollys refer to both the major Startowns and their
inhabitants. Like the Starmen, their technological
level is superior, and it includes Regency munition
plants and low orbit shipyards known as the Cristobal
Complex. These cities are enormous, largely because
they are confined to relatively small parcels of land
compared to the Marchlands and Cloisters. Most are
built underground, but still possess soaring
megastructures for commercial and industrial purposes.
The Pollys are the primary business class, but are
forbidden to organise any competing government
structure, though strong commercial and family ties
bind them together more cohesively than their orbital
neighbors. In antebellum times they were patrolled by
mercenaries hired by the Ecclesiastical Council; since
the Collapse these have been replaced by patrols of
the Flower of the One, the paramilitary arm of the To
Will One Thing faith.
<P>
The Marchlands are regions that lead up to the
Cloisters, and are primarily True Believers and
Apostates in population. These areas are rural, with
some small cities, where food is raised for
consumption in the Pollys and Cloisters. These
communities are highly insular and do not tolerate
strangers. Most are policed by militias under the
strict oversight of the Flower of the One. Agriculture
is genetically grown grain, hothouse vegetables and
fruit, and stem cell or Gene Vat horticulture.
<P>
The Cloisters resemble the Pollys in construction,
though generally they are much more extensive in area,
and have fewer subterranean warrens. Only True
Believers, or the Heart of the One as they prefer to
call themselves, are permitted residency in these
areas. Because of their theology, education levels for
these people are generally lower, with administrative
and technical careers confined to those individuals
raised within the core theology of the One. Local
police supplement by the Flower of the One enforce
strict observance of morality and civil codes at all
times here, with work teams of convicted minor
offenders everpresent in cleanup or construction work.
