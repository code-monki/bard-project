Bangwe's entire population lives on a single small
chain of islands near the downport. The starport
itself is a highly informal affair:</b> a group of beacons
ringing a shallow lagoon, with ships making a "soft"
landing in the water. The locals subsist on fishing
and handicrafts, and are quite content with their lot.
In antebellum times the world attracted sportsmen from
across Deneb, and locals make additional income by
hiring themsleves out to visiting RQS crews as guides
and outfitters. Handmade, wooden catamarans and
outriggers are the most popular form of transport, and
some of these are exported to worlds safeside for
exorbitant prices.
<P>
Bangwe is one of three worlds chosen as wildside trade
terminals, and negotiations are underway to expand the
starport into a full facility for trade and
colonisation. The locals are reluctant to fully open
up their world to contact, and are reportedly driving
a hard bargain, in the form of higher recompense from
the Regency government, before they will consent to
any kind of widescale development.
