  In 1192 <a href="opal3038.html">Osmosis</A>. set up this colony to support the Hiver Staging Base.  Before then, the Hive Federation had provided its own support crews, but they wanted to move these personnel deeper into the Old Expanses towards the Reformation Coalition.  A few thousand people emigrated with assistance from the Federation.  They set up a government identical to the one on the homeworld.  It is independent from Osmosis, but the two planets work closely together.  They are almost always in agreement on major issues.  Almost the entire planet is focused on the Hiver Base, people either work at the base or work at industries that support the workers at the base.
