Serendip was settled by the crew and remaining
passengers of the ESA long range colony ship <I>C-Jammer</I>
in the year 87 (Imperial calendar).  The colonisation
of an asteroid belt is a brave endeavor in the best of
times, the Serendips did it with TL 10 equipment and
no assistance from any other world. Several planetoids
were hollowed out, their metals refined and converted
into spin gravity habitats, and their interiors
converted into agriculture. Water and oxygen were
harvested from the systems Oort Cloud, and electrical
power was provided by massive solar power stations
placed at strategic locations in the inner system.
When the system was contacted by the misjumped
Imperial Strike Cruiser <I>Eldorado</I> during the Third
Frontier War, the system was flourishing.
<P>
Because of the enormous energy required to prosper in
an otherwise inhospitable system, a strong communal
culture had to develop, along with an advanced
entrepenurial streak. Seredips are loud, brash and
opinionated; they are given to outrageous behavior and
love to gamble and undertake challenges.  The local
government is a technocratic assemblage of autonomous
communities, private corporate enclaves and a few
communes of fringe dwellers and eccentrics. Few large
communities exist, and the population is scattered
over hundreds if not thousands of different asteroids.
In antebellum times the Belt was heavily
industrialised, and exported starships to the other
Islands. The system government is primarily a loose
parliamentary assemblage of the various communities,
though the tendency for individual Serendips to strike
out on their own and create new communities and
factions makes the government rather anarchic at
times. The seat of government is still located on the
<I>C-Jammer</I>, which has been preserved as a museum and
cultural center.
<P>
The demand for goods from other more habitable worlds
formed the basis of Serendip attempts at acquiring an
empire, and the government was nakedly expansionistic.
The Islands War started when Serendip forces attempted
to support a coup on Topas, which led to Neubayern
intervention. Serendip forces single-handedly knocked
Esperanza out of the war, but bogged down on
battlefronts against Neubayern, New Home and New
Colchis. Fighting against the last was especially
bitter, in spite of linguistic relationships, and the
two sides sparred incessantly over several contested
worlds. The large perimeter of the belt proved
indefensible against determined New Colchis strike
forces during the latter days of the war, and heavy
damage was inflicted upon industry and food production
sites.  In conjunction with Joyeuse, Serendip forces
meted bloody revenge upon New Colchis, but were compelled to
withdraw most of their forces and concentrate upon
reconstruction.
<P>
Serendip Belt is strongly Pro-Regency; the provision
of food aid and reconstruction money has arrested the
slide into oblivion, and has opened up contact with
Regency-side corps and investors. The government has
sold mining concessions to several companies,
including Sternmetal and LSP, and has used the
revenues to slowly rebuild its decimated food
production. It was the Serendip government that
initiated the Four-Power negotiations with Neubayern,
Sansterre and Amondiage; the government hopes to sell
new TL-12 starships to the other three in return for
needed foodstuffs, and build up trade as a means of
securing peace in the region.  Negotiations with
Neubayern over a mutual disengagement on Topas have
been slow and halting, however.
