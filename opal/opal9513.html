  <P>
Wonstar was settled around 650 by one of two groups of
colonists intent upon putting the Imperial mainstream
as far behind them as possible. They desired for a
simpler life freed from the rigid control and
constrained horizons of industrial and urban society,
a life of getting back to the land and working it for
personal and communal betterment. One group made its
way to Wonstar, and the other settled on Karin.  Both
experienced similar results, as their "live free or
die" ideology prompted them to put aside "confining"
concepts such as the rule of law and the role of the
courts in favor for ole fashioned frontier violence.
Karin actually degenerated into anarchy, prompting the
Imperial Navy to occupy and administer the world to
protect the naval base and retain Imperial control,
and maybe prevent the violence.
 <P>
Wonstar was equally contentious, the result of bloody
fueds between rival families that controlled much of
the worlds economic base.  Low law levels and no
enforcement against smugglers created an unimpeded
flow of arms to local militias.  Despite the nominal
unity of the government, power flowed from the gun
barrel, and most disputes were settled with violence
rather than through negotiation or the courtroom.  The
planet has an effective represenative Assembly, which
maintains order despite frequent gunplay.  What laws
that do exist, and are enforced by the world police
and military, exist to limit and ritualise violent
confrontation.
 <P>
The world's code duello isn't actually a formal
duelling code so much as a list of rules of
engagement. Ambushes, assasinations and other
underhanded tactics are permitted, as long as
collateral damage is limited. Fighting in cities is
allowed under extraordinary circumstances. Engagements
are permitted only in certain locales, under a limited
duration, with clear signals for the declaration of
victory or the acceptance of defeat.  The level of
weaponry allowed to the local militias were never to
exceed the firepower of the world military, an
enforcement backed by the local Imperial/Regency
Marine contingent.
 <P>
The locals violent tendencies led to the world's
former Amber rating, which was removed after the
Regency was convinced that they weren't hurting anyone
besides themselves.  While most of the population, as
on <A href="opal9509.html">Emape</A>, goes armed in public, most guns are simply
for decoration purposes rather than actual self
defense. The locals do not abide random violence, and
people without any dispute to prosecute that violate
this peace quickly find themselves transported to work
camps as punishment.
 <P>
The world is still like the wild west, and its
gunslingers have been supplemented by carpetbaggers
taking advantage of the lax laws for their own
schemes. The world is a center of a number of offshore
enterprises, again like Emape. Unlike their
counterparts, however, the violent ends that many
would be cheats and scoundrels often come to on this
world has a way of deterring egregious fraud and
larceny.
