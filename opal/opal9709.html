Acadie was one of the first colonies to be settled by
one of the original three worlds, in this case by
Amondiage with the newly constructed Asterix. Acadie's
local flora is largely inedible to humans, and hostile
to offworld strains. The early colonists genetically
adapted their livestock to be able to ingest selected
local species, and be able to plant friendlier
terrestrial grain and vegetables in fields cleared by
these grazers.  The livestock proved so successful
that animal husbandry proved more profitable than
horticulture, and still makes up a large portion of
the local economy.
<P>
After Amondiage acquired jump drive technology, it
used its military and economic power to annex Acadie
in 1033. Mining surveys discovered large deposits of
iron, manganese and cobalt, among other metals, and
mining became the primary revenue source.  The locals
were disinterested in politics, a consequence of their
far-flung settlements, and they were mostly content
with Amondiage and Tokapi's rule.  During the Islands
War, New Home and Sansterre glassed over the local
starport, and briefly disrupted Amondiage's control
over the world, but otherwise were little interested
in staking a colonial claim of their own in the face
of continued resistance.  Acadie is of fairly low
strategic importance to anyone nowadays, and it now
attracts tourists and offduty RQS personnel attracted
to its backwater obscurity.
