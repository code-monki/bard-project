Ektron was one of the original Darrian cluster worlds
settled by the pre-Maghiz Darrians.  It is
conveniently located near the end of one spur of the
Spinward Main, and within close proximity to the
homeworld.  This proximity nearly spelled the world's
doom, when the EMP wave from Tanis swept through a few
years after the Maghiz. Most of the colonists were
living in domed cities whose electronics and systems
were vulnerable to EM disruption, and about a quarter
of the population perished when those systems failed.
<P>
The stranded survivors eked out an existence on their
harsh world.  The previous bureaucratic government was
supplanted by a coalition of agricultural oligarchs
whose monopoly on power was assured by the difficulty
of growing food on Ektron.  Under these landlords, the
population lived in a miserable existence of
semi-slavery, as agriculture on the world was
extremely labor-intensive.  The population began to go
into further decline due to overwork, brutality and
starvation, and by the time that Mire recontacted
them, the population numbered less than fifteen
percent of the pre-Maghiz level.
<P>
The new Confederation government outlawed slavery,
emancipating the local population.  New colonists were
settled on the world to prevent recidivism, but an
alternate form of income was necessary to preserve the
status quo and support the world.  The conversion from
subsistence farming to profitable plantation cultures
were complicated by Ektron's dry, thin air, preventing
the use of offworld crops. Botanists and planters
scoured the backcountry for suitable native plants
instead.  A number of crops were developed, but the
salvation of the world came from an unlikely source, a
plant called Ektron or Effervescent Tea.
<P>
Ektron Tea is an unassuming shade-loving shrub with
one unusual feature: the leaves, in addition to
yielding a powerful and tasty caffienated beverage,
naturally store CO<sub>2</Sub>.  When the leaves are carefully
processed and packaged, this CO<sub>2</Sub> can remain until it
is released by immersion in hot or cold water,
creating a wonderful carbonated drink.  (No doubt the
Brits are recoiling while they read this.
 But there's no accounting for taste in the far
future.)
<P>
Most Ektron Tea was sold to the local Darrian market,
where it was an enjoyable counterpoint to the usual
serious diet of the average citizenry.  The Third
Imperium was slow in discovering this delicacy, until
Makhiduran began importing it into the rest of the
Marches after the Third Frontier War. The drink has
developed a significant reputation in the
Confederation, often being used as a homeopathic cure
for colds, allergies and hangovers.  Since the 1150s
the drink has become affordable enough, thanks to
expanded cultivation, for average Regency citizens to
purchase and enjoy.  The drink is marketed by several
beverage companies under various distinctive brand
names, including Vesuvius ("Vulcan Tea"), Akiracha
("ChaCha Brew") and Shumikkir-Makhiduran
("Effervesia", which comes in flavors like lemon and
strawberry).
