<h3>Darrian Subsector</h3> Some of this information has
already been included in my individual world writeups.
But for completion they have been repeated here.
<P>
<B>Population (1117/1202):</B> 15.2/39.3 Billion
<BR><B>Industrial Worlds:</B> 3
<BR><B>Mean Tech Level(1117/1202):</B> 11.6/13.6

<h4>Uniqua      </h4>      <B>1117:</B> E62556B-4
      <BR><B>1202:</B> E62557B-4         GA/**<P>

A former colony of Garoo that had been resubjugated by
its mother world in 1119. The Garoo War brought
Darrian invasion forces that partially liberated the
planet. The world is divided between Garooian, Darrian
and independent factions.

<h4>886-945     </h4>      <B>1117:</B> D833000-3
       <BR><B>1202:</B> D833100-3         GA<P>

Former surveillance base for the Garoo Republic. Now a
joint facility operated by several agencies of the
Regency and Non-Aligned worlds. 886-945 is a gas giant
moon, and the base monitors refuelling traffic at this
strategic juncture.

<h4>Nonym       </h4>      <B>1117:</B> C233898-A
       <BR><B>1202:</B> B23385A-C         GA<P>

Nonym was originally settled by the Pre-Maghiz
Darrians. Since that ancient disaster, the local
government had preferred its independence, even though
the civilian populace clearly indicated a desire for
anschluss. Sword World aggression compelled the
government to accept a Darrian military base after the
Fourth Frontier War, despite the percieved blow to its
sovereignty. After the decisive victory over the Sword
Worlders following the Fifth War, the planetary
government tried to expell the garrison. The Sword
World government responded by sending a Special Branch
Star Trigger detachment to the system. A popular
rebellion broke out, and the government was ousted in
favor of a Pro-Daryen administration in 1119. The
world was annexed, over Sword World protests, by the
Confederation in 1121.

<h4>Laberv      </h4>      <B>1117:</B> B354443-7
       <BR><B>1202:</B> B354525-8         GA<P>

Laberv was dominated by several criminal factions in
the antebellum period. Gang harrassment was so
constant that honest citizens fled into the outback.
After the Collapse, the Confederacy ruthlessly purged
the world of these mafias, and instituted a new
interactive democratic government to keep track of any
would be recidivists.

<h4>Engrange    </h4>      <B>1117:</B> C554769-8
       <BR><B>1202:</B> C554794-A         CD<P>

Engrange recieved its independence in 1124.

<h4>Kardin      </h4>      <B>1117:</B> E453123-6
       <BR><B>1202:</B> E453203-7         **<P>

This otherwise worthless world was discovered to
contain Ancient ruins. The 1117 government was
actually a small research team from the Daryen
University of Zlodh. The expedition finished its work
in 1126, and conceded the world to various independent
researchers and scavengers.

<h4>Cunnonic    </h4>      <B>1117:</B> E65767A-3
      <BR><B>1202:</B> C657758-8         CD<P>

Cunnonic has violent weather and ferocious wildlife,
paired challenges that overwhelmed the original
Darrian colonists. The colonists broke apart under the
strain into several competing factions, though being
Darrians military conflict was eschewed in favor of
debate. The world's proximity to the Sword Worlds
prevented wider intervention by the Confederation
government. The Civil War period saw several larger
nations reunify by their own efforts, and a modest
bootstrap operation started. Since the Collapse the
world's factions have completely reunified, and the
world has become a productive agricultural source
world. A large part of its income comes through the
commerce flowing through the "Four Corners" region
from the Regency Sword Worlds.

<h4>Debarre     </h4>      <B>1117:</B> B854123-9
(0830)      <BR><B>1202:</B> B854564-7         CD<P>
<P>
The hunters and outfitters on Debarre were supplanted
by a Regency colonisation effort in the 1130s.
<P>
<h3>Sword Worlds Subsector</h3> At the dawn of the Regency,
optimists compared the nascent state to a "vast mosaic
of different cultures, that nevertheless are cemented
together for the benefit of all." Since then, cynics
have seized upon the idea of a "mosaic, which is an
artform made out of broken glass or stones, sometimes
with sharp or jagged edges."  The Sword Worlds
Occupation was an exercise in "it seemed like a good
idea at the time" category, that has become an
unintended act of imperial aggression that much vexes
the Regency, and has often undermined its the
integrity of its actions and been a source of national
doubt and introspection.
<P>

Thanks to the occupation, the already brittle Sword
Worlds has fragmented to an even greater degree. The
intermixing of Imperial and Sword World cultures and
communities, and the different levels of accomodation
between them, has created sharp and jagged corners in
the region. Contrary to popular reports, not all of
the Sword Worlds and their peoples have resisted or
continue to resist the imposition of Regency
sovereignty. Some worlds, such as those that are a
part of the so called "Vilis Covenant" and some of the
former Border Worlds like Tyrfing and Beater, have
become assimilated into the Regency mainstream to an
irrevocable degree.  But then there are worlds like
Sacnoth, Joyeuse and Hofud, which are the main centers
of violent resistance.  And inbetween these two
extremes are worlds like Gram and Sting.  No
resolution of this situation is in sight, and
paradoxically even a Regency withdrawal would result
in a bloodbath between native Sword Worlders on
different worlds.
<P>
<B>Population (1117/1202):</B> 34.8/64.5 Billion
<BR><B>Industrial Worlds:</B> 3
<BR><B>Mean Tech Level(1117/1202):</B> 9.2/12.8
<BR><B>Senate Contingent:</B> 134

<h4>Hrunting    </h4>      <B>1117:</B> B463747-9
      <BR><B>1202:</B> A463756-A         GA/VC

Hrunting was an important Sword World military base
during the latter Frontier Wars. One of the first
worlds to sign the "Vilis Covenant" that opened up its
markets and communities via the facilitation of
Vilis/Vilis. Anti-Regency violence was rare, and is now
nonexistent.  The Regency/Sword Worlder population has
been well integrated for about fifty years.

<h4>Tizon       </h4>      <B>1117:</B> B386887-A
       <BR><B>1202:</B> A386885-B         GA/VC<P>

This mineral rich world is strongly Pro-Regency. Tizon
has a significant military and a strong martial
tradition. Under the advice of the Vilisian
government, the Regency stationed a number of Tizonian
military units on the Frontier. This tacit recognition
of their warlike nature, and years of (sometimes
foolhardy) valor against Vampire Fleets and surviving
Vargr Corsairs has cemented its loyalty to the
Regency. Tizonian immigrants from the rest of the
Regency are generally ex-military or reservists.  The
resulting mixed society is perhaps one of the
strangest on record anywhere in Charted Space.

<h4>Flammarion  </h4>      <B>1117:</B> A625514-B
      <BR><B>1202:</B> A625634-D         RR<P>

For centuries this world was the property of Ling
Standard Products. The Regency, and other corps,
wanted the company to open up the world to outside
development. It was only by a vote of the company's
shareholders in a "referendum" in 1160 that other
companies and offworld commercial groups were allowed
access. The current government is an oligarchy of
several local corporate executives.

<h4>Colada      </h4>      <B>1117:</B> B364685-B
     <BR><B>1202:</B> B36466A-B         GA<P>

Colada had a thriving criminal underground, one
inflamed by the Regency invasion of 1132. The Regency
crackdown only further antagonised the locals, and a
low level insurgency has been ongoing for decades.
Coladans are unusually contradictory in their
attitudes towards the Regency and its citizens; for
while they are given to waging guerilla war on their
"occupiers", Coladan merchants are very active across
the Regency.

<h4>Mjolnir     </h4>      <B>1117:</B> B530544-A
 <BR><B>1202:</B> B530566-B         GA/VC<P>

Mjolnir is occupied by Hessian units from Vilis. This
is the only world to be conquered and directly
occupied by forces from a Regency member world.
Vilisian units attacked Mjolnir in retaliation for
Landgrab attacks from that world in 1132, without
authorisation from the Regency military command
structure. The Vilisians made a clean sweep of the
puny local military, and quickly made their presence
known. Despite the blatant imperialism of their
actions, the Vilisians mixture of Sword World
prickliness and Imperial civility endeared them to the
Mjolnirians, and the Regency has been content to leave
the situation as it is.

<h4>Joyeuse     </h4>      <B>1117:</B> B464778-A
       <BR><B>1202:</B> B47476A-A         GA<P>

During the Regency occupation of the world in 1132,
fanatical elements of the local military barricaded
themselves in the local military base, which is
located on the worlds large moon.  During one exchange
of fire between attacking Naval vessels and the base,
a massive stockpile of nuclear weapons was either
deliberately detonated (according to the Regency) by
the base personnel, or deliberately targeted
(according to the Sword Worlders) by the Navy. The
explosion destroyed a good portion of the base, and
showered Joyeuse with debris. The dust from the
detonation filled the upper atmosphere, blocking
sunlight and causing surface temperatures to fall
dramatically.  Regency occupation forces are limited
to heavily fortified firebases in orbit and the
surface, as the countryside is rife with factionalised
militias.

<h4>Enos        </h4>      <B>1117:</B> E25059B-4
      <BR><B>1202:</B> C2506AA-7         CD<P>

Enos ineffective government was supplanted in 1133 by
a junta led by the younger brother of the infamous
Baron Van Kreden of Gungnir. The world has become a
training ground for Sword Worlds guerillas, and
communities of fanatical extremists dot the outback.
In many cases these communities fight one another.

<h4>Gungnir     </h4>      <B>1117:</B> B444779-8
       <BR><B>1202:</B> B444788-9         GA/VC<P>

The reunion between parent and child was bittersweet
for Gungnir and Vilis. For all of Vilis' problems, it
had clearly eclipsed its motherworld in power and
progress. The occupation of this world was further
complicated by its insane government processes, and
being the homeland of the infamous Baron Van Kreden.
As with Tizon, however, many Gungnirians have served
on the Frontier for the Regency against Virus,
diverting much of the worlds pent up agression.
Economic development, and Vilis' counsel of patience
has gone a long way in calming this wild world, and
building up its loyalty to the Regency. Anti-Regency
violence remains a problem, though mostly as a side
effect of internal feuding.

<h4>Gram        </h4>      <B>1117:</B> A895957-B
     <BR><B>1202:</B> A895957-C         GA<P>

Gram has been largely ambivalent towards the Regency.
The world's lower classes had been miserable under
Sword World rule, and trade with the Regency has
brought them a measure of prosperity. Unlike most
other violence stricken Sword Worlds, resistance to
occupation has not come from the grassroots, as on
Sacnoth, but from disaffected parts of the upper and
middle classes, largely students and intellectuals.
Gram's government is strongly divided between pro and
anti-Regency factions, and intercommunal fighting has
been a problem.

<h4>Sacnoth     </h4>      <B>1117:</B> B775956-C
      <BR><B>1202:</B> B775A69-D         GA<P>

Sacnoth had been a severely xenophobic world, even for
a Sword World.  Visitors to the world were confined to
a large reservation around the Downport, and were not
permitted to pass beyond its periphery. The Regency
unwisely and cavalierly did away with this arrangement
after the Landgrab, and the world has been rent with
intercommunal violence ever since.  Sacnoth had been
severly factionalised to begin with, and the Regency's
brazen actions (at least in their view) and
immigration set off a severe backlash. Several large
regions are unsafe even for the Regency military to
visit, and are interdicted.

<h4>Dyrnwyn     </h4>      <B>1117:</B> B958412-A
     <BR><B>1202:</B> B958418-B         Ab<P>

The development corp that owned Dyrnwyn has been too
accomodating to the Regency, at least according to
Sword World resistance. As with Durendal, there have
been violent attacks by offworld terrorist and
guerilla groups. The former Sword World community on
the world has been the target of several of these, and
it has thrown in its lot with it occupiers.

<h4>Durendal    </h4>      <B>1117:</B> B687334-B
       <BR><B>1202:</B> B687647-C         Ab/CD<P>

Durendal was originally owned by high ranking members
of Sacnoth's government. Large estates divided the
world, and the population were mostly domestics
employed in their upkeep. With the abolition of
Sacnoth's government after the Landgrab, Durendal no
onger had a raison de etre, and the world was opened
up to settlement. While nearly the entire population
is of Imperial descent, the precedent of an entire
former Sword World being taken over in this fashion
has been inflammatory, and some of the wildest and
most desperate attacks have been attempted by various
terrorist factions on Sacnoth. The Amber Zone was
instituted after several attempts to ram merchant
ships into the world's communities.

<h4>Hofud       </h4>      <B>1117:</B> B666653-A
       <BR><B>1202:</B> B666655-B         GA<P>

Hofud has long been a thorn to the Third Imperium and
the Regency. The scattered agricultural communities
shelter myriad resistance groups, so much so that
Regency soldiers joke if they were to withdraw the
world would suffer from disastrous unemployment. Most
of these groups are lightly armed, and their attacks
on the Regency troops are more irritating than
harmful.

<h4>Sting       </h4>      <B>1117:</B> B645896-A
       <BR><B>1202:</B> B645887-B         GA<P>

Sting had been the former capitol of the old Border
Worlds.  Sting is a study in contrasts; severe
divisions exist at every level of its society over
basic issues, most notably the Regency Occupation. The
world changes its mind so frequently, and yet so
indecisively, that it has been nicknamed "ole
wishy-washy."  Violence is quite rare, though debates
between the different factions have undermined
consensus and rendered the old government ineffective.
The new government has been marginally better at
effecting change.

<h4>Halifax     </h4>      <B>1117:</B> E655000-7
       <BR><B>1202:</B> C655557-A         CD<P>

Formerly known as Steel. World colonised by the
conservative Protocols of Halifax faction of the "To
Will One Thing" religion. Originally Halifax and
Wisconsin were to be settled by the same group, but as
is often the case with Vargr dominated groups, a
schism developed over seemingly minor ideological
matters, and the two factions are know bitterly
opposed to each other.

<h4>Wisconsin   </h4>      <B>1117:</B> E568000-7
    <BR><B>1202:</B> C565645-A         CD<P>

Formerly known as Mithril. Colonised by the Wisconsin
Synod faction of the "To Will One Thing" religion.
Wisconsin has a highly eccentric orbit around its
dwarf star primary, and has extended periods of both
cold and hot. Since the world's colonisation in the
1140s, the world has started its long approach towards
perhelion, and the climate has slowly warmed up.
<P>
<h3>Five Sisters Subsector</h3> The "Wild West" of the
Regency; also known as the "Rand". FS is the terminus
for trade from the rest of the Spinward States to
spinward and rimward (known IMTU as the "Mortal
Coil"). Originally known as District 267, the
subsector's development lagged as a result of tensions
with the Zhodani, and has only begun to open up since
the Collapse. Much of its immigration has been
undertaken by back to nature groups, and entrepenuers
of varying character. Quarantine regulations for
extra-Regency trade is relaxed to permit greater
trade, but then has to pass through a number of
different quarantine posts in order to pass to the
Regency safe. The sizeable Senate contingent is
frequently cited by critics of Regency Senate
apportionment, for while FS has a population of barely
a billion, it has only fifteen fewer seats than Star
Lane subsector (with a population of 101 billion).

<P><B>Population (1117/1202):</B> 0.5 Billion/1.2 Billion
<BR><B>Industrial Worlds:</B> 1
<BR><B>Mean Tech Level (1117/1202):</B> 10.0/12.0
<BR><B>Senate Contingent:</B> 126

<h4>Emape       </h4>      <B>1117:</B> B564500-B
       <BR><B>1202:</B> A564622-B         GA<P>

Emape's wild, lawless culture was an early victim of
the RQS and its SecDets. The world is the main
interface port for trade from Foreven and Beyond, and
too vital to permit smugglers and pirates a foothold.

<h4>Raweh       </h4>      <B>1117:</B> B130300-B
       <BR><B>1202:</B> B130412-D         GA<P>

Raweh's small interface port is run by a private
company under contract to the RQS. Most of the
civilian population are adherents of the local "Church
of the Golden Sands."

<h4>Lothlorien  </h4>      <B>1117:</B> E687200-0
       <BR><B>1202:</B> C687643-B         CD<P>

The primitive human population of this world was
decimated by an unknown cause. The survivors were
assimilated into a new colony established by a Regency
ecological group.

<h4>Andor       </h4>      <B>1117:</B> C695735-8
      <BR><B>1202:</B> C6958X5-D         **<P>

This is merely a RISS reclassification.  Droyne
government was finally recognised by the Regency for
its uniformity. Andor remains interdicted for unknown
reasions.

<h4>Galadriel   </h4>      <B>1117:</B> E754401-8
       <BR><B>1202:</B> D754545-8         CD<P>

An indigenous, nomadic human culture of unknown orgin
existed (and still exists here). Known as the Trexen,
their numbers were supplemented after the Collapse by
another offshoot of the same group that colonised
Lothlorien and Prince Edward. Neither group has
assimilated into the other's lifestyle, though
relations between the two communities are excellent.

<h4>Candory     </h4>      <B>1117:</B> C593634-8
       <BR><B>1202:</B> C5937X5-E         **<P>

Same as Andor. Candory remains interdicted for unknown
reasons. The Regency government has never given an
explanation for this continued surveillance and
blockade. The old excuses, like Ancient sites (which
are now largely declassified) and "psionic
contamination" (remember the Psionic Reforms) can no
longer justify the interdiction.  Visitors to the two
Droyne worlds are permitted to land at the downport,
but are prevented from moving beyond its periphery.

<h4>Ucella      </h4>      <B>1117:</B> D574654-7
       <BR><B>1202:</B> D574554-8         GA<P>

This once pleasant world became party to massive
chemical plants owned by Ling Standard Products. The
local government was powerless to enforce basic
environmental laws, and the atmosphere grew heavy with
pollutants. A petition from the world government
reached Regent Norris in 1132, who decreed, as part of
the crackdown upon corporate illegality, that LSP
either clean up its act on Ucella, or face Regency
sanction. On the end, LSP withdrew its personnel and
shuttered the plants. The world is still recovering
from centuries of abuse.

<h4>Karin       </h4>      <B>1117:</B> A767768-C
       <BR><B>1202:</B> A767789-E         RR<P>

Karin had been placed under the control of the
Imperial Navy following a breakdown in civil order
during the 900s. The naval administration had finally
worn out its welcome by the time of the
Representational Reforms, and despite its heated
objections, was removed as governing authority in a
referendum.

<h4>Froin       </h4>      <B>1117:</B> C535225-9
      <BR><B>1202:</B> B535543-A         CD<P>

The main interface port into the Core/Spin corner of
the Trojan Reach. The world was previously the
exclusive property of Research Station Zeta, which has
been interdicted since the Collapse.

<h4>Ralhe       </h4>      <B>1117:</B> E224564-8
       <BR><B>1202:</B> D224575-9         **<P>

The population of this "colony" of Iderati (0732) felt
neglected and ignored by their masters. The world had
been deliberately left outside of the Regency by the
Duke of Iderati, who did not desire closer scrutiny of
his operations on the world by the new government. A
revolt created balkanisation, and the secessionist
elements petitioned for Regency membership.

<h4>Prince Edward</h4>      <B>1117:</B> E888421-7
       <BR><B>1202:</B> C888653-8         CD<P>

This world was "colonised" by the survivors of the
crash of the Izmir Corporation escort <I>Prince Edward</I>,
just a few scant years before Izmir moved to Darrian.
The world's culture and language are directly
descended from the ancient Solomani nation of Turkey.
The locals have been since assimilated by Regency
immigrants.

<h4>Retief</h4>      </h4>      <B>1117:</B> E100301-9
       <BR><B>1202:</B> D100453-A         **<P>

Retief had been a secret base for the Imperial
megacorp Hortalez et Cie. It is suspected that it was
established to free certain company operations from
the scrutiny of the Imperial government. Unfortunately
Hortalez was largely destroyed by the Collapse, and
the world and its base were sold to a number of
interested colonial groups in the 1132 Fire Sale.
