Milne is the pride of Harem subsector, a beautiful
garden world covered with a dense atmosphere that is
highly amenable to human habitation.  Although a bit
on the cool side, Milne quickly became the Consulate's
second capitol, capitalising on its close proximity to
the rest of the Avalar Corridor.  The world was one of
the first Chontdol systems settled in the 600s, and is
often considered to be the "empress of Avalar" by the
rest of the Consulate.
<P>
Because of its garden reputation, the world did not
develop much heavy industry.  Its main purpose was as
a showcase for the Consulate, and to house the
secondary functions of its government and bureaucracy.
Most land on the world was divided between the ruling
Venues, and the cities were mostly dependent upon
light industry and agriculture for economic survival.
Because of the heavy concentration of the upper
classes on the world, Milne was in many ways more
important than the capitol itself to the politics of
the Consulate. The world developed a reputation much
like that of a Prince Edward County, or Westchester,
or Dorsetshire.
<P>
In the wake of the Collapse, the Regency began to
pursue a new program of technological improvement for
its high population worlds. On many worlds, this
entailed economic hardship for workers that could not
adapt their skills and lifestyles to the advancing
technology.  In many cases large sections of the labor
force were rendered obsolete. Most of these workers
either faded into obscurity, or formed strong
resistance groups on some worlds in opposition to
change in the period of 1130-1155.  But the younger
and more enterprising "outcasts" emigrated to the tune
of 30-35 billion people to the Avalar Consulate or
Corellian League. Many of these were actually more
concerned with Virus than with economics, and were
fleeing worlds on the Deeprim border.
<P>
A very large percentage were permitted to settle on
Milne by the Avalar government.  This was mostly done
in deference to the Venues of other industrial worlds
opposed to the influx of Regency money and influence,
and to allow the Consulate government greater control
over the emigres. But in doing so, they allowed
unrestricted immigration to Milne, and the Regency
community swelled till it nearly became a majority
(47.1 percent of the population to be exact).  The
native Venues and their estates were eclipsed by a
rapid explosion of Regency corporate power in the
period of 1142-1166, and are now secondary to the new
industrial titans that now dominate the world.
<P>
Milne has slowly outstripped nearby <a href="opal9327.html">Tewupo</A> in
importance, and is the Consulate's largest banking
center, and second largest shipbuilder. The residue
from this development was invested in Avalar itself,
and the capitol's development into industrial power is
largely due to Milne and its corporate havens. Most
Regency companies that operate in the Consulate
maintain their HQs here instead of Avalar. Culturally
the world is closer to the Regency than Avalar, and
the Consulate has closely watched the world to see if
the consequences outweigh the benefits immigration has
brought.
<P>
Milne is dominated by the "Six Cities of Gold", huge
arcologies each dedicated to a different industry. The
local government is a coalition of represenative
unions centered on these cities. The local populace
has shown divided loyalties in the past between both
the Consulate and the Regency, but have carefully
balanced out the two.
