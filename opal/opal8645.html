Woaros was settled by humans during the latter days of
the 700s. In the cold, wet local environment a strain
of bacterial meningitis somehow crossed over into the
local ecology and mutated into a deadly new disease.
Known as Crackbone Neuraglia for its deadly brain
seizures, the new disease wiped out half of the
population in a matter of a few weeks in 813. When no
cure could be found, and with the world's population
dying out too rapidly to save, the Imperial Navy
interdicted the world to prevent the release of the
disease offworld.
<P>
That the Navy led the way to interdict the world
caused no small amount of conspiratorial speculation
during the antebellum period. Many speculated that the
disease was either developed by the military, or that
it wanted to convert it into a weapon. Documents
released since the Collapse indicate that the measure
was actually preventive; apparently the disease proved
too dangerous to effectively control.
<P>
The current population is mostly wandering nomads who
herd local grazers for their hides and meat. The local
climate is bitterly cold, with glaciation a problem
even in the temperate regions. Quarantine restrictions
prevent offworld contact of even an innocuous nature,
as most of the populace are non-symptomatic carriers
of the disease. and the local society quickly slid
into primitivism. Since the Collapse a warming trend
has enabled some permanent settlements to develop, and
the world's technology has increased to pre-industrial
levels.
