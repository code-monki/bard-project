A way station, unlike the old Imperial equivalent, is
a base that facilitates fleet communications, by
assisting naval couriers, and doesn't actually have
any repair or basing capabilities for line fleet

<B>Mowbrey  Subsector:</B>
<P>

Mowbrey subsector is seperated by a jump-3 gap known
as the  Mowbrey Rift. The spinward worlds are
politically associated with Anika subsector, and the
trailing worlds more with the worlds of Fessor
subsector. In the Post-Collapse period Regency money
and settlers came to open up new markets, but were
hampered by continued Zhodani interference and
isolationism. The subsector now possesses three
industrial worlds, two of which, Eronirabo(1817) and
Robebi(2320), have substantial exports to the Regency.
<P>
The 1117 Population of Mowbrey was 2.3 billion, and
the highest TL was B at Fonda (1815) and Ibrolelis
(2412). The 1200 population of Mowbrey was 4.4
billion, and the highest TL was D at Fonda.
<P>
The subsector is named after Jason Mowbrey, a
legendary Free Trader Captain and Independent
Explorer. In the year 355 (234 years before the first
frontier war) he was the first one to cross what is
known as The Mowbrey Rift. Five years later he
disappeared, and there are still numerous tales and
rumors about his fate.
