Vanejen was originally colonised by Vilani around 3600
years ago, the members of a particularly venturesome
colonial group. After being cut off by the Long Night,
the colony slid back into barbarism, and was not
recontacted by the Third Imperium (after interdiction)
until 980. Since then integration into the Imperial,
then Regency mainstream has been slow. Local
conditions have challenged traditional IISS/RISS world
classification systems, as the atmosphere and local
government are borderline systems that defy easy
categorisation. The world has prolonged cold spells,
which create considerable ice sheets even in temperate
waters. Originally the locals navigated around these
with locally produced cargo submersibles, but its
advancing tech level has permitted the replacement of
these with more advanced cargo and passenger
dirigibles that are more flexible in their use.

Vanejen is the site of Marches' infamous Research
Station Gamma.  One of several psionic research
facilities operated by the former Imperial government
despite its own laws prohibiting such research, Gamma
investigated the psionic abilities of various animal
and sentient species collected from around the
Imperium. Many of these were subjected to cruel
experiments, and Vanejen's own Chirper population was
the main source of raw material. The facility was
attacked and damaged by unknown terrorists in 1106,
but it wasn't until the Psionic Reforms that its
purpose and perfidy were revealed. Norris himself
shuttered the original facility, a submerged facility
located offshore the main northern continent, and its
resources and unindicted personnel were transferred to
a new facility in the outback, under new management
and stricter rules and guidelines.  The old Gamma
appears partially responsible for the decline in the
local Chirper population, and Droyne observers are
posted on the world to prevent further atrocities.
