  This world weathered the collapse well, and was a minor 
port of call for free traders in the subsector. When it was contacted 
by Strom in 1137, it was offered and accepted aid programs to help 
it's recovery. In 1143 it offered to become a Protectorate of Strom's 
in exchange for Home Rule. This was accepted, and Slider has become 
rich through the increased trade that has resulted. The planet is 
still run by the Slider Port Authority, but with increasing local 
input. The local traders have a reputation as the canniest in local 
space. Slider is also the location of the Pact Headquarters. Located 
in a massive geodesic dome carved out of a mountain overlooking the 
port, it is considered a wonder by the peoples of the pact, but the 
locals just refer to it as 'The Chrome Dome'. The exact reason for 
this appellation is unknown, as the dome has little metal fittings
on the exterior.
