Storm is the solitary free standing world in its
system. It possesses a thick fluidic atmosphere and
very rich deposits of metals. Pressures on the surface
reach up to 300 atmospheres, requiring special vacc
suits and shelters to survive on the pressure cooker
surface. And to top things off, the lower elevations
are whipped by hurricane force "currents" that can
tear most equipment apart. Despite this, an
experimental mining station has been constructed on a
high mountaintop. The facility is staffed by both
humans and Virushi (who can withstand fluidic
pressures rather well). Most mining is done in the
higher elevations by vacc suited workers, but lower
elevations can only be reached by specially equipped
robotic probes. Polticial problems on nearby Lilad
have sapped the facilities financial backing, and a
large number of staff have left for greener pastures.
