Isobel is an ice cored world with a highly eccentric
orbit.  The world has an orbital period of about eight
years around its giant M2II primary. When the world
approaches perhelion, gravitational and magnetic
friction created by the star and its smaller close
companion flexes the planetary crust, causing a
pressure release that allows the solid ice to become
liquid, and erupt as enormous geysers.
<P>
These geysers range from small "fountains" up to
massive "ice volcanos" that shoot at very high
velocities into the thin atmosphere, where the water
and rock ejecta freezes and returns to the surface as
massive ice boulders.  These "killer snowballs" can
range between sand grains and small spacecraft in
size, and the bombardment gives the world its Amber
rating. Isobel's dirtside settlements are built in
protected subterranean grottos, and ship traffic is
usually confined to the highport during the "flocking"
season.
<P>
Naturally this phenomenon attracts tourists, who
observe eruptions from the safety of orbital
observation stations or gravitic tour buses.  The
eruptions constantly resurface the surface with new
ice and snow, creating massive glaciers at the poles
and dramatic landscapes.  The more adventurous will
venture on to the surface for exploration in vehicles
or on skis, though this isn't recommended, and the
locals are not very forthcoming in rescuing waylaid
groups.
<P>
Since this tourism is seasonal, most of Isobels
population is supported by commerce through the port,
or in small mining operations on the surface. The
world is on the main trade route into Titan subsector,
and a fair amount of shipping uses the port for
servicing and refueling purposes.
<P>
Isobelian society is surprisingly militant, and the
world is home to several of the Consulates more
reputable mercenary organisations.  Most local
government and organisation is laid along military
lines, though as a one gun, one vote system
reminiscent of militia dominated societies.
