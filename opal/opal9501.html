<A NAME="APPEARANCE"><H3>PHYSICAL APPEARANCE</H3></A>
From orbit Hexos appears as a normal  world, it is
only when seen through high resolution imaging devices can one
see the rotting corpse of a world that is Hexos.   The extremely
thin atmosphere  does  not retain much heat, so the average
temperature hovers about 10 C. Most of the water on the
planet  is located in two large ice caps at each pole. Geothermal
vents keep small lakes liquid.  Primitive lichens and algae
live around these lakes, so far these are the only native forms
of life that have been found on the planet.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="HISTORY"><H3>HISTORY</H3></A>
History:  Hexos was settled in the year 631, by  waves of immigrants
from the Imperial core seeking a new life on the frontier.
The planet was an important station in the Xboat route.  The
Imperial Navy established a base on the moon of the closest gas
giant. The planet was fairly stable, the technological level was
almost stagnant rising from  seven to eight over two hundred
years.  This fit in with the personality of the population,  they
were quite laid back. <BR><BR>

        Not much changed until the Civil War. By 1117  the  Aslan
ihatei had made major inroads in the Trojan Reaches and were
starting to enter the Spinward Marches.  The naval base  was
upgraded and expanded. This provided a bit of an economic boom,
as more naval personal took shore leave,  and  civilian
contractors needed some place to spend their wages. Most citizens
thought that the boom was changing Hexos too much; too many new
people with new ways of doing things.  They also didn't understand
the Hexos way of doing things. On 338-1120 a large fleet
gathered  at Hexos, and launched a strike against  Aslan targets
at Craw/Glisten.  While the fleet was gone, a group
of thirty Aslan ships jumped into the  system. These were
mostly small ships, under 1000 tons displacement.  A few of these
ships attacked the Naval base, and engaged the  Naval  SDBs,
others split up and started a light orbital bombardment of the
planet.  Ships returning from an earlier raid into Aslan space,
jumped into the system and attempted to engage the raiders.
Seeing the returning ships, the Aslan jumped away. <BR><BR>

        By the next day thousands of people had come down with  a
deadly  disease.  By 343-1120 half the population was dead, most
casualties were in the capital city of Dione.  The  deaths were
not limited  to humans, livestock and Chirpers also died in huge
numbers.  On 019-1121 Imperial authorities announced to the TNS
that the last inhabitant had died.  Imperial investigations into
possible use of biological weapons by Aslan ihatei never reached
a definite conclusion, but the circumstantial evidence forced
most observers to reach that conclusion.  Dr Julia Kartinian, a
scientist investigating the disease was quoted as saying "Whatever
it is that's killing these people Aslan appear be immune." <BR><BR>

        Since 1121 the planet has been a wasteland. The Navy has
designated the planet a  War Grave and interdicted the planet.
The Navy placed a warning beacon in orbit and only occasionally
patrols the system.  The threat of still active biological warfare
agents is enough to scare off most looters. Recently several
clans of Aslan that reside in the Imperium have asked that they
be allowed to emigrate to Hexos.  These clans were not involved
in the destruction of Hexos, in fact they were not even involved
in the invasion of the Imperium, rather having settlements in
the Riftspan Reaches.  They  came  to the Regency after fleeing
the Virus.  Since then they have lived on crowded refugee worlds
in Troy.  They reason that they are not being productive citizens
of the Regency crammed in a refugee camp, and if they were
given Hexos, they could help rebuild the planet.  This has
stirred up a huge public outcry, especially on formerly  occupied
worlds.  Debate continues in the Regency Senate.	 <BR><BR>

<A NAME="SOCIETY"><H3>SOCIETY</H3></A>
Before the Civil War, the population of Hexos lived in
small domed cities.  Most of these cities were located around
geothermal vents. These provided a source of  liquid  water, and
heat.  Geothermal power generation provided a cheap source of
electricity.	   <BR><BR>

    Crops were grown in underground hydroponic tanks.  Livestock
were raised in huge factory farms, where animals were born, lived
and died all within a few feet.  There were several groups of animal
rights  activists  which  protested the conditions at these
farms, but most residents wanted meat, more than they wanted happy
animals. The government on Hexos was almost nonexistent, it
existed mostly to take care  of interplanetary issues, and to
maintain the common facilities, such as the starport, power
generation, and life support equipment.  A Planetary Council of  ten
individuals were elected every three years to oversee the
bureaucracy.  They made most routine  decisions, anything complex,
important  or even somewhat controversial was put to a
planetary referendum. These were conducted over the  planet  wide
computer net.  A week long period of discussion would be followed
by a vote. A simple majority decided all issues.  These
referendums were not that common, usually only one every few
months.<BR><BR>

        Hexos had a sizable Chirper population.  Unlike  most
worlds  where  Chirpers were second  class citizens, if even
citizens, the people of Hexos treated the Chirpers with respect and
dignity.  They had full voting rights, but few if any took advantage
of it.  Most of the chirpers worked at menial jobs such as
janitorial staff, and all around grunt labor.<BR><BR>

       The population had a laissez-faire attitude towards most
things.  People were free to do as they please, as long as no one
else was harmed. If someone was harmed, society would shun the
offending party,  until they made redress.  Extremely violent
crime was very rare, but did happen occasionally. When such an
unfortunate event occurred a group of citizens would find and
eliminate the diseased individual.	<BR><BR>
