Tisilli is the main interface world between the Aslan
and the bases of the 231st. While given exclusive
control of the worlds in this borderland, the Regency
must share patrolling of this region with the Hierate,
and the local "Clan" naval base is a joint facility
where most Hierate patrols begin their operations.
Tisilli was a very rich world in antebellum times, as
it was a rich source for heavy metals exported to the
Aslan, and the money from this trade was well invested
by the local population into terraformation projects,
local education and infrastructure. Blessed with
comfortable lives and nearly full employment, few
Tisillians abandoned the world when they were offered
passage by the Aslan or the Regency.  The world has
replaced its old Virus vulnerable computer systems
with new resistant ones of local manufacture and
design, and this has become a supplementary source of
income through exports to the Hierate.
