Amirante is the low tech misfit world. It is not an
intentional development, it is one of those worlds
that act as a dumping ground for groups and
individuals with nowhere else to go or prosper in the
mainstream of Imperial/Regency society. Amirante was
first settled in the 480s by a self styled
back-to-nature-sect who were actually pirates and
criminals operating in disquise. Despite a lack of
resources, and their own sociopathic tendencies, the
syndicate eventually turned respectable, and began
attracting other vagabonds from Deneb and the Marches
to their hidey-hole.
<P>
On Amirante the lack of of a working economy or a
cohesive culture is apparent. Every group that
previously came here is isolationist or xenophobic to
the extreme. The present bureaucratic government runs
a socialistic economy that provides enough
productivity to keep the air plants working and people
from starving. But to most visitors the world is a
large prison for interstellar rednecks and outcasts.
While violence is rare, the world simmers with
residual resentment. The population is gruff with
outsiders, and few travellers journey beyond the
starport perimeter.<P>

Most of the population lives in domes built out of
whatever materials they could salvage. The government
possesses imported TL 7 to 8 life support plants that
it leases to interested groups, along with warrantied
maintenance contracts.
