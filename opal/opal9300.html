Novoterre is a pleasant, Earthlike world located about
three parsecs from the Imperial/Regency border along
the Urnian Main.  Possessing almost no axial tilt, and
a long growing year thanks to its long orbit around
its F5V primary, the world should be one of the gems
of Foreven, a major trade and agricultural center. And
it would be, if human greed and folly didn't stalk its
progress.
 <P>
The worlds first human settlers were Solomani of mixed
French and Italian descent who settled the world
around -290.  Further waves of settlement continued
for another 100 years, in many cases subsequent surges
of more technologically advanced marauders attempting
to carve out petty empires.  By the time the Third
Imperium had been founded, the world had broken down
into anarchy, its potential spilled across the ground.
Its inhabitants regressed into Iron Age barbarism, and
all knowledge of its technological past forgotten.
IISS contact teams reached the world in 331, and the
world was interdicted to protect it from further
piracy.  In retrospect, the Imperium's patronage was
not motivated by humanitarian concerns so much as
economic and political ones. Surveys had indicated the
world's potential wealth, but its close proximity to
Zhodani controlled space ruled out major development.
In the aftermath of its period of wars, the world was
divided between several large empires that uneasily
coexisted with each other. Many of these nations still
had a memory of their technological past, and seemed
amenable to outside contact.
 <P>
Under the cover of its interdiction, the Imperium
posted "bootstrap" teams to these nations. These teams
advised the local potentates and assisted their
technological recovery, in exchange for exclusive
Imperial access to their mineral and agricultural
resources.  Leaders that did not cooperate with, or
actively opposed these advisors were assassinated,
overthrown, exiled or faced invasions by their
neighbors.  Naturally the Zhodani and their Avalar
allies were incensed at this meddling for political
and humanitarian reasons, and infiltrated their own
agents and material to anti-Imperial nations. This
manipulation led to the elevation of militant
factions, creating a severely regressive group of
nations intent upon conquest and domination.
 <P>
Eventually the enmities that were cultivated by these
outside sources took on a life of their own. Two major
power blocs emerged, the pro-Imperial Maelstrom League
and the independence minded Iridian Feoderate, who
waged globe spanning wars on their own initiative,
oftentimes to the detriment of their patrons' own
plans.  A local renaissance in basic sciences and
technological development led, accompanied and were
abetted by these conflicts.  Even though
Imperial-Zhodani hostility died down in the period
following the outbreak of the Imperial Civil War, it
had no measurable impact upon local dynasts and their
military brinkmanship.
 <P>
As hostilities escalated, and several nations acquired
nuclear technology, the Regency lifted the
interdiction and imposed its will upon the warring
nations. A large Regency naval base was constructed in
orbit to serve notice to the warring nations where the
ultimate arbitrage existed.  Tensions have simmered
down considerably since then, but the underlying
causes still remain, and petty espionage and small
brushfire wars continue to rage.
 <P>
The most significant nations of Novoterre are:
 <P>
<B> United Kingdom of Ferrond (Pop: 1,180,000,000):</B>
Largest and most powerful of Novoterre's nations.
Leader of the Iridian Feoderate in pre-Collapse
period, but now a good friend of the Regency. Ferrond
is ruled by a hereditary monarchy, the current dynasty
being over 700 years old. Ferrond dominates an entire
continent by itself, centered within the worlds
equatorial belt. The country is heavily
industrialised, and is currently advancing to TL 9 at
a very fast pace. Politically the state is regressive,
even anachronistic, and is increasingly outpaced by
the Kingdoms' rapid urbanisation and development.
 <P>
<B> Magnus Imperium (Pop: 970,000,000):</B> Ferrond's chief
rival and leader of the Maelstrom League. Magnus is
located at the edge of Noveterres southern temperate
latitudes, and is primarily dry savannah and cool
steepe.  Magnus was heavily victimised in the past by
offworld marauders, making it a swaggering
expansionistic state with a history of military
aggression and intervention against its neighbors.
While the state is heavily industrialised, the
ownership structure is lopsided towards the monarchy
and its supporting nobility, creating widespread
poverty. This deprivation not only keeps the
Imperium's diverse population under control, it also
creates hard feelings among the common people that are
rechanneled into martial pursuits.
 <P>
<B> New Ferrond Coalition (Pop: 500,000,000):</B> Former
overseas colony of the UKF, and now a premier power in
its own right. While ostensibly a unified monarchy
along the lines of its parent, poor internal
communications placed most actual power within the
nobility. This has led to long periods of civil war
between factions, and has undermined its economic
development and political integration.
 <P>
<B> Lateran Council (Pop: 420,000,000):</B> Religious state
bordering upon Magnus.  The Council is ruled by a
parallel structure of both secular and religious
authorities.  It has a long history of domination by
Magnus, and has fought numerous wars of independence
against their neighbors. Currently a reluctant member
of the Maelstrom League. It was the LC that sparked
the renaissance in Novoterre's sciences and learning,
and is the most democratic and progressive of its
nations. It obedience to the League is insured by the
heavy presence of Magnusian troops within its border
provinces.
 <P>
<B> Forenza Republic (Pop: 400,000,000):</B> Extreme
southern state within Novoterres frigid taiga zone.
Forenza was settled by, and is currently populated by
the descendants, of encroaching marauders. Forenza and
Magnus therefore have a long history of bitter enmity.
However, that enmity has diminished in favor of shared
self-interest, and the Republic is a strong supporter
of the Maelstrom League. Forenzan troops are infamous
for their toughness and fanaticism in battle, and are
often used as shock and security troops in Maelstrom
occupied lands.
 <P>
<B> Paladinate (Pop: 330,000,000):</B> Oppressive military
dictatorship located near Magnus-Lateran. Founded out
of the conquest of states previously ravaged by
Magnusian and Forenzan aggression. Many of these
states joined willingly after centuries of military
ravaging. Pro-Iridian.
 <P>
<B>Bergandine (Pop: 275,000,000):</B> Renegade section of
UKF that seceeded in 945. The Alliance is a coalition
of powerful nobility and warlords opposed to offworld
contact, mostly because they harbor vague dreams of
interstellar conquest at the expense of the existing
stellar communities.  While isolationist, the local
lords often hire large contigents of offworld mercs to
train their forces in "superior" space tactics.
 <P>
<B>Welles-Corundum (Pop: 210,000,000):</B> Large coalition
of independent city-states inconveniently located
between Magnus-Lateran and the NFC. Consequently it
has been invaded and occupied on numerous occasions.
Currently it is under Maelstrom control.  Hyphenated
name is the artifact of its previous existence as two
seperate countries, before amalgamating together in
1081. Despite constant attacks, locals have become
inured to occupation, and show considerable skill in
rebuilding. Novoterre's largest downport is located
near the capitol city of Sapphire.
