This small frigid world is the home to the largest
urban population ever recorded in Imperial Space. The
surface of Askigaak is bitterly cold, and its
world-ocean frequently freezes over in the wintering
hemisphere. However the seafloor is bisected by
thousands of hot spots and volcanic plumes that
prevent the world from completely freezing over, and
are rich sources of geothermal energy and minerals.
Askigaak is a relatively old world, and most of its
surface life has become extinct, and the surviving
oceanic life is dependent upon these heat sources for
basic survival.
<P>
When Askigaak was first surveyed in 58, the world was
found to be rich source of mineral ores and other
resources necessary for the Imperium's expansion into
the Spinward Marches. Star Lane was the main connector
to the Spinward Main, and the world's close proximity
would allow its factories and mines to supply the
colonisation effort with little pain. Unfortunately,
this interest petered out after the rise of competing
industrial centers in nearby Sabine Subsector in the
400s, and Askigaak became the backwater king of a
backwater subsector.
<P>
As was the case with many first wave colonisations
into Deneb, the first colonists were mostly Vilani.
While later waves brought larger groups of Solomani,
the frigid climate and shortage of fuels and food
guaranteed that the cooperation centered Vilani
culture would predominate and be practiced by the new
arrivals. Land shortages and a runaway birth rate
caused major overcrowding that was partially
alleviated by terraforming of new islands. But most of
the population lived in oceanic habitats that
sacrificed most amenities as expensive luxuries after
the world was bypassed by Imperial commerce. Like
Ashasi the locals are aloof from most offworld
contact, but where it is pride for Ashasians, it is
simple survival for 'Gaaks.
<P>
The large population is a sign of their success at
surviving on their world. But it overstrains the local
ecosystem, and the population is even more dependent
upon artificial life support than before. Food is
fungus or genetically modified algae grown in large
vats on wastes and sewage. Though crude and
unappetizing, it is never in short supply no matter
how large the population has grown. More damaging is
the unchecked dumping of industrial wastes into the
local air and water; the world is no longer capable of
naturally filtering pollution, and the water and air
are not fit for normal consumption. The reliance upon
geothermal heat sources and labor intensive industry
create most of this pollution, as does inadequate
sewage treatment.
<P>
The current cities resemble huge industrial
facilities, minimalist and functional in appearance
and design. The population lives in small, closet-like
apartments, organised around a central life support
plant, known as Wards. Local government is brutally
simple; an overseer is elected or appointed to govern
all aspects of life for a community Ward, and their
word traditionally is life or death. Because of the
natural warmth of close proximity to other people,
many wards are actually extended families, and the
Overseer is a patriarch/matriarch of advanced age and
recognised wisdom. The locals rarely do anything
outside of their family, and usually travel or
entertain themselves in groups. Conformity is heavily
stressed, even more so than normal for Vilani culture,
and the population wears bland but well insulated
uniforms that communicate their status in their
families.
<P>
With few outlets for creativity or disatisfaction,
local politics becomes the main means of entertainment
and individual expression. While nominally ruled by
the ducal seat (which has been under the control of
the Tukera family since the Alkhalikoi ascension),
real government is a "Feuding" Technocracy of
bureaucratic managers, civic leaders and local family
overseers. Despite the huge size of the population,
allegiances and loyalties are complex and convoluted.
The swirling alliances of different wards are contests
for control over vital industrial facilities,
particularly high value sites like offworld exports
and starport concessions, and vital government jobs
and postings. Political contests are decided by
majority elections and votes in the assembly overseen
by the Duke, but enormous amounts of intrigue go into
creating a majority consensus among wards and their
voters, with factions promising patronage jobs and
political payoffs to potential supporters.
<P>
As a result most government officials are highly
corrupt, though bribery and meddling by offworlders
are not tolerated. Local crime is nonexistent, and
offworld perpetrators are subject to lengthy sentences
for trivial crimes. Local offenders are usually
outcast into the local wilderness, where they usually
perish from exposure or hunger, being spurned by the
entire community. Such exile is of limited duration,
and those who survive the ordeal are eventually
forgiven and reintegrated into the community as
heroes.
<P>
Since the Collapse, and the subsequent invasion of the
Kishkii in 1139, Askigaak has been elevated by the
Industrial Development Program into a very important
industrial world. Because of its massive population,
updated education programs would create a very large
number of skilled workers and professional personnel
desperately needed by the Regency for its war against
Virus. Development has been slowed by local politics,
and despite major progress, the world has fallen well
short of its potential. The education and development
programs were originally tailored towards individual
initiative, and clashed head on with the local
consensus based society. Despite this the world has
become home to a number of vital military industries,
including the Regency government shipyards of Plant 60
and 61. Progression to TL-15 is steady, with
attainment in around twenty years.
<P>
Since 1186, the Askigaaki government has been
negotiating with Aziziyah and Rimkuku in the hopes of
appropriating them as colonies to stem continuing
overcrowding. Initially it was hoped to relocate up to
half of the population, but resistance from the
population, technical and economic limitations, and
the coincidence of the Frontier's reopening has
reduced this to perhaps a few billion to each world in
the next quarter century.
