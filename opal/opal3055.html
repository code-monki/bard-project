<h3>Precollapse Data</h3>
Galiano was the nominal Subsector Capital, and chief naval base of Operations for Margaret's Navy in its rimward battles with the Solomani Confederation Navy, until due to attrition and the retraction of 1124-25 back to the Coreward subsectors A-D, especially around Vaward  relocated the Fleet HQ & Nobility. This evacuation had a profound affect on Galiano, leaving the remnants of the Megacorporations, Tukera Lines, LSP, Instellarms, General Products, GsBAG, SuSAG, Delagdo, & Hortalez et Cie, LIC, as the existing powers that be on the planet as Solomani & Imperial fortunes waxed & waned thru the subsector over <a href="opal3052.html">Imperial Depot</A>
<P>
	As an Earth like planet (both in atmosphere & hydrosphere) the effects of the economic contraction of the Hard Times (1124-1130) were minimal. Tech loss fell to TL-13, and its Starport declined to C-class in 1125, and sustained the Imperial Naval Base adding only one more corporation to the mix, Transstar, of the Confederation. (Research shows the Solomani occupied Galiano until the end of the War & onset of Virus, despite maps showing world in "Wilds" zoning). Only the Imperial Navy & Imperial Nobility had fled.<P>
For maintaining the Solomani fleets, and protection of their system, they were granted self-autonomous control of the planet. The old representational democracy government had evolved into a feudal technocracy, ensuring jobs, stability, and order. The peace treaty between the Federation of Daibei, Margaret's Domain, and the Solomani signifying the end of hostilities, was signed here on Galiano for the Old Expanses (1129-30). Virus' arrival made the peace short lived, however.
<P>
<h3>The Collapse (1130-31)</h3> The Technocrats of the mega corps remained, and within Tukera Lines, the Vermene, Tukera, LIC's private espionage unit (those not exterminated by IRIS, that is). A minor member of the Tukera family, Brion Tukera, (2nd cousin to (then) owner Blaine Tukera) escaped Delphi sector and arrived during the brief peace period, with his family & some retainers to warn of the impending disaster approaching. Unfortunately, while good order was maintained, each Megacorp & F-Tech sought to preserve its assets individually, not as a team effort. Many of the larger Solomani warships evacuated to Solee, for instance, depriving the system of qualified naval personnel to prepare the Orbital Navy Base from Virus. Due to its relative isolation along a J-2 route Coreward to rimward, Galiano was spared the worst of die-offs, and indeed, despite the losses in Technology, vowed they'd retake the stars. Many of the freighters & merchant vessels were saved however, being grounded planet side and shut down, or were in for repairs. The Solomani did however leave their SDB's and nonjump spacecraft in droves.
<P>
The balkanization rating on Galines, (as they renamed themselves) of today, comes not so much on a national sense country-ethnic wise, but along corporate & technological lines, as well as system world occupation.  Galines still has her (now) C-class orbital port, as well as several ground based C-ports, for example, one owned by each of the starship manufacturers, GsBAG, Ling Standard Products, & General Products. The orbital Starport is owned & operated by the merger of Tukera Lines & Transstar, descended from its regional managers, Brion Tukera & Alistassja Hapsburg into Tukera-Hapsburg Lines, or TKHL, LIC.  They are the most powerful corporation today, and dictate policy to the rest as to where trade off planet will go. These two Mega corps, coupled with the remnants of Hortalez et Cie, LIC, which arrived with a substantial multi-trillion credit cash deposit on this once-future "Hub-Interface" between Margaret & the Confederation, are the controlling powerhouses, much like the Terran Zaibatsu Combines of Pre WW II Japan.
H.e. C. with its large cash deposit in the initial Virus wave stood alone in calm as local planetary banks failed as electronic accounts vanished and the run on the banks occurred. When the smoke cleared, they stood alone as the sole banking-Investment institute in 1134 on the planet. Their merger with longtime partner Tukera Lines assured the world's populace that This Virus thing was a "horrible, but not long lasting emergency". The Feudal Technarches soon were sorted out alliance wise in this "New-world Order". Today, the Megacorps resemble states in areas of commerce & manufacturing.  Trade & Prosperity would survive if there were markets, and the markets were on other worlds! The period of 1136-1180's saw some exploratory efforts, as well as retaking their system and expansion of their gas giant mining operations (Ling-Sternmetal General Products, LIC or LSGP, LIC).
<P>
By the mid 1140's the Totalitarian Oligarchs of Galines began to reconnect commercially to the adjacent worlds, including <a href="opal3053.html">Thanatos</A>, Kunni</A>, Indigo, <a href="opal3054.html">Czerniak</A>, and Walager, while creating "way station" Starports on the abandoned/evacuated worlds of Skerry & Krag   to support this new trade route. Due to the three-dozen surviving Tukera 3kton J-4 liners needing C-class Starports (orbital) for usage (they are an USL design), the Combined Corps of Galines decided on a "commercial conquest" campaign. They envisioned a J-4 webbed by C-port class worlds open (and later, "opened for", like it or not) to interstellar trade. The remaining larger vessels, such as their half dozen relic Imperial Bulk 20kton freighters could work the J-3 routes. Large modules could be jumped out into the stellar gaps to form refueling stations for the J-1 bulk freighters (the ubiquitous 400 dton LSP IDP Subsidized Liners & <I>Morraine</I> class 200 dton Free Trader ships) that they, and what few Free Traders still plied the region, also had in plentitude.
<P>
Kunni's balkanized seven Representational governments of their 8 million citizens balked at the idea, but faced with a need to maintain their economies, several of the major countries were persuaded to open up to trade food stuffs & mineral rights for farm machinery (combines, tractors, disking equipment, harvesters, Water purification/irrigation systems, etc) and electronics (TV's, radios, improved radar systems for Air-defense, etc) in 1144-48, in return for having both a groundside & Orbital C-class port built, maintained by Galinian techs, with local hired help in the food & entertainment industries. As trade had occurred traditionally with Galines prior to the war, Kunnites found it easier to accept the effort rather than resist, though the other countries have only boast D & E-class ports.
<P>
Thanatos' s participatory government core ward of Galines, with an existent C-class port & eight million sentients, had suffered only minor tech loss, and had maintained the same government despite law level dropping to 0. Open to free traders and interstellar Trade, they were agreeable to re-contact & enjoyed being able to ship their asteroid mined refined products out for foodstuffs. They voted to join the "Democratic Accord of Galines"(DAG) as well, in this same period, and have since, as the first C-port world to join up, returned to their former Tech level of 9. Though the Thanatosian Belters & Gas Giant miners are sure to drive hard bargains with Ling-Sternmetal.
<P>
Czerniak's Precollapse B-class Starport survived, as did its Scout base. They too benefit from the J-4 route triangle between Thanatos-Galines  & themselves. A Mystic Autocracy governs Czerniak's 19 billion citizens, the former psionic institute, save their control is invisible as well. Czerniak entered into the DAG after much debate, but are an "equal controlling member" of Technology in the chain of commerce. They too are Balkanized along Corporate lines, but with greater diversification (without the huge Collapse mergers Galines experienced.)
<P>
Walager was contacted by both Czerniak & Galines for the same reasons, Trade for her Ag products. Walager's Civil Service Bureaucracies, governing her balkanized low-tech (TL-2) countries & five million sentient citizens (20% or 1 million are Droyne) were extremely xenophobic to contact. Galines failed & Czerniak succeeded, raising the technophobic former TL-B world back to a modest TL-5. Due to the sentiments of the populations, only a D-class starport groundside has been built. Walager is considered a member of the DAG, but is treated as a Protectorate/Client state (its still balkanized), as of 1200, NE.<P>
Indigo's TED was contacted and "made an offer he couldn't refuse". His TL-6 world, isolated from the outside of the rest of the subsector by J-2 access, had severely declined (fallen from TL-E). His twenty million subjects labored under his restrictive law level 8 (though not as high as Walager's A), he at first rejected opening up in 1148. The Vermene were sent in to scout out his markets, and rising middle class mercantile interests in the 1150's. He was assassinated by rivals sponsored by the Vermene/TKHL in 1160, and it was announced the following day by the coup beneficiaries that The world would re-open to the DAG trade fleets as soon as the new Starports (High & downside) were rebuilt). LSGP & TKHL, LIC moved in at once, establishing an initial D-class port, for the J-2 trade, and began hiring out Belters from Thanatos to work the two rich but abandoned belts in system. The planet's TL-6 wares and goods are shipped to TL-5 worlds in the DAG accordingly.  Formaly made a member state of DAG in 1180 after the orbital C-class port was finished.
<P>
Skerry's feeder C-port was begun in 1160's, and despite setbacks and vampire raids, was completed in the mid 1190's (C-334214-9), with aide from Solee.
<P>
Krag's feeder port is only D-class, but has a substantial Salvager operation ongoing for the TL-10 relic machinery there. Construction began in 1148; it was completed in 1156 (D-737317-9), with salvagers out of Thanatos. This was the first boneyard world opened by the DAG.
<P>
<h3>Relationship with the Soleean Star Empire</h3>
	Contact with Solee's former collapse corrupt Impersonal bureaucratic govt was strained at best after being "abandoned" by the Solomani fleet. Trade ensued sporadically throughout the 1150's-70's (They had a C-class port as well), and allowed Free Traders access as well, but Galines' TO's weren't satisfied with their end of the arrangement. Remnants of Solomani Security existed there, and together with TKHL's Vermene and willing Soleean Naval officers, aided & funded the coup that placed Gabriella Ramstatten "upon the throne". This, coupled with the 1189, breakthroughs in anti-Virus weaponry & computer systems to clear out infected systems and relic ships grounded there, began a path from which the DAG Techno Oligarchs would soon find hard to steer from. Solee began an earnest plan of restoration & training crews after recovering her first dozen warships. Whereas the DAG had hoped Solee would become a viable market (it did) they also had need to defend their new Trade Polity, as raiding Guild ships began to attack in the early 1190's. Solee's In-system Navy and that of Galines had veteran service people, but most SDB crewmen were tied to local defenses. Galines hoped to convince Solee to use their new recovered ships to help defend their convoys from raiders. Restoration of their naval base for System defense of these insystem outposts also was begun, by mutual agreement. The base was restored to its Pre-collapse C-status by 1197, with help from Solee's Navy technical division. But Solee had other plans, namely recovering Ultraneta' s system former A-class port & Imperial Naval Depot site facilities. Ramstatten had the upper hand in the deal, and for exclusive use of their anti-Virus silicon based computer treatments, worked out a deal with Galines as well-for every warship "recovered" three merchant ships were as well. Over a barrel themselves for a change, the TKHL & LSGP Oligarchs caved.
	Solee was also taking their Pre-stellar "Gunboat/for Trade" diplomacy technique to new worlds as well in the 1190's, with varied successes, bogging down on Marcena   & Hindahl   but did well with Kmak, as well as establishing boneyard worlds on Herbe & Sovtor, among other dead worlds with deep sited scout bases to spy upon future worlds to annex in the rimward direction of the Shenk subsector. In order to get what they wanted, the worlds of the DAG agreed to "Merge" with Solee & suffer her protection for their trade empire. This Polity merger coincided with the 21 world's Sector "League of Bonsher's" TL-9 worlds .
<P>
<h3>In the New Era</h3>
As of 001-1202 Galines UWP now reads A-767989-A, N, Hi In, B204, SSE (Soleean Star Empire), thanks to recovered machinery from Ultraneta by the Soleean "Jayna" Fleet.

(Transstar-Tukera Lines-Hortalez merger) These Techno Oligarchs have the monopoly on starship maintenance & own all of the starports. All trade outsystem and insystem moves on their vessels, and its irksome that LGSP's mining refining vessels are not included in that sphere of commerce. Has enforced the Ban on private ownership of Starships(even though the threat of Virus has diminished immensely).

(Ling Standard Products-General Products-Sternmetal Horizons merger, now called Ling Sternmetal General Products) These Techno Oligarchs have the monopoly on  large (400+dtons) starship/ spaceship production, as well as all other vehicle manufacturing, consequently they own all the production plants/Shipyards, as well as power plant manufacturing. All insystem mining is also under their domain, though trouble with Thanatos' old LSP independent "colony" is a source of concern.

<B>Corruption:</B> Low<BR>
<B>Cruelty:</B> Low<BR>

(Delgado-GsBAG merger) The media giant, in communications, virus-proof software & Systems, specializing in small starships(100-300dtons)/Spacecraft (10-400dtons), is also a main ally of SuSAG in the field of nanotechnology, as it applies to the medical field.

<P>
<h4>Instellarms, LIC</h4>

<B>Corruption:</B> High<BR>
<B>Cruelty:</B> Moderate<BR>
<B>Aggression:</B> High<BR>
<B>Xenophobia:</B> Low<P>
(Instellarms has sole monopoly on weapons for air-sea-land & space vehicles on Galines, including Starship's missiles). Gets its radioactives from LSGP's mining concerns. Also deals in the Weapons trade throughout the DAG and now SSE worlds, selling the next highest TL of Small-arms weapons to client worlds "Military Governors"( Soleean approved TEDs) (ie, Kata- Selling TL-7 weapons one level above its TL-6. Buys and resells older weapon systems to lower tech worlds as well. Then buys Kata TL-6 systems, sells them to TL-5 worlds' military forces). Due to its power and influence, it has oversight on the military preparedness of the system.
<P>
<h3>Armed forces</h3>

<P>
<LI> <B>Ground Forces:</B> 1,000,000, in 50x divisional units arranged in Army groups of 5 divisions (5x at TL-15 veteran (1 Army)/ 15x at TL-13 experienced (3 Armies)/ 30x Security Corporate Police/SWAT units, TL-10, trained).
<P>
<LI> <B>Wet Navy:</B> 500,000, with 167 major combatants (16x atTL-15 [all 16x are PADM/Meson gunned Submarines] elite / 48x TL-13 [again, all are PADM/Meson gunned submarines] veterans /103x TL-9 experienced crews), 500 small combatants (50x TL-15/ 150x TL-13/ 300x TL-10).
<P>
<LI> <B>Air Force:</B> 200,000, with 1000 combat aircraft (100x TL-15 Space Ftrs [10 squadrons] veteran/ 300x TL-13 Space Ftrs [30 squadrons] experienced/ 600 x aerospace interceptors TL-9/10 [60 squadrons] trained).
<P>
<LI> <B>SAD forces:</B> 200,000, with 400 PADM batteries of 4x launchers each (40x TL-15/ 120 x TL-13/ 240 x TL-9/10)
<P>
<LI> <B>Space Force:</B> 100,000, with 33x large combatants of 1000dtons +, (4x at TL-15, captured Imperial vessels & are Jump capable/ 12x at TL-13 most likely non-jump modified Ramrod class SDB's/ 17x TL9/10 half are non-jump Monitors, the rest are Orimmot-class Navy Logistic ships or Oases class fuelers from converted X-boat tenders, the TL-15 innards stripped out for other vessels); 100x small combatants of 990-100dtons (10x TL-15 /30x TL-13 / 60x TL9/10), of these half are jump capable, armed jump shuttles (400dtons J-4, 150dtons J-2/1), that double for shifting SDB's as well as non-jump freighter ships.
<P>
<B>Note:</B> this does not include surviving merchant ship hulls operating or awaiting repairs/restoration for TKHL, LIC. Initially based on TL and population, I extrapolated some 280 some odd vessels existing. I halved the number for combat & merchant ships.  Due to the governmental nature of the planet, and the emphasis on trade, even at "gunpoint", I figured TKHL's fleet along these lines: (Jump capable all):
 47x ships in excess of 1000dtons (16x Tukera Liner-class ships (3ktons each/J-4); 11x Fuer-class ships (2.5ktons each/J-3), 4x TransImperiallines Frontier Traders, (2ktons each J-2), 3x Starhauler bulk freighters (1kton /J-3); 3x AH Hercules bulk freighters (5ktons/J-1 (or 2); 3x Imperial Bulk freighters (20ktons/J-3); 3x Ursula Freight Tractors (MT TL-13/2 ktons/ J-4 (or 2) with 2000dtons of cargo pods); 3x Solomani Lanthanum Queen class Medium bulk-ore freighters (MT TL-13/10ktons/ J-3); 1x Tasadian Jump carrier (MT TL-15/ 3ktons/ J-6(empty/ down to J-1 with 10ktons carried).
	The 100 smaller vessels (armed of course!) are 50% Solomani made, 50% Imperial relic ships (All the TNE Merchant vessels 600-200dtons, like the A2 Jayhawk Far Trader/ Modified Subsidized freighter (400dtons/J-1)/ and Morraine class Free Trader (200dtons/J-1) and the Bastien-Stellar class Subsidized Liner (600dtons/J-3) among them). Solomani Nishemani-Rose class Corsairs/Lt freighters amongst them. (440 dtons/J-3) & Sundowner class Far Traders (400dtons/J-2).
