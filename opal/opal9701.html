The Grudovo Pendant is a j-1 cluster of 13 worlds that
connects Tobia/Trojan Reach with neighboring
Usher/Reft. Originally a cluster of little economic
presence or importance, its economic value has risen
in proportion with the rising volume of trade that
passes between Lintl and Tobia.<P>


<P>

Banskonno is divided between human, Aslan and Droyne
communities scattered across the planet.  Because of
the wide distances between them, contact and trade are
rare, and confrontations often occur when they do
meet. Most of the world's water is locked in scattered
salt lakes and seas, and each community is zealously
protective of "their" water.  Banskonno's shipyard is
owned by Clan Severn, formerly of Trin/Trin's Shroud.
The company's main office and plant were destroyed by
the <I>Kishkii</I>, and the Banskonno facility is the only
surviving remnant of that once great company. Severn's
yards primarily provide maintenance service for units
of the 128th Fleet returning from patrol from the
Rift. Banskonno is the primary interface worlds for
passage from the Safe to the Islands.
