<P>

This is an interpretive update of UWP data in <cite>Regency Sourcebook</cite>.
This is chiefly to explain changes in data that
occured between 1117 and 1202. This section covers
Regency held portions of Reft.
<P>
This data has been confined to the Regency in light of
the major impact of major events like the Abandonment,
Fait Accompli and the Representational Reforms. The
format goes by subsector, broken down into individual
world entries, which are further divided by 1117 and
1202 UPP data, followed by brief comments on the
reason or mechanism of change, and in some cases a
brief explanation for its current conditions.

<h3>Vestus Subsector</h3> A major part of the Stronghold.
Vestus was in a better state of development than its
neighbors in Deneb, the result of trade moving down
from Deneb itself to the Aslan interface. The
subsector was the main home for General Development
Corp (GEDCO) a consortium of nobles and their
investors who were dedicated to uplifting the local
worlds to higher level of technological and economic
development.  Their success made them the model for
the Regency's later IDP, and their spirit has
prevented the subsector from falling entirely under
the influence of Lintl's oppressive religious
government.

<P><B>Population (1117/1201):</B> 44.6/65.9 Billion
<BR><B>Industrial Worlds:</B>  2
<BR><B>Mean Tech Level(1117/1202):</B> 14.8/14.9
<BR><B>Senate Contingent:</B> 99

<h4>Cauldron      </h4>    <B>1117:</B> D9B8222-4
       <BR><B>1202:</B>  C9B8245-9         AR<P>

Cauldron, as its name implies, is a witches brew of
different corrosive gases.  The 1117 tech level
reflects the original community, a chemical extraction
facility without only primitive means of fabrication.
The facility has recieved new investment since then,
as many industrial processes make use of its
atmosphere.

<h4>Eakhiytlei    </h4>    <B>1117:</B> B3536BG-7
       <BR><B>1202:</B>  B3536MA-8         FA<P>

Formerly known as Reudden. Not every world taken by
the Aslan was converted into an alien slum. This world
was ruled by a brutal military dictatorship. When
Aslan invaders appeared in 1120, they were welcomed by
the human populace as liberators.

<h4>Kukaa         </h4>    <B>1117:</B> C544100-B
       <BR><B>1202:</B>  C544300-A         CD<P>

This world has simply become a greater version of what
it already was. Most of its new colonists were simply
refugees from the Aslan invasion who fell to the
wayside or were vagabonds anyway, who found a home
waiting for them in this permissive culture.

<h4>Amoirve       </h4>    <B>1117:</B> B565476-C
       <BR><B>1202:</B>  B565413-B         AR/CD<P>

Amoirve was partially abandoned by its inhabitants in
the face of Ihatei incursions. After being retaken by
the Regency in 1131, the colony charter was bought out
by Spinward Development Corp..

<h4>Solbatn       </h4>    <B>1117:</B> B87A443-A
       <BR><B>1202:</B>  B87A452-C         CD/RR<P>

Solbatn's new government hopes to attract increased
trade and development. Underdeveloped waterworlds like
this one have attracted much attention, especially in
Deneb sector, as an alternative means of habitation
for overcrowded industrial and high population worlds.


<h4>Nexus         </h4>    <B>1117:</B> D200201-8
          <BR><B>1201:</B>  C200311-A         AR/CD<P>

Formerly known as Dimple. Nexus recieved a new scout
way station after the Rape of Trin, and administration
of the world was turned over by the RISS to a private
company.

<h4>Carian        </h4>    <B>1117:</B> B300459-B
        <BR><B>1202:</B>  A300524-D         RR<P>

Carian's feudal technocracy had long been unpopular
with the local populace, because of its strong
reliance upon the navy for employment. After
negotiations with the 19th Fleet, the government was
replaced with a more amenable demos. Strangely enough,
the world's economy has become even more reliant upon
the base for survival.

<h4>Fraser        </h4>    <B>1117:</B> B474211-B
        <BR><B>1202:</B>  B474425-C         AR/CD<P>

Formerly known as Corp Town. The world had been a
research colony for SuSAG, and reportedly,
Instellarms, during the antebellum period. Aslan
Ihatei never reached this world, but the threat they
represented caused a hurried evacuation of the world
in 1121. The now empty world and its infrastructure
was taken over by a colony group from Lintl in 1133,
and it has prospered ever since.

<h4>Lintl         </h4>    <B>1117:</B> B739AEE-F
        <BR><B>1202:</B>  A739AEE-F         **<P>

Lintl has become one of the most important industrial
worlds in the Regency. The local xenophobia has
diminished since 1132, and the religious dictatorship
has lost nearly all of its power to secular
bureaucratic agencies that retain the old ruling
council as a mere formality.  Most of the population
lives in either deep underground or underwater
arcologies, though more and more people are being
moved into orbital habitats or new floating cities to
counteract the claustrophobic tendencies of the old
regime.

<h4>Adamant       </h4>    <B>1117:</B> C251110-9
        <BR><B>1202:</B>  C251100-9         **<P>

Formerly known as Whisp. The local corporation was a
shell, a mere formality to prevent offworld
encroachment into the claims of the local belter
community.

<h4>Gaspar        </h4>    <B>1117:</B> B376337-D
        <BR><B>1202:</B>  B376410-D         RR<P>

Gaspar's old ruling elite was displaced in the
Reforms. The current government is a local development
company empowered by the populace with increasing
offworld trade and contact. Gaspar is located along
the burgeoning trade route between Lintl and Colony
Five, and provides access to complementary markets for
the Stronghold.

<h4>Igualada      </h4>    <B>1117:</B> B140567-9
        <BR><B>1202:</B>  B140577-A         RR<P>

Igualada was granted partial home rule from Gaspar in
1161. Several outlying communities wanted a bigger
share of the trade revenue coming through the
starport, which is conveniently located along the
"Rift Highway" connecting Lintl to Tobia.

<h4>Zaguki        </h4>    <B>1117:</B> B260262-9
        <BR><B>1202:</B>  B260454-9         Ab<P>

Another source of heavy fighting between Ihatei and
local humans during the Civil War. The world was still
contested between Ihatei and Domain Marines when the
Collapse rolled in, and the world was largely given
over to the invaders, albeit under a human style
government. Tensions still remain between the local
garrison and the mostly Aslan population, and an Amber
Zone has been posted in addition to its normal
Frontier rating.

<h4>Elixir        </h4>    <B>1117:</B> B768321-9
        <BR><B>1202:</B>  A768587-C         Ab<P>

Rival colonial claims had prevented this world from
recieving its due. These claims are still wending
their way through the Regency courts, complicated by
the Collapse. Large sections of the outback are
offlimits to the current colonists, pending a
resolution. The Amber Zone reflects past
confrontations between rival groups over disputed
claims. Elixir's Amber Zone is a reflection of the
worlds often violent weather patterns, the result of
its eccentric orbit around its primary.

<h3>Macon Subsector</h3> Macon Subsector is culturally tied
to neighboring Zeng/Deneb. As such it was also party
to many of the same political battles that erupted in
the wake of the Representational Reforms. Macon has
never been that important economically in of itself,
but its development by GeDCO in the antebellum period
became crucial to the Regency after the Collapse, as
it became a conveyor for the vital trade between Usani
and Zeng, and the Aslan Interface.  The subsector has
seen major population movements since the Civil War,
the result of corporate pullouts and political
troubles on Gorod.

<P><B>Population (1117/1201):</B> 1 Billion/700 Million
<BR><B>Industrial Worlds:</B>  None
<BR><B>Mean Tech Level(1117/1202):</B> 9/10
<BR><B>Senate Contingent:</B> 37

<h4>Evet's World  </h4>    <B>1117:</B> B201656-D
        <BR><B>1202:</B>  B201556-E         **<P>

Evet's World was home to the research and
manufacturing facilities of Naasirka and Makhidkarun,
which mostly produced computer and robotic components
for the BTC market. These companies pulled out in
1121, and the remaining factories were shuttered by
concerns over Virus and infection.  The world's
disastrous unemployment was partially allayed by the
reopening of a few upgraded facilities that produce
for the military.  The Amber Zone is a reflection of
violent solar flare activity.

<h4>Earl Center   </h4>    <B>1117:</B> A998011-9
       <BR><B>1202:</B>  A998111-B         CD<P>

This world is owned by Ling Standard Products, which
used it as a warehousing facility before the Civil War
period. In earlier times it had been a major
manufacturing center for the company, before
industrial pollution and changing markets caused a
pullout of these facilities hundreds of years ago.
Most of this pollution remains, and has discouraged
new colonisation. Nevertheless, LSP would like to open
the world to wider development, and has undertaken
surveys in the last decade to determine the extent of
its resources.

<h4>Yvette        </h4>    <B>1117:</B> A79A633-D
      <BR><B>1202:</B>  A79A735-E         Ab<P>

Despite chilly temperatures, increased trade between
the Thinrim and the Stronghold boosted Yvette
economically. The local oligarchy is a
"techno-aristocracy" of successful businessmen and
investors.

<h4>Oleiros       </h4>    <B>1117:</B> B000457-D
       <BR><B>1202:</B>  B000357-D         Ab<P>

Ling Standard Products and Tukera owned several major
facilities here in the Antebellum period. The
population loss is a reflection of the abandonment of
the system by Tukera in 1127, and the later
Abandonment due to Virus. Several facilities have been
purchased by the Delphi Foundation, a "non-profit"
group affiliated with the surviving Tukera family.

<h4>Sestao       </h4>    <B>1117:</B> A120675-C
        <BR><B>1202:</B>  A120658-E         GA/RR<P>

Sestao has always been a vital naval base for the
Third Imperium, for it was the spinward end of the
Imperial Governments secret courier route across the
Great Rift. In fact the local naval base commander was
always of Vice Admiral rank or higher, with full
command authority over Deneb and Reft sector military
commands, to enforce Imperial edicts at once. When
Strephon sent advance warning about Virus to the
Domain of Deneb, Sestao again fulfilled this vital
role, and the command to impose and enforce what would
become the Quarantine came from here. The various
feuding communities were placed under a unitary
military government in response to the crisis, and
only regained home rule in 1182.

<h4>Gorod         </h4>    <B>1117:</B> D6689CG-9
        <BR><B>1202:</B>  C66888A-A         EC/RR<P>

Gorod's repressive "Council of Princes" tried for
years to ignore the Representational Reforms. The
Council's control was loosened by the growing need for
trade within the Regency, which undermined their
attempts at isolating the population from "spurious"
contact and its infectious ideas of democratic reform
and economic progress. Fear of revolution led to
growing factionalism within the Council. This led to a
brief bout of bloody civil war starting in 1158,
undermining popular confidence that reform would ever
be enacted, and the Escape Clause caused the flight of
hundreds of millions of people to Zeng and Vestus. The
war finally sputtered out in 1162, and the surviving
Council was convinced by the Regency government to
accept a compromise under the Reforms, and the local
bureaucracy succeeded it in 1165.



<h3>Usher Subsector</h3> This subsector was, and still is, an
underdeveloped backwater. This relative lack of
population and untapped resources made it an
attractive target to Aslan Ihatei even before the
Civil War, and the local Domain of Deneb forces
already had their hands full keeping out encroachers.
The Civil War caused the dam to break, and the region
was inundated with Ihatei that quickly swept aside the
local military garrisons. The collapse of this flank
eventually caused the collapse of the Domain's
defenses in neighboring Tobia/Trojan Reach, and by
1119 the invaders were beginning to infiltrate into
the Marches and even some parts of Deneb.  The
successful balance of power strategy pursued by the
new Trojan Reach sector duke slowed and then halted
their advance, and the Collapse allowed for the
recapture of the subsector in 1131.  Despite this,
Many sections of Usher are held only tentatively by
the Regency. Many areas that were placed into the
Frontier act as if nominally independent or under the
rule of the Aslan Hierate; caution is advised for
travellers moving through the region.

<P><B>Population (1117/1201):</B> 57.0/50.0 Million
<BR><B>Industrial Worlds:</B>  None
<BR><B>Mean Tech Level(1117/1202):</B> 8.7/9.1
<BR><B>Senate Contingent:</B> 43

<h4>Banskonno     </h4>    <B>1117:</B> A482444-C
       <BR><B>1202:</B>  A482574-E         FA<P>

Large Ihatei incursions created an Aslan population
too large to displace. After quick negotiations in
1131, large sections of the world were ceded to the
Aslan and declared Fait Accompli.

<h4>Wyokheafao    </h4>    <B>1117:</B> B737332-B
      <BR><B>1202:</B>  B7374M8-B         FA<P>

Formerly known as Bastion.  Heavy fighting caused the
loss of this world to the Aslan in 1117, and the
Regency would not reclaim the world until 1131.
Political necessity caused the world to be declared
Fait Accompli the following year. The local military
base is a cause for major concern for the Regency, as
it is the only Aslan military facility within the
sphere of its control. But because the facility is
located within the Frontier, the Regency can only keep
it under close surveillance.

<h4>Neon          </h4>    <B>1117:</B> D9B227A-4
        <BR><B>1202:</B>  X9B2000-0         Ab<P>

Neon had been previously home to several small gas
refineries with primitive facilities. Concern over
safety in the face of Virus caused the Regency to buy
out the local "governments" and evacuate the populace
safeside.

<h4>Tonnurad      </h4>    <B>1117:</B> B463695-7
        <BR><B>1202:</B>  B463787-7         AR<P>

The site of some of the heaviest fighting during the
Ihatei invasions. The recapture of this world was
accomplished by an actual Regency military invasion.
The world was considered to be too strategic to permit
Aslan domination, and a sizeable force of Marines and
Army troops were landed to seize the world and its
vital facilities, and to disarm the local clans. When
the clans resisted, the Regency troops were only too
happy to oblige them with measured force of their own,
and the local clan leaders and their Trekhyair were
forcibly ejected after brief fighting.

<h4>Fraaga        </h4>    <B>1117:</B> B691420-D
        <BR><B>1202:</B>  B691320-B         GA<P>

Fraaga was evacuated after several "near misses" with
Vampire Fleets during the period of 1141-52. At least
three fleets, and a number of Vampire "erratics"
penetrated the Rift at or near this world. While all
of these forces have been defeated before they could
inflict major damage, the Regency government relocated
the population to other nearby worlds, except for a
small population adjacent to the well defended
downport and scout base. Why Vampires succeed in
crossing the Rift here at Fraaga, and why they seem to
prefer this world has attracted heavy scrutiny, but no
real answers.

<h3>New Islands Subsector</h3> New Islands was severel ravaged
by 35 years of heavy fighting between the factions of
Serendip, New Colchis and Joyeuse.  Several worlds
were depopulated as a result of collateral damage, and
several remain on life support. Relations between the
Regency and the local industrial worlds are relatively
cool, though mostly as a residue of the bitter
hostility that exists between the warring groups. The
lesser worlds have come to see the Regency
Peacekeepers as saviors, and one world, Topas, has
permitted a Regency appointed governor to take over
rebuilding and administration. Privately many of these
worlds would like to see more forceful action by the
Regency, but the government is reluctant to spend more
resources in this region than it has too.

Population (1117/1202): 40.9/49.4 Billion
<BR><B>Industrial Worlds:</B>  4
<BR><B>Mean Tech Level(1117/1202):</B> 11.3/10.1

<h4>Zuflucht      </h4>    <B>1117:</B> C445655-7
        <BR><B>1202:</B>  C445720-8         IW<P>

The main interface world between the Islands and the
Regency has a wild and carefree existence. While
Island's worlds are quite distant from the main body
of the Regency, the level of trade and contact with it
are still quite significant for a region whose worlds
practiced economic self-sufficiency. The local
communities are filled with travellers waiting for
clearance to enter the Regency for various errands,
and a thriving set of businesses that cater to the
needs of arriving and departing Navy/RPKF units. The
local Amber Zone is supposed to reflect the heavy
security presence of the Regency military and RQS, but
increasingly seems to have more to do with the growing
bacchanalia down on the surface.

<h4>Wellington    </h4>    <B>1117:</B> C8B0263-A
        <BR><B>1202:</B>  X8B0000-0         IW<P>

The cause of Wellington's depopulation is still a
mystery to RQS forces examining the world. The local
facilities appear only lightly damaged, and no bodies
or war damage have been found.

<h4>Nebelwelt     </h4>    <B>1117:</B> C879425-5
      <BR><B>1202:</B>  C879567-5         IW<P>

Despite very cold temperatures and a high amount of
chlorine in the atmosphere, the world managed to
attract a fair number of refugees from Esperanza. The
population density eventually shifted to the
Anglophones, and the world declared its allegiance for
Esperanza in 1144, even though the homeworld is rarely
in contact with its local "representatives."

<h4>Gloire        </h4>    <B>1117:</B> C764567-9
        <BR><B>1202:</B>  E764769-8         IW<P>

Heavy fighting in the middle portion of the subsector,
and growing disenchantment with the Serendip
government drove millions of people from their homes
and to this warm and pleasant world. The starport was
apparently destroyed by a New Colchis strike force,
and the locals have not rebuilt it for a lack of money
and fear of further attacks. While still loyal to
Serendip, the Regency has become the main power on the
world, as its forces cushion against a return to the
bloody past.

<h4>New Colchis   </h4>    <B>1117:</B> A8959AA-C
      <BR><B>1202:</B>  A8959AD-B         IW<P>

New Colchis is the center of Anti-Regency fervor in
the subsector. Despite its heavy losses and profitless
military campaigns, the local government still clings
to the hope of resuming and winning the war no matter
what the cost.  The war has inflicted too much damage
to the world and loss of prestige for the local
dictatorship to declare a truce and accept peace.
While the world has not been specifically listed as an
Amber Zone, visiting Regency personnel recieve a
chilly, passive aggressive reception from the locals.
New Colchis' polluted and careworn cities are not
inviting places to visit anyway, and the increasingly
totalitarian regime is making them less so.

<h4>Orphee        </h4>    <B>1117:</B> X885600-0
        <BR><B>1202:</B>  X885647-0         IW<P>

Orphee is home to a peaceful hexapodal minor race. New
Colchis apparently contacted the world in 1109, and
annexed it into its sphere of control.  The Regency
divested them of the world in 1140 after hearing
reports of exploitation of the aliens. Because of the
offworld contact, interdiction was out of the
question, and a permanent RISS presence exists on the
world. The Orpheides have little interest in offworld
technological assistance after mistreatment at the
hands of the New Colchisians, and the scout contact
team has respected their wishes.

<h4>Topas         </h4>    <B>1117:</B> D120899-5
        <BR><B>1202:</B>  E120869-5         IW<P>

Topas suffered severely in the war between
Neubayern/Old Islands and Serendip. The small, hostile
world has adopted an RQS dominated government
structure in an effort to prevent future military
disruption.

<h4>Elysee        </h4>    <B>1117:</B> B502532-9
(1525)       <BR><B>1202:</B>  B502455-7         IW<P>

Elysee was severely damaged in fighting during the
war. The current government was enacted after Regency
forces arrived to enforce a truce. The local
communities are slowly falling apart from a lack of
qualified maintenance personnel and spare parts, and
the world may have to either evacuate completely or
accept greater Regency assistance. The locals are so
disgusted with the combatants that offworld forces
must carry out their battles far from the main
communities, or risk retaliatory attacks from the
populace.

<h4>Besancon      </h4>    <B>1117:</B> C201341-9
        <BR><B>1202:</B>  D201457-8         IW<P>

In contrast to Elysee, Besancon has actually increased
in population. A number of warring units "adopted"
local communities, and now use them to house their
dependents and logistical support personnel. Relations
with the local RQS are patchy, as the necessity of
offworld resupply tends to override any local
hostility felt for the peacekeepers.

<h4>Berlichengen  </h4>    <B>1117:</B> D600437-7
       <BR><B>1202:</B>  X600000-0         IW<P>

Berlichengen's demise was due to heavy battle damage
infliced by a Serendip strike force in 1132. Most of
the population perished in the attack, and the
remainder died of a lack of water, food and air in the
weeks that followed.  In a major departure from the
kids gloves treatment that typifies the Regency's
relations with the Islands, the Serendip military
officers responsible for this raid were seized, tried
and convicted for war crimes.

<h3>Old Islands Subsector</h3> The level of fighting in this
subsector was much less than in New Islands. Mostly
this was due to good relations between Sansterre and
New Home, which eliminated a military confrontation
between those two worlds, and allowed them to
concentrate their efforts against the other two major
powers. Damage was also reduced thanks to Neubayern's
divided attention and foolish insistence on fighting
three different fronts at once, and Amondiage's
disfunctional dictatorship. Nevertheless a number of
worlds were lost either due to battle damage or Viral
penetration under the cover of the fighting. Relations
with the Regency are much warmer, for unlike the New
Islands, the Old Islands have finally tired of
warfare, and are looking for a peaceful resolution.

Otherwise known as Sturgeon's Law. The world
apparently suffered a major life support failure in
1121, and spare parts for the system were denied by
the heavy fighting around them.  The system died in
1123, and resettlement is unthinkable, much less
feasible.

<h4>Neubayern     </h4>    <B>1117:</B> A7889C9-C
       <BR><B>1202:</B>  A7889C8-B         IW<P>
Neubayern has quietly stood down from a war footing in
the last twenty years. The local population has seen
its best and brightest cut down on numerous war
fronts, and the governments feckless attempt at
fighting nearly every faction it could has exhausted
the world economically and politically.  Political
dissent has been rising since it became clear that the
Regency would not relinquish control, and the populace
has demanded their leaders apply for investment and
reconstruction money from the Tower and the Regency
Safe. So far dissent has been muted, and the
government is looking for a compromise.

<h4>RQB Avant     </h4>    <B>1117:</B> C000366-A
        <BR><B>1202:</B>  D000367-B         GA<P>

Formerly known as Schleisen Belt. Avant was apparently
abandoned by the Neubayern government in 1126 in the
face of heavy raids by New Home.  Avant is now a
buffer zone between new conflict between those two
worlds.

<h4>New Home      </h4>    <B>1117:</B> A565857-D
        <BR><B>1202:</B>  A565859-B         IW<P>

The Island's anglophonic communities have been
unusually aggressive compared to their neighbors
(particularly the francophones), and New Home is no
exception. The local government is still on a
heightened war footing, though more and more of its
resources seem consigned to repairing damage inflicted
by Neubayern and Amondiage commerce raiders. The
regression in tech level has distressed the common
people, and resistance to the planetary government is
rising, leading to an increase in police control.

<h4>Colchis       </h4>    <B>1117:</B> B676898-9
        <BR><B>1202:</B>  C676969-8         IW<P>

Colchis was the sight of major fighting between
factions backed by Amondiage and New Home. After heavy
fighting, New Home's forces won a pyrrhic victory in
1128. The fighting has broken the world economically,
and the local populace has sullenly accepted their
subjugation to NH.

<h4>St.Genevieve  </h4>    <B>1117:</B> C460100-A
        <BR><B>1202:</B>  D460366-8         IW<P>

Despite high temperatures, St.Genevieve attracted
sizeable forces from nearly all of the major factions
in the subsector. The lives of the local fighting men
are extremely miserable, and the "fighting" usually
consists of firing a few rounds over the heads of the
opposing forces. The local desertion rate is high, and
troops are more interested in marking time until their
enlistments run out, or their leaders finally get some
sense and withdraw them from this godforsaken world.
Oddly enough, the civilian population "increases" when
the world is visited by Regency forces or traders, as
small groups of soldiers attempt to steal away on
Regency ships to either their homeworlds or safeside.

<h4>RQB Mitchell  </h4>    <B>1117:</B> E101100-A
      <BR><B>1202:</B>  X101100-A         GA<P>

Formerly known as Achille. Mitchell was apparently a
victim of Viral attack in 1137. The small size of the
facilities, and the uselessness of the world do not
warrant anything more than a small Echelon listening
post to monitor insystem traffic.

<h4>RQB Myers     </h4>    <B>1117:</B> D735764-7
        <BR><B>1202:</B>  D735368-A         GA<P>

Formerly known as St.Denis. Myers is a bonafide
Vampire casualty, no evidence of infection exists,
owing to the low local tech level. Logically this
should have been the end of the RQS mission on the
world, but the facility remains in full operation, and
its mission has never been publicly announced.
