Morninglori has a rotation period of 9 hours. This
forces the population to sleep in shifts, leaving
enough workers to man important industries, but making
certain individuals unavailable even during "daylight"
hours. The population is concentrated in just five
small cities on the main continent, and the outback
and southern continent are largely uninhabited. Most
of the world's income came from trade through its
port, and agriculture.
<P>
During the Psionic Suppressions, a clandestine psionic
institute was discovered in the manor estate of a
local recluse, and its personnel and students were
massacred in a raid by local and subsector
authorities. The Kalavatos institute was reopened
after the Psionic Reforms by a direct decendant of the
manor owner, and now operates openly in the city of
Kator. Psionics are now extremely popular in local
society, and the institute has fostered several local
training schools.
