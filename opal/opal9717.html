Life on this world has always been harsh, and the
colonists that came here thousands of years ago were
known for their ruthlessness and impatience for risks.
Esperanza was home to a sizeable community of Droyne,
who were exterminated by the human colonists in the
first two hundred years of their settlement. After the
eradication of the "Batwings" the world descended into
one brutal dictatorship after another, as local
warlords vied for control of the world. The current
dictatorship was established after the Serendip's
invention of jump drive,  a cruel dictatorship known
as the Lord Protector.  Unlike many dictators, the
local government is more bureaucratic than feudal, but
is also more ideological, and the Lord Protector is
surrounded by a personality cult that borrows heavily
from some debased evangelical tradition.
<P>
The world is heavily industrialised, and the teeming
population is kept in check by an extensive security
service, including the distinctively white robed Civic
Police. Pollution is quite severe, requiring the use
of filter masks at all times.  Food and water
rationing are enforced, and dissent is stifled by a
vertical line of informants and monitors.  The
Esperanzan war effort was an unmitigated disaster,
thanks to poor planning, and the local economy has
limped along since annexation by the Regency.  The
locals no longer have enough money to maintain public
spaces, and the cities and local factories are rubbish
heaps of failing services, sputtering utilities and
dilapidated buildings.  The current Lord Protector,
General Jonathan "Babbling" Brooke, and his cronies
have retreated more and more into fortified dwellings
and communities segregated from the main population.
