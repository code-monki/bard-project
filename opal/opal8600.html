Agdarmi is known as the Blue Marble, in reference to
the forests of blue-green trees that blend in with the
seas, creating a pleasantly textured tableau for the
eye. "A small button of a world, blessed with good
weather and pleasant climate," all of the travel
guides to Zeng have repeated verbatim for centuries.
The warm world is covered in dense forests, where
under the lower gravity, the local trees grown into
giants with trunks almost as wide at the bottom as
they are tall. Because there exists little ground
clearance, most of the worlds ecology has developed at
the treetop levels, creating a world that indulges the
sylvan memories and fantasies of most human visitors.
<P>
Agdarmi was first settled around 200, and it quickly
obtained a reputation as a rest and recreation world.
The high metal content in the soil, and the heavy
forests made the world largely useless for normal
agriculture, but the low concentration also made it
virtually useless for mining operations as well. This
left the local wilderness and ecology virtually
untouched. Eventually starship crews and passengers
passing down the Rift Highway began to go out of the
way to stay on the world for longer than it was
necessary, and hotels and resorts began to sprout up
to cater to this growing traffic.
<P>
The first settlements grew out of the starport,
offering a variety of recreational and entertainment
venues. Because of the dense undergrowth, most are
found near bodies of water, or within the canopy of
the more massive trees. Entire towns in more remote
areas look as if they stepped out of a fairytale, with
spindly walkways suspended between the huge trees,
with moss overgrowing the stairways and guardrails,
overlooking structures that look as if they were built
for creatures not human. Local wood tends to be
useless for buildings and furniture after being cut,
and the locals have perfected the art of sculpting
trees and epiphytes into living furniture or
buildings.
Agdarmians seem to have absorbed their arborieal
surroundings just a little too much. The locals like
to say that no word for propriety exists in the local
dialect. Personal property and space, privacy and self
restraint are weaker concepts on a world where
claustrophobia and dark imaginings are encouraged by
the sylvan setting. The locals are amazingly informal
with each other, to the point of rudeness in the eyes
of most offworlders. Property is often communally
owned, multiple or open marriages tolerated, and
children from such unions create sprawling extended
families. Agdarmians are given to excess in food and
drink during holidays or family celebrations, and
think nothing about moderation, which can lead to
internal feuding and even riots during these times.
