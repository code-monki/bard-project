The Grudovo Pendant is a j-1 cluster of 13 worlds that
connects Tobia/Trojan Reach with neighboring
Usher/Reft. Originally a cluster of little economic
presence or importance, its economic value has risen
in proportion with the rising volume of trade that
passes between Lintl and Tobia.<P>

Despite its seeming attractiveness to offworld
development, the planet formerly known as Our Planet
is home to forests of invasive plant species and
ferocious macrofauna. The few colonists that arrived
here were mostly hunters and conservationists that
subsisted off of whatever they gathered in the
outback, or as guides and outfitters for offworld
hunters. During the Civil War, the locals became
vassals to the Ihatei of the Hreakhari clan, in return
for their patronage and money.  Since the Civil War,
the locals have begun to pool their money and are
slowly expanding their community to attract offworld
immigration.
