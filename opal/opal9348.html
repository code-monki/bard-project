Trafford is one of four worlds that constitute
Foreven's "Football Cluster", a group of four worlds
that were originally settled by Solomani colonists
from Terra's British Isles.
<P>
Geologically the world is dominated by massive plains
and plateaus, with very little surface relief. Its
oceans are shallow, and several are landlocked with no
outlets or outside circulation. As oceans on most
worlds act as heat pumps and chemical absorbers,
Trafford's have a minimal impact upon temperature
regulation or the local CO2 and N2 cycles, due to
their restricted flow.  As a result the local
biosphere has had to adapt in a drastic fashion in
order to compensate.
<P>
During the aphelion sequence, local plant and algal
lifeforms greedily thrive on the nutrients that are
fixed by them directly from the air, or washed out of
air and soil by rain. A massive explosion of
floresence occurs, and the worlds forests and
grasslands are smothered in a heavy tangle of rapid
growing trees and plants.  The atmospheric CO2 levels
drop severely, and the O2 level spikes. As Trafford
swings back towards perhelion, the O2 levels reach
their maximum, and by early autumn combine with the
higher summer temperatures in the Southern Hemisphere
to create massive firestorms that recycle accumulated
carbon and nitrogen back into the ecosystem. The
CO2-N2-H2O levels rise to unbreathable levels,
restarting the cycle.
<P>
Most years these storms are rather localised
outbreaks, but every ten years or so the world can
erupt into massive tornadic "hellstorms" that can
sweep across entire continents in a matter of a few
days or weeks. Hellstorms are massive storm cells,
usually low pressure fronts in the temperate regions
that magnify smaller fires into massive sheets of
advancing, 100 km/hr flame that incinerate everything
in their paths. These storms can last for weeks on
end, and dramatically depopulate entire regions.
<P>
Most local plants have life cycles that rely upon
these firestorms for germination and reproduction.
Many are actually quite flammable, and it's the
population explosion of these species that encourage
the hellstorm phenomenon. Many types of marine algae
develop surface blooms that develop flammability, and
during hellstorms the surface of the local oceans and
lakes can spontaneously ignite in brief, explosive
spurts.
<P>
Given its dangers, and its dramatic shifts in
atmospheric composition from one unbreatheable mix to
another, it seems quite strange that anyone actually
tried to settle this world. But several parts of the
infamous Football Fleet settled the world around 670,
and quickly adapted to its trying environment.  The
settlers were quick to exploit the systems longer
growing season, and deftly manuevering crop
cultivation in the worlds schedule of growth and
destruction. The world is a minor breadbasket system
for Titan subsector, and its most famous products are
dark colored liquers and wines (due to their high
carbon content), and a variety of unusual culinary
products.
<P>
Trafford is dominated by the Combine, a consortium of
farms, corporations and local communities that allied
to create a common legal code, police force and
governing protocols for the entire populace. True to
their feisty ancestors, the locals are to divisive and
disinterested to permit a more cohesive government,
and the Combine itself is little more than a
collection of overglorified clerks and minor
bureaucrats that are accomplished at keeping out of
the way of their more productive bretheren, and do
just enough to keep the world from grinding into
gridlock.
<P>
Trafford was formerly independent, but enjoyed good
relations with the neighboring Avalar Consulate, who
were its main market and patron. Avalar naval patrols
commonly visited the world, and its food, ample liquor
stocks and laid back attitude made a popular shore
leave spot. The Collapse concerned the locals, who
were afraid that the Quarantine would chill their
important export markets, and the world asked for and
recieved membership in the Avalar Consulate in 1133.
 <P>
The local Venues are unusual compared to the Avalar
norm in that they were drawn from the hard-bitten
staffs of the local corporate and agricultural
combines, and have a strong disdain for the prevailing
soft and parasitical lifestyle. Traffordians are
almost obsessive about work and labor, and are
strongly disdainful of sloth and waste.  Success is
the local religion, and entrepenuers with proven
records are considered to be the pinnacle of culture.
Luxury is the result of an honest days work, and the
long ten to twelve hour workday is topped off with
meals prepared with religious fervor. The locals are
accomplished cooks and bon vivants, and Traffordian
cuisine is famous in the Consulate and along the
Zhodani frontier.
<P>
The threat of wildfires and Hellstorms is taken very
seriously by the Traffordians, and goes a long way in
explaining their attitudes.  Most dwellings are built
of stone, reinforced brick, ceramic and steel.
Communities are constructed with high walls designed
to create a deflection layer of air around them. The
areas surrounding them are kept clear of brush and
grass, and are often paved over with gravel or
cobblestones to prevent growth and drain accumulated
rainwater.  Many communities since the Collapse have
been relocated to "stilt cities" built in lakes or
along oceanic coastlines.  Hellstorm season sees a
dramatic tapering off of activity, and the world is
amber zoned during its duration. The locals generally
remain indoors (escept for rescue patrols), passing
the time in semi-festivity. When the Hellstorm season
passes, the population turns out in a massive festival
known as the Turn of Regeneration, a celebration
marked with almost bacchanal intensity.
