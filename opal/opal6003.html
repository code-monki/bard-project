Site of the famous Leenitakot Ringworld, and inspiration for the naming of
the Ring Pact, it's Droyne inhabitants are notoriously easy-going.
Formerly a possession of the Outcasts of the Whispering Sky, it is now the
site of the Ringworld Research Institute, a Pact division. Although
incomplete, the massive structure has plenty of secrets and artefacts to
surprise investigators, many of whom travel from the Federation to
investigate it. The post collapse history of the world is quite similar
to Yoryunssoy's, save for the initial battles against their oppressive
Outcast overlords that wiped them from the face of the planet. It gets
reasonable cross-trade from Gammist to the Strom Cluster and the far end
of the Elan Main, and is more open about Psionic training then their
brothers, but less accomplished.
