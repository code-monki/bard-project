This world was an important producer of merchant vessels before the collapse, but
it was hit hard by a Solomani strike during the Black War, destroying the starport and 
it's surrounds. The <A HREF="../peri/peri0007.html">VTA</A> has attempted to recover jump drive production machinery from
the world, but has only retrieved old field re-alignment equipment. This is currently
being installed at Dycarl's starport, and will enable it to carry out quicker drive 
maintenance. The planet exports agricultural products, pharmaceuticals, and Droyne goods.
There are a large amount of Droyne Technicians from this world working at the Starport 
and Scout Base on Voskl, where they are performing apparent miracles refurbishing old
starships. The Starport was almost completely built by Voskl.
