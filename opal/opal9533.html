 I've written more
section covering the most interesting worlds of the
Spinward Marches, and a few worlds you don't want to
visit, except when you have a gun pointed at your
head.  Many of the write ups are based on information from <cite>GURPS Traveller: Behind the Claw</Cite>
<P><B>
Attica/Querion (SM 0414):</B> In spite of Attica's
location on the border with the Zhodani Consulate, or
perhaps because of it, the world was vehemently
Anti-Psionic and Anti-Zhodani before the Collapse. The
success of the Regency's Psionic Reforms caused a
change in local opinions about psionics, but it has
hardened towards the Zhodani. The world should be
considered an Amber Zone for Zhodani, though this is
only a problem if they ignore local restrictions. For
no Zhodani is allowed to land in the downport. A
neutral world since its colonisation in the 570s,
Attica's prejudices have hurt its reputation in the
Regency, and the world mostly gets by economically
through trade with the Federation of Arden.
<P><B>
Dekalb/Querion (SM 0618):</B> This metal-rich waterworld
has no significant land surfaces other than a few
coral atolls. Most of the population lives on large
mining platforms constructed in shallow parts of the
world-ocean. These platforms average about 25,000 to
40,000 people in population, and are constructed with
landing platforms so that ships can land directly to
ship the extracted ore for processing and export. The
main downport is located in a sheltered cove set in a
coral reef. The world is ruled by a bureaucracy made
up of senior rig personnel, and is divided
accordingly.
<P><B>
Drolraw/Lunion (SM 2426):</B> If you have no good reason
to visit here, don't try coming up with one. Drolraw's
atmosphere is poisonous sulfur trioxide at a very high
pressure. SO<sub>3</sub> is a precursor to sulfuric acid, and can
transform into it in the presence of water. If that
weren't bad enough, the world is very geologically
unstable, and active volcanos and earthquakes punish
the surface regularly. Aside from a SuSAG
manufacturing complex, the world has no appeal, except
to the suicidal.
<P><B>
Entrope/Querion (SM 0720):</B> "When elephants fight, it
is the grass that suffers." The wars between the
Darrians and the Sword Worlds had left this place in
pretty sorry shape by the Civil War period. The
outsystem is littered with the debris of past battles,
and the local infrastructure had been shattered so
many times that the natives had pretty much given up
at trying to keep up with upkeep.  The populace was so
desperate in the wake of the world's final liberation
from the Sword Worlds that it installed a popular
dictatorship in an effort to effect rebuilding.
Reconstruction has been very successful, but the
dictatorship has become a hereditary post for the
Yoldat family.  Resistance to this increasingly
unnecessary regime is so far muted, but widespread.
<P><B>
Fiashzaikriq/Querion (SM 0613):</B> Formerly known as
Lebeau. Fiashzaikriq is a college planet, containing
the largest Zhodani university in the Marches. The
University of Fiashzaikriq is a well rounded learning
institution, but since the Collapse its psionic and
cultural studies departments have become very
important to relations with the Regency. A great many
Regency students and academics come here on exchange
or sabbatical. The planetary government is controlled
by the University Council of Governors, a council of
12 nobles, usually of impeccable academic background.
Outside of the university, the population practices
simple agriculture and animal husbandry.
<P><B>
Fen's Gren/Mora (SM 3228):</B> Another vacation spot for
the masochistic. The "Gren's" atmosphere contains
microscopic parasites that invade the human
respiratory system, and cause a disease that is nearly
one hundred percent fatal.  Those unlucky enough to
live here subsist on agriculture for export to Mora. The local Chirper population is
immune to the parasite.
<P><B>
Forine/Plankwell (SM 1533):</B> Forine's antebellum
"tourist brochures" (the official propaganda)
advertised the fact that the world was supposedly
covered in a massive world covering arcology. In
reality the population lives in a massive potemkin
village, where the "arcology" is nothing more than
props and empty structures designed to create more
bulk than actually exists. The local dictatorship is a
hereditary government known as the Council of Swords,
ruled by a self-styled "Sword Lord" and his "Sword
Masters."  Despite the grandiose titles and overblown
ambitions, they do an adequate job of providing
services and maintaining public trust. The Swords were
actually quite friendly with the Third Imperium, but
political tensions with the Sword Worlders prevented
them from actually joining. Forine's tech level has
progressed enough to make it attractive to offworld
trade. Cheap electronic components are the main
export.
<P><B>
Ivendo/Lanth (SM 2319):</B> Ivendo is home to the Ranage
Tree. The Ranage is an essential part of the local
ecology, and is abundant in the world's forests.
Unfortunately, its pollen contains an alkaloidal toxin
that is deadly to humans, and when the trees are
pollinating during the spring, filter masks are
required for the duration of the "bitchin' ragweed"
season. The Ranage is cut down by the locals for the
manufacture of exquisite furniture and cabinetry that
is a major export of the world.
<P><B>
Mercury/Mora (SM 2624):</B> The naval and scout bases on
this world are primarily for training. RQS and Marine
personnel have access to a variety of facilities
designed to mimic the various planetary conditions
that they may encounter in the course of their tours.
Large parts of the world are reserved as training
ranges, and are offlimits to unauthorised personnel
and civilians. Mercury handles all training for
Regency Ranger and Hammerhead personnel as well, at
high security facilities placed in orbit, and dirtside
in the planets equatorial region.
<P><B>
Overnale/Glisten (SM 1937):</B> Overnale is a rich
agricultural world that produces several distinguished
products. It is most famous for Ufflewine, a dark
wine-like beverage made from the native Uffleberry.
The world's main exports are meat and hides, as its
open plains are home to large ranches.
<P><B>
Raydrad/Trin's Shroud (SM 2933):</B> Raydrad is another
agricultural world famous for its alcoholic beverages.
In this case a golden liquid known as Ricernay, the
drink of masochists. Raydrad's atmosphere and ecology
is host to a number of severe allergens, and Ricernay
itself will cause severe reactions in about one-third
of all people who drink it. Oddly enough, afficionados
take this as a sign of its authenticity, as if
anaphylactic shock actually has a silver lining.
Raydrad is a backwater, and few people aside from
traders ever visit the place.
<P><B>
Talchek/Plankwell (SM 1631):</B> Talchek and nearby
Elixabeth are colonies of Forine.  Each world has a
Sword Lord governor that reports back to the main
government on Forine, but are generally more free and
less oppressive. Neither world, however, is a garden
spot. Talchek's fluorine and hydrofluoric acid
atmosphere are quite dangerous to work and fly in, and
supposedly the antebellum amber zone was to reflect
this fact. In reality, as on Wypoc/Lanth, the Imperium
used the world to conceal its military operations, in
this case a laboratory for the manufacture of
biological weaponry. In the fallout of the Collapse
the Regency shut the facility down, and pulled out.
Talchek's main industries are all chemical, utilising
the highly acidic atmosphere for a number of important
processes. Talchek also has the remains of an old
Darrian gas refinery that were built around -1000, and
are now preserved as a historical site.
<P><B>
Tondoul/Five Sisters (SM 0739):</B> Tondoul is home to
another group of humans transplanted by the Ancients.
The Ancient base was located on the worlds moon, now a
pretty dramatic ring structure. The population
subsisted in several underground communities powered
by simple yet very reliable energy and life support
machinery. IISS contacted the world in a timely
fashion, arriving just as these machines were failing.
Tondoul does not have an Ancient site rating in its
listing because the scouts largely stripped all of the
artifacts out and replaced them with equipment of
Imperial manufacture. Unlike the Traltar, the
Tondoulians have mixed heavily with Imperial
immigrants and possess a culture that incorporates
elements from both groups.
<P><B>
Traltha/Trin's Shroud (SM 2834):</B>  Traltha's desert
status is a side effect of damage dealt to it during
the Ancient's Final War. The local seas were
apparently blasted into space by a massive bolide that
was targeted against the world by an Ancient strike
force. The Ancient base included a population of
transplanted humans, the majority of which survived
the strike, and somehow scratched out a living in the
outback. Calling themselves the Traltar, these desert
nomads used to scour the outback for surviving water
sources. After contact with the Third Imperium in 373,
they accepted offworld technological aid, and quit
their wandering for a more sedentary existence. Most
of their communities are located around wells, and
subsist upon agriculture. The Traltar have a long
running fight with another local, non-sentient lizard
species known as the Vorstin, which has a nasty habit
of raiding their communities for water.  Local pride
prevented them from accepting offworld military aid in
the past, but the world's technology has advanced to
the point that the locals can now manufacture their
own laser weaponry, giving them a decisive advantage.
<P><B>
Zeykiede/Cronor (SM 0101):</B> The entire population of
this world lives on huge mining and manufacturing
crawlers that scour this mineral rich world for
resources to be made in to exportable products. These
roving communities are technically answerable to no
one, and the sole governing authority is a council
that runs the downport.
