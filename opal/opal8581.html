Homeworld of the Endimyonite Minor Race, or the
Arkaeides as they call themselves. The Arkaeides are
massive quadrupedal centaurs, looking both lizardish
and insectoid in appearance. They are also one of the
largest sentient races ever discovered, ranging up to
three meters in length for a full grown adult, and up
to 4000 kg in mass. They live in the world's steamy
swamps, living on paddy agriculture and swimmers
raised in pens. Arkaeides are a gerontocracy of sorts,
as the species lives up to 300 standard years. Status
is accorded to size, as the race grows througout their
lives.  The larger the individual, the more status
they are accorded, and the rulers are corpulent and
massive creatures according to observers. The world is
interdicted, as per Regency Law, by the RISS, who
maintains a pair of scout cruisers in orbit at all
times to prevent offworld contact.
