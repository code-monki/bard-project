Taupi is pronounced as the Greek letters Tau-Pi.  The
CO<sub>2</sub> shrouded world was settled as a mining colony in
the latter days -1100s by Darrian mining companies
intent upon exploiting its Osmium and Iridium deposits
for export back to the Confederation.  As such it was
the furthest of the Darrian's possessions from the
homeworld. Because of the distance involved, and the
world's hardships, workers were rotated in on seasonal
half-year shifts.  In later years, an overlapping
shift structure of four work shifts per year was
maintained, two on the planet at the same time but
with different arrival and departure schedules.

<P>
Taupi's B and C shifts were present when the Maghiz
knocked out the Confederation.  Part of the relieving
D shift had also just arrived.  The three groups
waited in vain for their reliefs and supply vessels to
return, before giving up and falling back upon their
own resources. The miners were fortunate, as their
fellows at <a href="opal9506.html">Saxe</A>, in that the TL-16 facilities would
run indefinitely throughout their isolation and the
Imperial period.  Food was in short supply, and the
colony only had two emergency jump capable craft that
could not be wasted on a risky recontact expedition to
the homeworlds.

<P>
They made a few tentative contacts with neighboring
worlds, including Urnian, and used its ships to trade
minerals for vital supplies.  Eventually the ships
wore out, and the Taupians became reliant on either
<a href="opal9309.html">Urnian</A> or the local corsairs to carry their shipments.
For their part, the two parties made their own demands
on the locals, which always entailed the basing of
their ships for smuggling and pirate operations along
the Urnian-Five Sisters interface. Close ties were
established with the Mainap pirates, who used the
world as an additional safehouse to duck Imperial
naval and scout patrols.

<P>
Recontact with the Confederation did not go as smooth
as the locals hoped. As with Saxe, the Confederation
no longer had the ability to repair, maintain or
construct TL-16 materials or machinery.  Nor did
technicians who could understand old schematics still
exist.  The domes that housed the population slowly
began to fail about five hundred years ago, forcing
the steady consolidation of the colony into domes
still operational, and encouraging greater
prostitution to local criminal syndicates. An Amber
Zone rating was imposed to reflect the world's
desperate conditions, criminal violence and increasing
despair.

<P>
Fortunately there was a happy ending. As the Regency
and the Darrian Confederation began to master TL-16
construction, they intervened on the behalf of both
Saxe and Taupi, helping to rebuild the facilities, and
launching uplift programs to educate and train the
locals in self-governance.  The Amber Zone remains in
place, however, due to lingering ties with local
pirates, and the growing influence of the Enterprise.
