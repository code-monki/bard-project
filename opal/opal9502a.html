<B>ULTRA SECRET </B><BR>
<B>From</B>:Cmmdr Wafoua Syoisuis : 49th Squadron  23rd Fleet Gerome Quarantine	253-1199<br>
<B>To</B>: Vice Admiral Goron Amdon :  Chief of Naval Intelligence 23rd Fleet<br>

	My congratulations on your recent promotion, I look forward to working
with you again.  I have been asked by your predeccesor to bring you up to date
on the situation on Gerome.  We have recently created and released a RICE Paper
for public dissemination.  This paper creates a cover story that Gerome has become infected with a dangerous symbiote, of human creation.  For those suspicious individuals in the press and other organizations we have created false
evidence that the base on Gerome was researching biological warfare agents,
in violation of Emperor Martin III's edict.  There is nothing concrete, just
enough to suggest.  Hopefully this way suspicious individuals will be
diverted from the truth.  <P>

	The actual story is not that much different than the official story.
In 945 a research base was established on Gerome, not to study biological
improvements, but the geneering of psionic individuals.   The base took
several years to get established, in its early years it did not make much
progress.  It made a few minor improvements to psi drugs and psionic shielding,
but nothing major.   During the Fourth Frontier War, dozens on noble Zhodani
were captured and shipped to Gerome.  These individuals provided a large
group of psions who shared a common gene pool.   These specimens showed the
researchers new approaches to their problem.  In 1088 the Beta Epsilon
batch of test subjects was conceived.  By 1102 an above average number of
specimens showed psionic awareness.  The Beta Zeta and Beta Eta batches also
showed increased numbers of psions with increased strengths and variety
of psionic abilities.  The Beta Theta batch had to be destroyed, due to
an unforeseen mutation.  The Beta Iota batch was decanted in 1130, by 1139
the group was showing unheard of levels of psionic abilities.  Seventy
five percent were psioniclly  active, with psionic strengths of five to
ten, with three cases of strengths of 18.  The Beta Kappa and Beta Lambda
batches were rushed into production.  During the summer of 1148 the Beta
Iota individuals, turned 18.  In the next year they started to show signs
of mental instabilities. 			<P>

	The researchers carefully watched the Beta Kappa and Beta Lambda
 groups. Both groups showed immense psionic strengths, and not just in
the common psionic abilities, but in many different Arcane abilities.
Unfortunetly they also developed mental instabilities, even earlier than
in the Beta Iota group.  These include megalomania, paranoia, schizophrenia,
autism, mental retardation, multiple personality disorder and obsessive
compulsive behavior.  Production of the Beta Mu and Beta Nu batches were
immediately halted, while a solution was sought. <P>

	The researchers only had 6 months, before the Betas created their
own solution.  Led by a Beta Iota named Alexandra, they revolted.  Most
of the researchers were killed, the remaining were captured and held as
hostage.  Some of the Betas wanted to trade the hostages for a ship in which
they would roam the galaxy.  Alexandra put a halt to this talk by
incinerating the group's chief spokesman.  She then declared herself Emperor
of the Known Universe, and ordered a halt to contact with the "...mind deaf
Imperials."  She ordered that the Beta Mu, and Beta Nu batches be put into
production, and she ordered the creation of a Beta Xi group, which
consisted entirely of clones of herself.  Alexandra suffered from megalomania
and paranoia, a particularly dangerous combination in a leader, especially
when the leader  is a telepathic pyrotechnic.<P>

	The Commodore of  the orbiting squadron was on planet during the
revolt and was executed by Emperor Alexandra personally.  There was
quite a debate among the surviving Naval captains on how to react to
the revolt.  Some wanted to act with massive force and crush the planet.
Others wanted to mount a rescue attempt, and then crush the planet.  A
few wanted to negotiate a settlement.  Finally a rescue attempt was
decided on.  The attempt was a dismal failure.  Two companies of assault
marines landed on the planet.  Though equipped with battle dress with
integral psionic shielding, the marines were butchered by the psions.
Psionic shielding only slows down a strength 15 psion, and it does nothing
against telekinetic wielded plasma guns.<P>

	Upon hearing of the defeat, Subsector Command issued orders calling
for a temporary quarantine of the planet.  After several months of debate,
it was ordered that the quarantine be made permanent, and the planet kept
under constant surveillance.  It was thought that the undesirable mental traits would be winnow ed from the gene pool, by natural selection.   Even if this did not happen, the Navy would be able to study to see the long term biological effects of psionics. <P>

	The quarantine is maintened by the 49th Squadron of the 23rd Regency
Fleet.  The planet is monitored by a series of orbiting satellites.  Yearly,
missions to the planet are mounted, These are crewed solely by remotely
controlled robots.  Each robot has a self destruct mechanism, in case a
psion with machine empathy manages to take control of the robot.  These
missions trade needed resources for information that can not be gathered
from orbit.  Some complexes await the missions with anticipation, others
try to destroy the missions, for what ever goals they might have.
Occasionally the missions capture a psion and bring back the specimen for
in depth analysis.  The 49th Squadron if fairly strong. That is both to
keep intruders out of the system, and also to keep the Betas from escaping.
In 1183 the Beta group known as the Avengers of Korn tried to launch a
small solid fuel rocket into orbit.  The cruiser <I>Cranston</I> was able to destroy
it, but several psions were able to teleport to the <I>Cranston</I>, they caused
extensive damage before being eliminated.  <P>

	Since the revolt, life has not been good for the inhabitants of Gerome.
It is standard procedure for experimental geneered individuals to be sterilized
at birth. This way the gene pool is strictly controlled by the scientists in
charge.  Early Betas such as individuals from the Beta Beta and Beta Gamma
batches, were used as lab assistants at the research base.  These
individuals were able to create new batches of Betas, which were fully
fertile.   The other major problem for the Betas was food.  Most food
for the research was grown on planet, but it required a great deal of
foreign assistance.  After several lean years, the Betas were able to
create a stable food supply.   Though it is precarious and does not
make for a varied diet.   				<P>

	The society of the psions is quite chaotic, as fits a mentally
unstable population.  The population consists of approximately 12,000
individuals.  These are gathered into 12 major groups of about 800 psions
each, and 25 minor groups of varying size.  Each group does not possess
enough food, manufacturing, medical and technological resources to be self
sufficient.  Most groups trade to get access to the neccesary resources.
A few, especially of the smaller bands, resort to raiding, and banditry.
Local manufacturing is at TL 8, with large amounts of high tech equipment
still on planet.  The structure of each of these bands is quite varied,
some are democratic, some are ruled by self proclaimed Queens, Dalis,
Gods, and Lord Emperors, others are simply ruled by the strongest.
The clones of Emperor Alexandra have created a complex inhabited solely
by clones of the original Alexandra, who is kept alive in low berth.
It is considered one of the more insane complexes.  Due to the sheer
number of sociopaths, violent crime is epidemic, most groups have
incorporated this into their society, through ritual challenges,
registered assassins and blood duels.  	<P>

The Navy has built a small repair facility base, to help maintain
the quarantine.  The base possess two flights of Rampart fighters.
The 49th Squadron consists of 5 SEH (Starburst of Extreme Heroism)
 Light Cruisers. They are the <I>Cranston</I>, the <I>Bainbridge</I>, the <I>Dzaekh</I>,
 the <I>Ying Zhou</I> and the <I>Dirk Teledon</I>.  For details of the SEH Light
Cruiser see the Rebellion Source book.<P>
