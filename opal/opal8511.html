New Ramma suffers from severe seismic stress. Thrust
faults create huge block like mountains that loom over
the surrounding countryside. These same tectonic
stresses create deep rifts where most of the worlds
surface water can be found. Between these two extremes
exist deep valleys filled with alluvium washed down
out of the mountains by seasonal rains. In antebellum
times, grasslands filled these valleys, and most of
the population lived in scattered ranches, raising
cattle and other commercial herd animals.
<P>
The Abandonment brought a massive influx of refugees
from Borlund/Lamas that increased the population
almost a hundred fold. Most of the ranches were
supplanted by commercial grain farming, and the
population is now dominated by mountaintop towns and
settlements that overlook the most productive farming
areas. The world's low law level reflects the original
planetary governments live and let live philosophy;
the newer community governments have been less
tolerant of the worlds longstanding gun culture, and
weapons are controlled or banned in several regions.
The main starport and Scout Base are located on the
moon of Ammon, a small planetoid about 80,000 miles
away from the surface.
