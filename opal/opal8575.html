Vanzeti is an oddball.  The world's continental crust
never developed, and most of the original atmosphere
leaked into space. Freezing temperatures at night
dessicate the atmosphere of moisture, making it
difficult to breathe with normal respirators. The
world ocean is lifeless, and is black colored due to
low oxygen levels. In spite of its unattractiveness, a
scout base was constructed here in 1042 for
coordinated training operations with the facility on
nearby Cabrini.  A strange sect known colloquially as
the Googles, espousing a mixture of libertarian and
anarchist practices, migrated here from Thingen in
1088.  The group settled in a number of seafloor domed
cities, but the life support upkeep of these
settlements caused power to concentrate in the hands
of factions that controlled power generation and
support plants, marring its utopian pretensions.
