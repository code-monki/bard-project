A near desert world, abundant in rare minerals and petrochemicals, it
was well defended through the collapse as it managed to keep the Virus
out of its main systems, including it's Naval Base. It used it's 
resources to defend the cluster of worlds around it, and helped 
stabilise events on it's neighbour system of Leroy, which had descended
into anarchy when the Colonial Rule from Vanguardia collapsed. <P>

The 
ruling elite soon realised that the technology that they could so 
freely obtain in the pre-virus years could not be maintained for
long with their pre-stellar technology. They set in motion several 
programs. First was a technology exchange program with Leroy, which 
in concert with a social program at home to promote the sciences 
aised it's tech level to 9 by 1142. The third program involved attempts
at recovering higher technology from the previously more advanced 
worlds in the subsector.<P>

 One consequence of this was that worlds where 
recovery of items was possible were claimed by Strom. This put them at
odds with Leroy, which had a very anti-colonial attitude. Items 
recovered from the dead world of Elan raised Strom's tech level to A 
in 1161, but the dearth of any moderately populated former tech B 
worlds held them back. Basic research, and information and technology 
recovered from Brand allowed the world to progress to TL-B in 1189, a 
year prior to the foundation of the Ring Pact. <P>

The foundation of the 
pact, with the rise in importance of diplomacy and trade, allied with 
the primacy of academia led to the re-organisation of the government 
as a representative democracy in 1192. She hopes to be the first Pact 
world to manufacture a Jump-capable ship, and has a joint programme 
underway with Leroy on this matter. She sees the attainment of higher 
technical achievement as vital to the future, as she is not the most 
populous world in the Pact by any means.<P>

 There is a Hiver Technical 
Academy on this world. The current leader is Premier Valdan Kermski, 
the tough talking leader of the Concert party. His aims are to achieve 
greater gains for the pact through joint actions. He is opposed by 
the Destiny Alliance, which believes that actions, as long as they 
are not inimical to their neighbours, should be taken for Strom's 
purposes alone. Jenna Stromsweld is soft-spoken leader of this party. 
Analysts think that Strom will be able to achieve a TL of C in the 
next few years.<P>
