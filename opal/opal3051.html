Kata's TED, "The Warlord", is actually the descendant of the Imperial Noble family that used to dwell here as  their fief. During the hard Times, Tech fell to 9, and caused a crises of government. The Warlord, Count Enligii Huunzaakata united the world in a militaristic fashion. Tech decline to 6 during Virus & the 2nd long night was due to lack of outside trade, and the destruction of the A-class starport as the Solomani retracted back rimward through the subsector in 1119.
	<P>
The Warlord is currently a woman, Countess Pisadora Huunzaakata IV. Recognizing the threat an orbital bombardment could mean, it was easier to acquiesce to Solee's & GALINES ships than to buck them, she figured, after having a "discussion of terms" with KDR Baron Amaan Abas of Solee. And the advantages of selling her surplus produce & TL-6 weaponry meant a steady income from off world trade. Though her family's fiefdom is the same, having it re-affirmed by the Empress of Solee has given her faltering, corrupt regime new life. A burgeoning middle class is emerging, along with other issues she'd rather ignore. Having  up graded her defenses as part of "re-opening trade" certainly has worked to her benefit & increased the loyalty in her troops to her. TKHL personnel maintain Kata's D-class starport planetside, with locals hired in the food & entertainment industries (Infiltrated by The Countess' spies, of course!).
Countess Pisadora liked the deal under the DAG  polity a lot better than the "Soleean occupation" she endures now, but since a lot of her  troops are being trained by off-worlders, she has to watch her step. Several TEDs on Marcena & Hindahl learned it the hard way about taking Solee's shilling, and crossing them afterwards, a fact that KDR-Baron Amaan Abas surely pointed out to her.

 These forces are here as part of the Co-prosperity-Trade agreement, to defend the system & augment Countess Huunzaakata's forces against outside attack. Thanatos, Jump-1 rimward of here, is a buyer for Kata's surplus foodstuffs as well, being primarily a Mining system.

The xenophobia was higher, but the trade seems to be smoothing that out. That, and the law level has slackened a little.

<B>Notes:</B> The Solee Empire maintains bases on Tosho and Zama.<P>
The Research base on Zama was owned by SuSAG, LIC in Precollapse times has been re-opened by CZERNIAK & GALINES' versions of this latter day Corporation. Gene research was being conducted here. Whatever they've discovered, its up to the GM to determine.
