<P>

Shortcut is as dry as a bleached bone. In fact it
gleams like a bone, for much of its lowlands are
streaked with extensive beds of yellow-white
evaporites like gypsum, powdery limestones and various
salts, a relic of its watery past. Huge canyons of
layered rock, carved by the wind, scar its face. Very
little life remains on the world, and water is
difficult to extract from its stony deserts.
<P>
But Shortcut still managed to attract settlement. The
world's harsh environment coupled with its prime
location near the Avalar Consulate attracted many free
traders, pirates, mercenaries and smugglers. These
various groups tussled over the scarce resources, and
for control over the system, until the different
groups created a unified system of guilds that managed
competition.
<P>
Under the laws of these guilds, there existed no laws
except a man's conscience.  Weapons were cheap and
easy to obtain. An organised system of duelling and
assassination became the main means of settling
disputes or righting grievances, though the guilds
that managed to avoid becoming entangled within too
many duel wars managed to climb to the top of the
pile.
<P>
Visitors to the world before the Collapse were quickly
made aware that all business on the world had to be
done through a guild.  Every guild had a specialty,
and a monopoly over that specialty, and they had the
right, nay the imperative, to defend their monopoly
against outside competition by any means available to
them. Unfortunately, outsiders had to find a sponsor
in order to become a part of the guild, and could only
be accomplished through practically selling yourself
into bondage for a guild lord and his or her
subordinates.
<P>
The methods of the guilds always skirted the law as it
was defined by its Avalaran neighbors, and the world
was a frequent target of naval sweeps and punitive
operations.  For its part the Shortcut guilds
encouraged free trade through its very large port by
allowing no guild a monopoly over interstellar
commerce. To further tweak the Consulate authorities,
"guides" and protection were offered to non-Avalaran
merchants that operated in abeyance of Consulate
customs. An ugly cycle soon developed, with the
Consulate escalating and intensifying its patrols and
raids, and the guilds further refining their smuggling
and piracy tactics in response.
<P>
Unfortunately for the guilds, the Collapse
precipitated their downfall. Citing a clear and
present danger to the Consulate and charted space, the
Avalar Navy began a blockade in 1132, and lasted until
the world's capitulation in 1137. An Avalar military
garrison was emplaced to patrol the world, and the
guilds were forced to create an actual legitmate
government. It also exposed free traders to onerous
Quarantine guidelines that were selectively enforced
as the Consulate authorities deemed it applicable.
<P>
But in the Post-Collapse period the economic payoff of
free enterprise has loosened the morals and principles
of the Consulate to a great degree, and this is
especially evident on Shortcut.  While the guilds have
been forced to restrain and govern themselves, and to
break up the original monopolies in favor of
competitive trade, the original networks still exist
under joint local-Avalaran control.  With the rise of
the competing Enterprise in neighboring Beyond Sector,
the Consulate decided that it needed a few thieves of
its own to maintain their economic edge within their
local sphere of space, and as a result a number of
semi-legal joint ventures exist between the locals and
a number of Avalaran business and bureaucratic
interests with the full blessing of the Consulate
government.
<P>
As in the past, outsiders must work their way up to
the demands of the local bosses, but it now includes
the string of subservience to shadowy elements of the
Consulate government and underworld.  Most free
traders manage to avoid any involvement with these
elements, thanks to Zhodani and Regency pressure to
keep the port free of their influence.
