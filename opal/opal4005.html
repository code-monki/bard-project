A former TL-13 high population, industrial world, Forward was one of only three
in the subsector.  As the Hard times fell it too experience a decline in port 
and technology. It was one of the core worlds of the Khavle Accordment. When 
Virus came, the world was able to hold on a bit longer then Khavle due to the 
fact that most of its critical system where now down to TL-8 standard but it 
one the less eventually fell. Like Khavle it too suffered from economic woes 
and undertook to freeze part of its population although at a smaller rate due 
to the lower local technology which forced the construction of a few higher 
tech factories in order to produce the necessary  hibernation and support 
equipment. This was done with help for Khavle. The current  cryogenic 
population numbers around 2.5 million, the facilities are a mixture of 
TL-8-10 construction.
