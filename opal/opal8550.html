Errogel had always relied upon the Imperial Navy for
its livelihood. The local naval base was a logistical
facility constructed to assist in the movement of
supplies and reinforcements to the Spinward Marches in
the event of hostilities against the Zhodani. Hundreds
of thousands of workers were employed by the base for
ship maintenance, supply handling and various other
support and logistical operations. When the Regency of
Deneb contracted its trailing border in the
Abandonment during the 1130s, the admiralty decided
that the base was too large to dismantle or destroy,
but to valuable to leave to the tender mercies of
Vampire Fleets, and a large guard force remained
behind, even after most of the workforce had been
evacuated. After the Rape of Trin, the Regency
reoccupied some Wildside systems, in the form of a
permanent naval presence, and the Errogel base was
partially reactivated. The base is currently the
headquarters of the 269th Fleet, a unit dedicated to
intelligence gathering in Trailing Deneb and Corridor
sectors.

Errogel is hot and almost completely dry. The world
is tidally locked around the largest gas giant,
Kigashige, and most of the population lives on the
darkside, where temperatures are fairly moderate.
Water collects in a few areas of the darkside, and
most population centers are located near these
valuable reservoirs. The navy base itself is located
near a large manmade water body known as Lake Plocken,
which is now used by the locals to raise dark-loving
aquatic life for consumption.
