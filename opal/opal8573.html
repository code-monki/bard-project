Musayid is a humid world with violent weather
patterns. Evaporation rapidly cycles water from the
surface into the atmosphere, until the carrying
capacity of the thin air is exceeded and the moisture
is release into huge downpours. This turns an
otherwise arid world into a steaming jungle and rain
forest. Colonisation came around 350, mostly Solomani
humans of East Indian and South Asian descent. Over
the intervening centuries, these divided into small,
isolated groups that scratched out a living from
upland agriculture and herding. "Tribal" warfare was
endemic, with each community sending out militias
skilled in tracking and ambush. Eventually this
warfare became as much a ritual of existence as a
necessary means of survival.
<P>
At the top of this melee emerged leaders that called
themselves "Rajah" and who spent their time playing
the tribes off against one another, and extorting
money from offworld merchants in the form of high
tariffs. They encouraged the isolation of their world,
keeping the interior tribes in a state of isolation
and primitive development. Some Rajahs were not above
seizing entire ships and their crews, and forcing
their captives, or their relatives and companies, to
pay massive ransoms. Corporate emissaries and contact
teams had a bad habit of being kidnapped or
disappearing, and mercs were often sent in to rescue
them.
<P>
In 898 a certain Cantor Sullashi, a political
adventurer from Core, arrived here at the head of his
own mercenary force, many of whom were veterans of
previous campaigns against the Rajah. Exceeding the
Imperial Rules of War a bit, Sullashi cowed the Rajah
into surrender after pointing the weapons of his ships
at the poor fellow's palace. Despite his meager
previous qualifications and lack of official Imperial
recognition, Sullashi quickly consolidated his control
over the world, and ended most of the previous Rajah's
tyrannical practices. He and his heirs gradually won
over the scattered and isolated nations through
careful diplomacy, and ended the fratricidal wars
encouraged by the old regime. Through freer trade and
the end of the wars, the local standard of living has
steadily grown ever since.
<P>
Respecting the traditions and culture of their
subjects, the Sullashis prohibit offworld contact
beyond the downport. Offworld traders had to have
special permission and vetting from the Rajah or his
senior officials before they were permitted to trade
beyond the extrality zone. The Representational
Reforms ended this practice, but exclusionary rules
are still in effect for most of the world. Normal
noncommercial contact is freely permitted, though the
planetary government will not guarantee the safety of
private individuals travelling without escort in the
interior.
