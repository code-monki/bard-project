Zephyr is a near water world famous for its powerful
wind currents, and its reliance on large wind-driven
gliders and sailing ships for trade and contact. The
world has a short, 14 hour day that gives it a
perpetual wind speed of around 40-60 kph at all times,
and makes its jet stream move at about twice the
T-Norm level (about 120-150 kph).

 <P>
The wind doesn't pose much of a danger during the
equinoctial seasons, though it can reach gale force
proportions during the winter and summer. It does
disrupt the formation of low pressure systems, and
makes rain less common than normal, and tropical
storms and hurricanes are unheard of. Wind erosion is
more important than weathering by rain, and much of
the land is sculpted by blowing sand and wind.

 <P>
The lack of moisture coupled with wind damage were
severe disincentives to settlement, and it was only in
the early centuries of the Imperial period that a
colony was planted on the world.  Zephyr has few
resources to trade anyway, as most of the world is
steepe and desert unsuitable for agriculture, and few
minerals or ores in large enough concentrations for
mining.

 <P>
Most of the inhabitants rely upon fishing the
estaurine seas, and herding of hardy local grazing
animals known as the Gurpy.  These activities require
a semi-nomadic lifestyle, and most of the population
away from the starport are transients who move in
deference to the seasons.  The fisherman live in large
barges that anchor in sheltered coves and bays, and
send out small catamaran fishing boats into the
surrounding waters to harvest edible and commercially
viable sea life. The Gurpy herders live in gypsy-like
caravans of small trucks and wagons that roam over the
world's two solitary continents.

 <P>
The starport is a rather sumptous B-class facility
that services the steady flow of trade between the
Regency interface, Floria , the Hierate and the
Marrekesh Trade League. What industry that exists on
the world is based in the starports periphery, and
most of it supports the port, and supplies worlds two
main cultures materials unavailable through their own
means.  But a significant portion of that industry is
oriented towards the "windtrade", and is what gives
the world its fame.

 <P>
Because of the dry prevailing conditions on the
continents, there is little cover to absorb solar
radiation and lower the world's albedo.  The bare
ground reflects that heat into the air,  creating
convection thermals that, when combined with the
already massive energy in the atmosphere, create
updrafts of up to hurricane force.  These thermals can
attain heights as great as 15,000 meters, and the
locals exploit this phenomenon through the use of
massive glider aircraft called "323s".

 <P>
Most commerce and trade between the scattered
communities is accomplished through aerial networks of
these gliders.  Since gliders are rather simple to
construct and maintain compared to conventional
aircraft, most communities can afford even mid-sized
versions for their own personal use. Where on other
worlds the young are trained in driving or
grav-flying, the local adolescents are instructed in
unpowered flight.  Gliders are often supplemented with
imported airfoil blimps that do weather and navigation
surveillance work, and by CG powered airframes used by
the local militia.

 <P>
More extreme practitioners of the sailplane set often
create their own wings out of ultralights, parafoils,
and man-pack balloons.  These daredevils, most of whom
are offworld visitors, will tether themselves to one
of these contraptions, along with airtanks and
ballast, and shoot off into the breeze during the
solstice periods of maximum wind.  These "condors" try
to set distance, speed and endurance records,
oftentimes with some loss of life.
