Robalin is about ninety-three percent water by surface
composition.  Nearly all of its population lives on
three small continents, and various scattered island
chains, located within its broad tropical belts. Cool
temperatures, and the lack of arable land makes dry
land agriculture difficult and uneconomical.  This has
driven the creation and maintainment of an extensive
aqualculture industry that is unrivalled in expanse
among any other Consulate world.  More than eighty
percent of the world's primary, and about fifty
percent of its secondary, industries depend upon or
are based at sea.
<P>
The world's oceans are unusually deep, thanks to
massive seafloor rifting and tectonic motion.  High
tectonic mobility has encouraged aquatic evolution,
and the world's undersea biological diversity is rich
and extensive.  Most of the population's food either
comes from sea harvesting, or is acquired from
offworld sources with the income earned from exports
of oceanic farming and mining.  Most of its high value
products are petrochemicals, metals, and biorganic
compounds farmed from various underwater species.
Agro is a distant second, and an up and coming
underwater manufacturing industry is in a remote third
place.
<P>
The complexity of the world's oceanic economy demands
a highly skilled workforce, and the local educational
system is renowned for producing engineers,
technicians, undersea equipment operators and other
high demand occupations, required to keep the economy
afloat (ahem!).  The reputation of local technical
institutions attracts offworld students, creating an
additional source of income.  Because of the
specialised nature and intensive training of these
disciplines, a local education is expensive, but
automatically bestows status upon successful graduates
from other nearby minor systems.
<P>
The world was colonised at the same time as
neighboring Ringun, and by the same group of
colonists, and the two worlds have since merged their
governments into a single unitary body, based upon
their strong economic and cultural relations.  The
Combined Government is ostensibly chaired on both
planets, with Ringun handling internal affairs, and
Robalin dealing directly with the Consulate and other
member worlds.  In reality Ringun has been transformed
into the subordinate partner of this arrangement, and
all real power resides with the bureaucratic
government on Robalin and its associated Venues.
Given the reliance of Robalin upon Ringun for dry land
agroproducts, accusations of colonisation are
frequently fielded from outside critics.
<P>
Robalin's local security forces are rather strict on
elements of the population they variously define as
"nonconformist."  Usually these are groups that are
clients or workers of Venues that have fallen out of
favor with the Combined Government, which is a funny
way of saying that they're unemployed thanks to the
usual hobnob and intrigue of upper-class politics.
Harassment, arrest and eventual "resettlement" to
Ringun permits the Comb Gov to not only reduce welfare
payments on the main world, but to deter a recruitment
pool for political opposition and anti-government
violence.
