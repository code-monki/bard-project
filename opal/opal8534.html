Colonial development of Remsen had always been limited
by the Imperial government. In keeping with the
inconsistent policies regarding Chirpers, Remsen's
sizeable local population of these uncasted Droyne was
placed under Imperial protection in the ninth century.
Records indicate that the Ministry of Conservation did
so to prevent public knowledge of their latent psionic
abilities rather than humanitarian concerns. The
Chirpers are all found on the world's largest
continent of Cuvalin, and offworld settlement is
limited to the smaller continent of Dacquirie. The
human population is fragmented into small farming
collectives scattered across Dacquirie, and are
insular and self-absorbed and with little interest in
offworld politics.
<P>
The Collapse disrupted this edenic existence, and
Vargr refugees have moved in to replace displaced
humans. Trade has dried up with the Regency safe, and
the world must carefully preserve what advanced
technology it has left. An unusal form of offworld
assistance has permitted Remsen from collapsing
entirely. The local Chirpers are the first population
to be subjected to the new Droyne Uplift Program.
Droyne kroyloss from Zeen and Ayidem have been on the
world, with Regency funding, since 1171 to carry out
the Iskyar ritual on selected Chirpers of the right
age and character. Most of the kroyloss have bases on
Dacquirie, and by housing and supporting them, the
local communities recieve substantial subsidies from
the DUP and safeside Droyne communities. About two
million chirpers have been casted or evacuated to
safeside, and the Droyne estimate that the entire
population will be relocated by 1215.
