Telypo is a beautiful world found at the far coreward
end of the Avalar Consulate. Despite a thin
atmosphere, the world has a cool and moist climate,
good soils and a number of useful plant and animal
products. A good portion of the world is covered in
large bogs created by recently terminated glacial
activity, and these are rich in organic material that
are attractive for the cultivation of water loving
food crops.
<P>
Unfortunately these same bogs are home to a plethora
of harmful microorganisms, some quite deadly to
humans. The worst of these is a parasite born disease
known as Cold Sickle Fever.  The viral enchephalitic
disease enters the bloodstream by the bite of a local
invertebrate parasite known as the Charon Mite, and
its name from its peculiar pathology. For most people
the only symptom is a simple fever with few other
attendant maladies, but in about seventy percent of
its victims soon suffer a massive "deathblow" as the
virus quickly attacks the central nervous system in
one overwhelming attack. Death can offer occur in a
matter of just a couple of days. Fortunately the
disease is not communicable between humans, and
outbreaks are containable.
<P>
Colonisation of the world was first attempted by the
Zhodani in 309, only to lose most of the colony the
following year to the Cold Sickle Fever. Three more
attempts by the Zhodani failed either because of Cold
Sickle, other diseases, or a combination of all.  The
Zhodani eventually judged the world to be too
hazardous for settlement, and only too happily
transferred the world to the Avalar Consulate with the
rest of their Titan holdings in the late 600s.
<P>
The first two colonisation attempts by the Avalars
were only partially successful, and were confined to
high-elevation areas outside of the infection zones. A
number of research stations attempted to find means of
controlling either the disease or the Charon Mite, but
with only partial success. The Avalar military finally
sent a research team into the "Reaper Zone" and
managed to create several protocols that permitted
their teams to compensate, adapt and tolerate the
presence of the disease. A new bureaucratic government
was established to enforce these containment and
anti-infection protocols, and under their lead the
colonists were finally able to expand into the Reaper
Zone.
<P>
Visitors to the world were always greeted by a heavy
presence of police/health inspectors from the local
Anti-Reaper Service.  Everyone is expected to learn
the local environmental regulations, and visitors are
only admitted to the world if they can pass a written
test concerning those regulations.  Frequent visitors
and traders are granted special travel passes that are
subject to annual recertification. Telypo is unusual
in that the local customs are for EXPORTS rather than
imported goods, as nearly everything from the Reaper
Zone is inspected for Charon Mite infestation (This
isn't paranoia. The mite has shown remarkable
adaptability to other moist environments, and Cold
Sickle outbreaks have occured on neighboring worlds).
<P>
Anti-Reaper Police are a fact of everyday life within
the low lying areas where the mite resides.
Quarantine patrols are identifiable from their white
and red armored vans and cars, and they have extensive
search and seizure powers. These patrols are usually
on the search more for complacency than malice,
usually lapses in environmental regulations.  These
police usually show up in public as polite and proper
uniformed officers, but repeat offenders are subject
to paramilitary SWAT squads not known for their
restraint or patience.
<P>
Local anti-mite regulations require that farmers and
communities drain all bogs and marshes, and clear all
heavy brush, within a 2 km radius. Local clothing is a
combination of light work clothes covered by heavy
cloth tunics, containment netting and smocks
impregnated with insecticide. Domestic pets are
prohibited save for locally domesticated animals not
frequented by the Charon Mite. Livestock are carefully
monitered, and large herds of genetically modified
grazers are used to winnow the local flora to prevent
mite outbreaks. Buildings and communities are
constructed to prevent mite infestation, and materials
and surfaces that can accumulate the moist environment
the mites prefer are prohibited or are carefully
stored.  All of these requirements are enforced with
severe legal penalties.
<P>
Unusually, the Anti-Reaping Service is free of the
usual overactive repressiveness that typifies other
Avalar policing agencies.  Except for a period in the
early 1000s, the the A-RP has never been used for
political repression, and the service has fiercely
disavowed its earlier transgressions.  This is mostly
because the necessity of its protective role cannot be
tied up within political agendas no matter their
source, because of the Service's exemplary commitment
to all levels of Telypo's society, and because the
bases of the local Venues is primarily within the
Anti-Reaper service. Despite its high law level, the
people have long enjoyed a greater range of personal
freedom than most of their bretheren.
<P>
Telypo's main exports are primarily agricultural, and
most of the world's products were shipped to <A href="opal9343.html">Titan</a>
before it lapsed into Civil War. The collapse of its
main market compelled the search for alternatives, and
now most of its goods are marketed to a wide range of
sources from nearby Xenough subsector to a number of
independent worlds in Anika and Mowbrey subsectors.
The world's close proximity to Zhodani territory in
Anika and its habitable climate have attracted a very
large number of Zhodani refugees, many of whom have
settled unknowingly in the Reaper Zone. The government
is trying to transfer these refugees to camps in
higher elevations, in the wake of several large Cold
Sickle outbreaks that have killed thousands of them.
