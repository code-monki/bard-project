Another world in the Spinward Complex. The world is
divided into two halves, with the Navy dominating the
southern hemisphere, and a seperate civilian
government in the north.  Preslin shipyards do special
customisation work, and is the main maintenance
facility that keeps the 2nd Experimental Fleet in
operating order.
<P>
CivGov is a civil service bureaucracy, in many cases
composed of mustered out military personnel. The local
law level is very high, and the worlds factories are
dependent upon naval contracts in order to keep
operating. In truth the naval administration is
preferred by the locals, as its security is less
overbearing and its regulations are more relaxed.
Travellers are advised that CivGov's security services
are in the habit of tailing visiting crews and
tourists, and extralegal detentions are a common
occurence for persons of "suspicious nature."
