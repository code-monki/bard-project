Farplace's name is derived from its location, 4 parsecs into the Great Rift.
Although this distance doesn't seem like a lot to anyone who lived in the
Third Imperium, to the Vilani of the First Imperium it was well named. The
comparatively short reach of jump drives during the First Imperium made
Farplace a two week trip with drop tanks. To complicate matters, astronomers
did not detect any gas giants in the system nor did spectral analysis show
any significant signs of water. Refueling would be a problem. The Vilani, not
known for being risk takers, couldn't justify an expedition to survey the
system.
 <P>
The Vargr overlooked the world as well. The Vargr living in Corridor and
Provence sectors preferred raiding Vilani worlds than exploring new ones.
 <P>
Farplace lay ignored until the First Survey. It was then that the system's
two asteroid belts were discovered. A follow up survey done by Ling Standard
Products determined that the belts were primarily composed of carbonaceous
asteroids but there was a sufficient number of the nickel-iron variety to
justify an investment in the Farplace system. The thinking was to have
belters mine the ore from the asteroids and haul the ore to Farplace for
refining. Transporting the refined ore, as opposed to bulk material, would
save on transportation costs.
 <P>
If Farplace had been a friendlier world, operations would've gone smoother.
Farplace is a desert world tilted 52 degrees on its axis with a day only 13.6
hours long. It has a mean average temperature of 36.2 C (97.2 F). The tilt
drives that average up to 67.4 C (153.3 F) in summer and down to -15.8 C (3.6
F) in winter. These extremes took their toll on the equipment and the people.
Operational costs for the facility were high. Profit margins were small. When
LSP decided to diversify, they decided to sell off their unprofitable mining
operations. Farplace was one of those worlds.
 <P>
Several unions and small overnight companies consisting of belters, refinery
workers, and support staff bought out LSP's claim and divided it each
according to their contributions. When it came time to determine a system of
government, each group became its own fiefdom and insisted it knew the best
way to turn Farplace into a profitable operation for everyone.
 <P>
Forced to share limited facilities, it was obvious that they had to work
together in some fashion. It was decided that each group would be sovereign
over its own claim, but the chief of operations would be voted on based on
who put forth the best 5-year proposal. Of course the voting was lopsided.
The votes of those with the bigger claims, resources, etc. had more weight
than the small guys.
 <P>
Surprisingly, it worked well enough. Every so often, one of the smaller
factions got a turn at running the place. The end result was that the world
achieved TL12 and most people lived relatively well. On a more populous world
things might have been different but, before the Collapse, the population
hovered around 42,000.
 <P>
Farplace didn't choose a side in the Rebellion nor did anyone claim them,
hence the "Na" allegiance rating. Even the Vargr didn't bother to invade
Farplace. Farplace was cut off from what little commercial traffic it
enjoyed. All the inhabitants wanted was a return to normalcy so that they
could boost exports back up to pre-war levels. When the Vilani began to
retake some of Corridor, as part of the Ziru Sirkaa, a small trade route
opened up for exports. Even so, the Vilani did not make a claim on Farplace.
 <P>
Virus didn't totally snub Farplace though. Ships were periodically sent out
to trade refined ore for much-needed supplies. Most didn't come back. The
last ship sent out that returned came back infected with a Samson egg. It
hatched after exiting jumpspace and forced the ship to nose-dive right into
the starport, annihilating it.
 <P>
The remaining ships continued to function for a while. Ice was harvested from
several asteroids and the occasional comet. Eventually spare parts ran out
and the ships broke down. Dirtside, other things began to break down as well
as the harsh desert winds began to take their toll on the equipment. It
wasn't long before the moisture condensers stopped working and the water
supplies ran out.
 <P>
With no more water available for the hydroponics gardens, famine ensued. At
first, there were battles between the various claim holders over the
remaining caches of food, but they soon ran out. A small segment of the
population abandoned the ore refining towns and journeyed to the poles to
escape the summer heat. They hoped to find more favorable conditions for
finding water, whether it be condensed as dew in caverns or lingering
meltwater leftover from the winter. The gamble paid off. Although the years
have not been kind, the population has stabilized around 2200, approximately
5% of the 1117 population.
 <P>
As the seasons are drastic, the people of Farplace have taken up a nomadic
existence. Summers are spent at the poles. Winters are spent near the
equator. With the planet being so small, just over 1000 miles (1600km) in
diameter, and the seasons long (Farplace takes 3.6 standard years to orbit
its sun), these migrations are not hard on the populace. Each pole provides
meager water supplies. Splitting up during the summer increases their chances
for overall survival by ensuring that there will be enough water for all.
 <P>
It is during the winter meetings at the equator that elections take place.
The people vote for those who they feel can best lead them through these lean
years and someday regain what was lost. What's different now is that everyone
gets to vote. All of the old claims are gone. The principal shareholders and
their descendants died clinging to meaningless claims and empty cans.
 <P>
There is also a Winter Festival which is held several local days after both
polar groups have arrived. It lasts for several days. During the festival,
the elected representatives proclaim the accomplishments their polar village
managed during the previous summer. Ideas and survival techniques are
exchanged. The people modestly celebrate surviving another year of Farplace
and look forward to the time when Farplace doesn't live up to its name.
