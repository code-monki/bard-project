The Grudovo Pendant is a j-1 cluster of 13 worlds that
connects Tobia/Trojan Reach with neighboring
Usher/Reft. Originally a cluster of little economic
presence or importance, its economic value has risen
in proportion with the rising volume of trade that
passes between Lintl and Tobia.<P>

Helifil was the recipient of major Aslan immigration,
both during the Civil War, and the early Collapse
period. Most of them are from poorer clans unable to
afford transport to richer and more habitable worlds
deeper within the Regency.  Most of Helifil's original
population lived in a massive subterranean complex of
twisting tunnels and warrens. It is into these manmade
caverns that both the Aslan and remnant human
population has been crammed, and the Amber Zone
reflects the crowding. Research Station Gamma is
located on a small world in the outer zone of the
system, where it continues its antebellum research in
electromagnetic and gravitic research. Like so many
research stations, the work here is mostly classified,
and is offlimits to civilians.
