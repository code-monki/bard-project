Barbary is a bleeding political scab. Its boorish
government has long kept its population in a state of
tranquil ignorance, and under the thumb of its brutal
secret police and security services. Offworld travel
by the populace is heavily restricted, and trade is
confined to agents and brokers whose transactions
favor the ancien regime. The death penalty is invoked
for a number of offenses, and a general culture of
fear and suspicion keeps people in line and eliminates
effective opposition.
<P>
Unlike Lucifer/Gulf, the Regency has been more
reluctant to directly confront the local government.
Unlike that world, the populace here is dispersed
across several smaller communities, each guarded by
their respective nobles and their retinues to troops
and police. Infiltration is therefore unlikely to
succeed. Aside from a few offworld exiles, no
effective opposition party exists anyway, and the
local citizens are too isolated and controlled to
develop any alternatives to their current system.
Unfortunately for the Regency government and its
policy of flexibility, radicals in both Barbary's
regime and various private liberal reform groups have
goaded each other into a confrontation that led to
outbreaks of violence in 1170s and 80s, and the
imposition of an Amber Zone. Merchants are cautioned
against commercial contact with that world.
