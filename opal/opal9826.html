Gazulin is the 10th of 12 moons orbiting Scarpetti,
the systems innermost gas giant. While the world is
coded high population, and is home to a massive number
of industries, the world's primary export is
agricultural produce from its huge overland farms. Two
of Gazulin's sister moons, Ferrara and Prodigy, are
high population worlds in their own right, and also
produce grain and vegetables for export. Major
terraforming projects carried out in the past have
lowered the world's base temperature to one more
amenable to the human populace.
<P>
The world was beseiged by Aslan Ihatei during the
1120s, and a few groups were able to capture
landholds, but for the most part the world
successfully resisted their efforts. Indeed the
emphasis upon its defense forced the majority of Aslan
Ihatei forces to be committed to its reduction,
slowing further incursions into the Marches or Reft.
Out of respect for Duke Sharik Arcadia, whose strategy
it was that prevailed over the Aslan, the Gazulin
ducal seat is maintained for ceremonial reasons, and
popular opinion would rather see it converted into a
constitutional monarchy.
<P>
Gazulin was the object of major immigration during the
1130s. In a ten year period, its population grew from
two billion to forty billion. Consequently this had
strained the world's previous existing infrastructure,
and most of the world's settlements are constructed of
rude, temporary structures that are often overcrowded.
Most of the cities constructed since the Collapse are
towers mounted on the horizontal "flattops" of caisson
buried on the ocean floor; most of these are clustered
together, seperated by estaurine "Canals" into
"Venetian Cities".  Each of these towers is a fully
self-contained island in of itself, and this tends to
encourage fiercely parochial differences between the
populations that dwell within them.  These fueding
factions have forced the original planetary government
to isolate itself on the mainland, and rule through
oftentimes harsh measures. Integration between the
human and Aslan communities varies widely, depending
upon local geography and other variables.
<P>
Gazulin's most striking feature is a huge planet
spanning series of fissures known as the Steakknife
Rift, an artifact of the Ancient Final War. Some kind
of planetary bombardment weapon tore apart the crust,
and large amounts of silicic lava welled into the
gaps. In most places this lava cooled into extensive
obsidian deposits, sharp shards of which are
interspersed throughout the rift and give it its name.
 The world was apparently a major Ancient base, with
several facilities scattered over Scarpetti's more
habitable moons. The only reasonably intact site is
found on the innermost moon of Renaldo; a series of
fully sealed concentric habitats were hollowed out of
the moon, each of them containing a different set of
atmosphere and temperature. What these habitats were
intended to hold has never been determined.
