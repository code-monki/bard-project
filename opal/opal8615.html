The original colony was a group of terraformers sent
to convert the world into one more pleasant to
colonisation, but the project was abandoned after the
Psionic Suppressions, and the terraformers were
abandoned to the tender mercies of their world. The
leftover population had to become self-reliant, and
eventually became quite disdainful of the Imperium.
The isolationist population of Neopidan never depended
upon Midway trade in the past, and the loss of the
Imperium did not adversely affect them. The Collapse
did shock them into action, and the world is strongly
supportive of the military, Quarantine and antiviral
procedures. The population abandoned its older
settlements for an arcology built near the naval bases
planetside facilities.
<P>
The world's main settlement and naval base down
facilities are experimental structures constructed by
a consortium of companies on Vincennes. Built of
advanced TL-16 materials and biotech, these consist of
seperate floating habitats that are constructed of
interlocking concentric circles. In the intervening
gaps, a "bioslime" is secreted by the organic
structures that displace water and provide buoyancy.
In case of a viral attack or severe weather, the slime
can be reduced along some rings to allow the
facilities to submerge until the danger passes.
<P>
Neopidan is the seventh of eleven moons around the gas
giant Origen. The warm waters of the world gives the
population the option to grow food in special floating
greenhouses, which is preferable to the inedible local
sealife, which is primarily primitive algae and sea
fungus. High amounta of carbonaceous material exist in
its mantle, and tectonic agitation will create
infamous "Black Wells", undersea volcanos that spit
this material into the ocean, often poisoning imported
sea life. Toxins from these tides can persist for
years until they settle out or are converted by local
life, and these areas are posted against swimming or
fishing. The world suffers severe weather patterns due
to differential heating of the CO2 heavy atmosphere,
and flight is not recommended in airships or airfoil
aircraft of any kind.
