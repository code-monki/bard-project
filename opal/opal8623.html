Imone is the outermost moon of the gas giant Figaro,
and was only settled in 788 to support naval
refuelling operations in the system. The entire
population lives in orbit as the local atmosphere is
too deadly for surface habitation. Most of the
population works for either the port, the navy and
scout service, or for the subsector government. The
local government is a council comprising the senior
management of local firms and bureaucratic
organisations.<P>

The local shipyard is owned by Morning-STR, and
produces a number of TL-15 designs for the military
and civilian service. The yard and most local
industries are automated with the latest in virus
resistant systems. Unmanned orbital factories churn
out a copous amount of products, a situation made
tolerable to neighboring worlds through stringent
security procedures and numerous failsafes.
