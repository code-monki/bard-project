   <P>
Regency wags like to say that, if the Five Sisters are
the Regency Austrailia, then Iderati is the Regency
Canberra.  Canberra was the capitol of the ancient
Terran nation of Austrailia, and by all surviving
accounts was a place so boring that it was the self-
described "sleep therapy capital of the world."
Native Ideratians dispute this as a matter of pride.
Their world is safe and quiet, and lacks the
hurly-burly and sully industry of Karin or Mirriam.
 <P>
It is true that the world is more park than community,
more resort than industrial center. Iderati was
originally settled in 413 by the Imperial Navy to take
advantage of its habitable climate and rich resources
for fleet resupply and recreation. When District 267
became an official Imperial subsector, the world was
made the capitol, and the 208th Fleet established its
Headquarters here.  Iderati owed, even more than
<A href="opal9508.html">Mirriam</A> or any other Five Sisters world, its existence
to the Navy. Off duty naval personnel used the world
as their main R&R facility. Navy and Marine families
had a marked preferrence for the world over the
Sister's other naval systems.  Naval repair and
support facilities became the world's primary
industry.
 <P>
In accordance with the Navy's wishes, and their own
desire for privacy, the Dukes of Iderati discouraged
settlement by making most of the world a conservancy
under the strict oversight of the Navy and its
supporting bureaucracy. Eventually this bureaucracy
was spun off to become the current world government.
Like many military posts, the locals and their
officials are rather conservative, and many openly
disparage the "gunslinger" economic cultures of worlds
like <A href="9513.html">Wonstar</A> and Mirriam.
 <P>
Environmental laws are rather strict, and economic
development is confined to the just a small number of
urban and commercial areas. Eighty percent of the
world is almost virgin wilderness, that is heavily
patrolled by the world's police, the Outback Rangers.
Despite this oversight, hunting, fishing and camping
are encouraged, and no area of the world is offlimits
to intelligent intrusion, as long as environmental
regulations are followed.  The world's amenities are
very well developed, especially health care and
education, to keep social peace and contentment, and
to prevent social strife from spilling over into the
outback.
