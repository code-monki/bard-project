This world is best described as a frying pan, with the
low atmospheric density and high temperatures causing
the local oceans to boil in the midday sun.
Evaporation and condensation has covered the
continents in thick drifts of sea salts and gypsum. In
the thin atmosphere, wind will pick up and bear salt
particles for thousands of miles, and once in a while
massive storms will cause whiteout conditions,
blanketing the entire world in a billowing
yellow-white cloud. Prominent geological features
include the Frozen Time Canyons, where evaporation and
wind have incised bulbous figures that suggest the
fossilisation of fantastic prehistoric creatures in
the salt walls. Other features include Spider Web
Plains, a vast tableland where ancient bolide strikes
left behind patches of molten rock and salt that
radiate as iridiscent streaks over hundreds of square
miles.
<P>
Yet despite these conditions, and a lack of resources,
the world is an unlikely sucess story. The primarily
Vilani population subsisted upon trade coming down
from the the Deneb Cluster en route to Trojan Reach.
Some asteroid mining was carried out in the local belt
as well, and the government carefully saved the money
for future economic expansion. Cities and underground
highways were cut into the local evaporite beds, and
factories were built on the surface where they could
be powered by windmills designed for the local
environment.
<P>
As nearby Lilad grew in economic power, its attempts
to control the destinies of its neighbors weighed
heavily on Pikha attempts to modernise its economy. In
response to this heavyhanded pressure, local society
took the unusual route of virtually commercialising
everything on the world. Though classified as a civil
bureaucracy, in actuality most of the worlds
government and economic functions are combined into
small network collectives operated on a franchise
basis by interested citizens. This can be a jarring
experience for offworld travellers, as the world is
balkanised by various contractors who operate public
services as well as industries. Most taxation on the
world is in the form of fees and levies on various
commodities and business income, which often includes
a maddening round of hidden surcharges on travellers
who peruse lodging, entertainment and food venues.
These taxes can vary by location, and are levied most
heavily upon industries that are the most expensive in
terms of labor, resources and public nuisance compared
to their long term profitability. Centralised
functions of lawmaking and the military remain in the
government's hands exclusively, as is tax collection
from franchises.  Far from being a free enterprise
heaven, there exists considerable corruption as
franchise holders aggressively lobby the tax
authorities for a favorable hearing.
<P>
The democratisation of kleptocracy would seem to
create a very uncivil society, yet Pikhans are
strictly honest in every other respect due to rigorous
self policing, and for a world of its population,
lacks many coercive bureaucratic rules and overseers.
But a downside to this is the increased
criminalisation of unethical or shameful behavior.
Most lawbreaking is punished by forfeiture of assets,
and public humiliation of the miscreant for a certain
period of time known as the Shunning.  Most often this
takes the form of self-exile, whereupon a person is
confined to a region called Khashii, which is actually
a series of suburbs where the convicted criminal
simply disappears as a person for the length of their
sentence. All ties to their former community, social
circle and family are severed, and they may not
contact anyone outside of a small group of forty or
fifty Shunned for the duration. Capital crimes are
punished with either cold sleep in a Low Berth, or
lifetime sequestration in sealed cells. People who
return from Shunning often have to restart from the
bottom in their particular careers or work.
<P>
Pikha has a long history of cooperation with nearby
Dekha, largely because of strong bloodties between
their original colonists, and their shared antipathy
for Lilad. After Pikha was chosen for the IDP, Dekhan
advisors worked closely with their cousins to buoy up
their tech level. Currently the local level is a high
TL-14 with increasing amounts of TL-15;
recertification of the local TL should come in about
five years. Unlike most recipients of TL advances,
most of these gains have not been redirected towards
military production, and the local population enjoys a
bounty of products rarely seen anywhere else save
Vincennes, Lunion or Mora. Advanced market
segmentation is a hallmark of local products, which
are beginning to include psitech and nanotech adaptive
technology that tailor themselves to their users needs
without much fuss or effort. Pikha is also a leading
manufacturer of "lighttanks", the specialised minature
factories that run on Quantum Teleportation data
packages carried from centralised databases, uncannily
replicating the original product of prototype without
any hassle.
