The Magash binary star system was known to ancient
Solomani astronomers as Albiero. While possessing no
habitable worlds, it has several gas giants, around
one of which orbits an airless rock that contains one
of the most remarkable discoveries in Charted Space.
For nearly 500 miles under the surface is an enormous
layer of hydrated rock, containing more water than
found in all of the oceans on Terra, which is close
enough to the surface to be "mined" by interested
settlers. But this body is actually the result of
tectonic migration from an even more vast body of
water that surrounds the planetary core, the Twilight
Sea. The Sea contains enough water to fill Terra's
oceans five or six times over, but what is even more
remarkable is that it contains and supports life.
<P>
Surveyors discovered this fact in 115, and a Vilani
colony was established here in 133. Because of the
bounty provided by the Twilight Sea and Hydration
Zone, most of the early settlements broke off from
each other and formed their own governments. In every
case settlers built their cities in large impact
craters, building wall-to-wall pressure domes that
provided plenty of room for future expansion. Today
most of these domes have been replaced by huge
structures that resemble giant teardrops burrowing
into the ground, with the sharp end being a large
tower that houses shuttle or starports and most of the
local industry. Drilling into the Hydration Zone
brings water, air and organic material that provides
most local life support needs.
<P>
The world is dominated by the megapolises of Iikilama
and Zimanum, which are linked complexes of several
habitats. Economic competition between these two, and
with other Midway high population worlds in
conjunction with neighboring cities were historically
fierce and marked by guerilla actions and industrial
espionage. Magash's cities are topped by laser and
mass driver turrets originally intended to shoot down
frequent meteors and comets, but eventually became
deterrent weapons during the long cold wars between
these factions.
<P>
Since the Collapse, however, the loss of the Third
Imperium and the threat of Virus has forced the
warring factions into a shaky coalition. This was done
more out of practical considerations like preserving
the world's technological lead in the face of the
TL-15 cap imposed by the First Regent than out of any
love for each other. But since the Collapse the
benefits of linking their economies together has
outweighed conflict, and economic specialisation has
blurred the traditional boundaries between the larger
factions. This grudging acceptance and integration has
been helped by massive immigration by Frontier
refugees, and the fallout of the Ashasi devolution.
<P>
New habitats have been constructed to make room for
the new additions, and in many cases the elites of
various cities have formed joint venture communities
like the famous Rainbow Vale, the Regency's high
powered genetech center that is currently rolling back
the frontiers of genetic engineering and research.
Despite some erosion of technological skills and
abilities, the world is banging on the TL-16 door, and
could easily transform itself overnight. Thanks to the
Rainbow Vale and other genetech centers, Magash is a
major source of biological products for the rest of
the Regency. The world is also a major shipbuilder,
though its higher gravity keeps it from taking full
advantage of its cheap manufacturing and labor. One
transport innovation built since the Collapse are
Tractor/Repulsor driven high speed trains that link
all of the worlds habitats into a single network and
is cheaper than traditional grav and space transit.
All of these developments are supported by Ivy Curtain
schools like the Universities of Iikilama and Zimanum,
which are heavily grounded in sciences and technology.
<P>
The population is strongly mixed, and are friendly to
offworlders. The local communal militaries have been
tentatively unified since 1140 under a special master
appointed by the subsector government. Local troops
often wear outlandish and brightly colored clothing to
identify themselves to local citizens, thereby
forestalling lingering suspicions left over from the
cold war days. In many cases local police have taken
over many of the militaries functions, and take a very
high profile themselves in promoting local civic order
and duty. Some specialised forces are actually media
savvy units staffed by officers with acting abilities
and skills whose exploits are splashed across the
local media nets to underscore civic unity, public
duty and "brotherhood with all sophonts."
