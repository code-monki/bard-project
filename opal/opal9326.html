Caliente means "Hot" in the ancient Solomani Spanish
language.  The world has a very slow 22 day rotation
period, and an axial tilt of 61 degrees. Daytime
temperatures become extremely hot under these
conditions, and bitterly cold at night.  The early
colonists were compelled to seek shelter in
underground settlements, sheltered away from this
severe climate.
<P>
The world's surface water is found in deep rift lakes
and salt marshes located in the northern latitudes. On
average these lakes are six to seven times saltier
than an ocean on a T-Norm world, yet a complex
ecosystem of multicelluar life exists within them.
About half of the planets food resources come from
these lakes, and the locals are especially protective
of their sanctity. Evaporation creates a thick but
brittle salt crust on the water surfaces up to twenty
meters in thickness, thick enough to support
construction and heavy contact vehicle traffic. This
crust is broken up by the prevailing winds, and salt
is often carried around the planet in sufficient
quantities to restrict resperation and gives the world
a taint rating.
<P>
Caliente's surface life has evolved in a very strange
fashion in order to survive.  Most of the native
species are simple invertebrates known as "Zefs", who
reside during the hottest and coldest times of the
"day" buried just underground in shallow burrows.
These remain immobile for very long periods of time,
and draw sustenance directly from the dirt for
photosynthetic organisms that colonise each Zef.  Some
species can grow to the size of terrestrial whales,
but are generally immobile throughout most of the
year, aside from annual migrations between hemispheres
when they burst out of their burrows and congregate in
huge herds, crawling to their destinations.
<P>
Caliente was an unimportant world for most of its
history.  The world is dominated by an oppressive
elite aristocratic class which arose to manage the
vital lakes and their precious food supplies, but
whose power now rests upon their near total monopoly
of the starport and the flow of badly needed trade
both on world and with offworld sources. These nobles
have zealously guarded their dominanace of the world,
and used restrictive laws to eliminate competition or
challenges to their power.
<P>
Economic development along the Corridor has softened
their resistance to outside intrusion, and some
investment has been allowed to upgrage the world's
infrastructure and technology. Few Regency immigrants
have been allowed to permanently settle, and those
that do work on world are temporary residents only.
Large scale development is administered under the
careful eye of the local security services, and
management of large projects is reserved for the local
government. Despite the difficulties created by these
measures, Caliente has enjoyed a three point
improvement, and investment continues to expand.
<P>
Most of this inflow of money has been diverted into
the construction of massive TL-10 Solar Arrays that
cover about five percent of the planets surface. Power
intensive industries such as metal smelting and
fabrication have become the world's main expot
industries, and future plans call for chemical and
waste recycling industires to be constructed over the
next thirty years.
