This world possesses large interior deserts, an
artifact of an ice age that ended about 8000 years
ago. French speaking colonists arriving here in the
late 500s found the local soils depleted by
glaciation, and farming has always been difficult.
After jump drive technology reached Joyeuse after the
Third Frontier War, they contacted Quichotte and found
the local population stricken with severe poverty.
Joyeusean money helped the farmers to finally wring
some decent returns from their fields, and the economy
became willingly dependent upon that aid.  Economic
aid led to the world's willing annexation in 1042.
<P>
In the years before the Islands War, the small farms
were bought out by the Joyeuse government and replaced
with huge "latifundia" governed by wealthy private
landowners. Commercial plantation farming supplanted
subsistence cultivation. The local economy boomed as
larger amounts of food and oil crops, and some
livestock, were exported to Joyeuse.  But most of the
wealth ended up with the landowners, or with the
colonial government, while the locals sank further and
further into impoverished dependence.  During the
Islands War, local production was intensified to the
point of exhausting the land, and pesticide and
industrial residues have poisoned the air and water.
To prevent a rebellion, Soma was passed out to the
populace as a medicinal drug, reducing the population
to penury. To visitors Quichotte is a ghost world,
populated by emaciated and diseased phantoms idling
amidst the ruined farms and castoff dreams of a
feckless imperial master.
