Bilke is a mysterious world on the coreward edge of
the Florian League.  Like Youghal (SM 3039) in the
Marches, the world is on the borderline between a
normal and an ellipsoidal world.  But like the
Ariyhwaao (Beyond 1639) system, Bilke is thought to be
artificial rather than a naturally occuring world. The
world is slightly flattened at the poles, and has an
unusually large bulge at the equator.  Atmospheric
pressure is almost three times that of Terra, and its
gravity is about twice normal.  Its high gravity has
made the world rather uninhabitable to both Solomani
and the Florians that had settled Menorial and
Yggdrasil subsectors. A number of other systems within
the Florian sphere also show similar modifications,
particularly the neighboring system of Vip (TR 0210)
and Zimt (TR 0713), and the age of these changes
coincide with the age of the Ancients, though no
conclusive link has yet been established beyond this
correlation.
<P>
Bilke was first discovered by Solomani colonists in
-974, who surveyed the world, replenished their stores
of water and organics, but otherwise continued on
their way.  The Florian League and IISS surveyed the
world a second time in 611, and the League made a
claim to the system after strange anomalies were
detected.  The current colony on Bilke is devoted
primarily to scientific research, and consists mostly
of Solomani and Regency human scientists and
surveyors.
<P>
Exploration of the world has been hindered by its high
gravity, horrible weather and ferocious wildlife. The
world is geologically unstable, with wild changes in
tectonic and geomagnetic patterns.  The constant
fluctuations create the impetus for speciation, and
the world has unrivalled diversity in plants and
animals. The constant changes in climate have made
many local species either very poisonous or too fierce
for close study, and biological surveys are sill
incomplete.
<P>
The exact modifications that the Ancients made to the
world are still a matter of controversy.
Densitometers record wild fluctuations in mass that
are not commensurate with any natural phenomenon, or
known method of artificial enhancement either. Without
those enhancements the world would be a normal T-Prime
of a rather unremarkable nature.  Scientists have not
even been able to identify where the "wild-mass" is
added to the world, much less how.
<P>
Bilke's entire population lives near the downport in
several sealed communities.  The local gravity is
tiring even after acclimatization, and residences are
equipped with grav compensators for comfort.  The
local economy remains primarily research into the
world and its local environs, but a number of side
occupations have slowly sprung up since the Collapse,
mostly harvesting of minerals and unique organic
products for sale or export to the Regency.  Widescale
colonisation is unlikely due to both the high gravity
of the world, and its relative remoteness from both
Floria and the rest of the Spin Extents.
