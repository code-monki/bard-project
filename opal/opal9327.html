<H3>Overview</h3> Tewupo has long been one of the Avalar
Consulates most important worlds. One of the first
worlds that the Zhodani allowed to be settled, the
world quickly developed major clout as an industrial
producer.  As Avalar and its closest neighbors were
reserved for the Consulates bloated bureaucratic
government, Tewupo became the preeminent industrial
world in the Avalar Corridor by matter of default.
<P>
This came despite the fact that Tewupo's environment
made industrial development difficult. The planet's
dry land is sixty percent bare rock, and its high
oxygen taint discouraged agriculture and the use of
easily corroded metals. But Tewupo's population made
heavy use of unique ecological features known as
"Green Gaps."
<P>
<H3>Ecology</h3> Tewupo has an atmospheric composition that is
27% O2 by volume.  This makes the atmosphere highly
reactive towards cationic materials such as metals,
silicates and unprotected organic materials. The world
is very cool and moist. The local soils are rather
basic, forming hard clays that discourage plant
growth.<P>

This high oxygen taint has existed for billions of
years, the result of hyper-photosynthesis among the
local maritime algal-forms.  When life emerged from
the seas onto dry lands, it took a very unusual path
of evolution in order to adapt. As on ancient Earth,
the first life forms to reach dry land were species
known for their ability to break up the hard rock of
the proto-continents, and permit the aeration  and
nutrient transport required for soil formation.  But
on Tewupo, these pioneers create the basis for all
terrestrial life.
<P>
The base of the pyramid is made up of a plant/animal
hybrid known as Miners. These are semi-mobile colonial
creatures that survive the deadly atmosphere by boring
into the bare rock outcrops, in order to obtain
nutrients that are lacking at the surface. Outcrops,
cliffs, even entire mountains contain the interweaved
"casts" created by a Miner's boring. Miners look like
the Hyphae of Terran Fungi, but are capable of
photosynthesis as well as normal predation and
decomposition.  Some Miners bore down in
acid-resistant soil, some collect precious nutrients
and recycle them to the surface, and some provide a
means of symbiosis or protection for Tewupo's higher
lifeforms; most provide the base of the local food and
biomass chains.
In many regions, Miners are so thick they break up the
ground into gaping chasms or craters, and fill the
void with their interweaving strands, expelling enough
CO2 to make life bearable for other species. These
"Green-Gaps" contain most of the planets species, and
some of them are as large as mountains or large lakes
in surface area. Intricate subterranean networks of
Miners interlink closely connected Gaps, creating
additional channels for the movement of water,
carbonated air, and the local fauna.
<P>
Each Gap is dominated by huge, towering Miners known
as "Green Jollies".  Jollies look like huge green
pillars of whipped cream, or like thick minaret towers
with massive rounded bases (less flattering
descriptions exist). These huge structures are the
form that fills the space as the Gap widens.  Each
Jolly has additional flagella that trail into the
wind, forming a framework for epiphytic plant species
and moss forms.  The organic detritus that falls from
these high forests collect around the base of the
growing Jolly, and decays, giving off CO2 or Methane
that permits a warm and less oxygenated environment
that attracts other life.  Eventually the central
spire will reach maturity (and a height of around
500-1500 meters) and will either branch out through
runners, or will be supplemented by other Jolly
species. Ancient Gaps will have thousands of these
towers, and extensive ecosystems divided by their
elevation.
<P>
<h3>History</h3> Tewupo was settled around the end of the
Second Frontier War by prospectors from Avalar.  The
paucity of metals, and the difficulty of growing
edible plants on the planet, starved out the early
settlers, leaving only a hardy few that learned to
adapt to the planet's harsh environment. Settlers
learned to settle underground near Green-Gaps, and to
follow Miners to vital sources of minerals, to provide
CO2 to reduce the deadly effects of the local
atmosphere, and to provide organic materials and water
for hydroponic farming.
<P>
The settlements became dominated by local landlords
that either owned the Gaps through landclaims, or
controlled the vital transport, life support and
farming industries that kept the colonists alive.
These landlords later became Tewupo's ruling class,
the Thanes. These feudal lords became embroiled in a
series of inconclusive wars over land and commercial
preeminence between 640 and 760, resulting in the
formation of a unified government.
<P>
The world became the focus of most industrial
development within the Avalar Corridor, as the
Consulate government wanted to preserve Avalar and
Milne for administrative purposes. Tewupo dominated
Consulates rimward economy until the Collapse, but has
seen a slide in it fortunes ever since, as the Thanes
have resisted the economic influence of the new middle
classcreated by Regency immigration.
<P>
<h3>Government</h3>Tewupo is ruled by a socialistic
confederacy. Aside from the military and vital
connecting agencies such as the starport authority and
law enforcement, the world is divided up into
seperate, mostly self contained polities centered upon
each Green Gap. Each polity is dominated by a
monopolistic government that regulates all of its
citizens economic and political activities.
<P>
The chief governing body is the Grand Council, which
is composed of the planets ruling Thanes. The world is
divided into several wards, either based around a
single Green Gap community, or several communities
joined into the same network of Miners. Each Ward is
dominated by a single Thane, who is essentially its
absolute dictator. Each Thane is elected by the
Council by a majority vote, and serves as long as they
are judged fit or competent. Most Thanes are selected
from a pool either lesser Councilors, or from military
officers native to Tewupo serving in either the world
or Consulate forces.
<P>
Consensus on economic and poltical issues between
Wards is handled by the GC, helping to stave off
economic stagnation. The council is heavily
factionalised between region and personalities.
Because of the emphasis on economic coordination, the
Coucil serves more as a forum for diplomatic
brinkmanship and economic intrigue than as a unified
government. Only in its dealings with offworld
political bodies does it manage to project unity, and
even then just barely.
<P>
Each Ward is further divided into several smaller
Collectives that are divided by ecology or geography,
each represented by a Councilor nominated by the
Thane, approved by the other councilors on the
Community Council.
<P>
The Wards are regulated solely by the CCs, with little
outside interference from higher authorities. The
citizenry of each Ward is under the exclusive
authority of its government, and may not even move to
another Ward without approval from the adjunct
bureaucracy of the Grand Council, and that is rare
because of the red tape that must be surmounted.
Offworld movement is also regulated, though easier to
accomplish. At any rate each Ward is an insular island
cut off from its neighbors, and significant cultural
divisions have developed over the centuries.
<P>
The supporting bureaucracy includes fully self
contained policing, technical and public services that
handle all day-to-day needs of the Ward and its
citizens. Economic affairs are handled by public
corporations whose charters permit them to interact
with other Wards and offworld corporations within
limits. The economic networks that result from this
contact is often the impetus behind most competition
and conflict within the GC.
<P>
<h3>Society/Culture</h3> The insular nature of most Wards
encourages diversity, and no two are alike in social
outlook. The citizens of each Ward are identified by
hairstyles unique to their community. Hairstyles
include decorations and dye coloring, and range from
simple styles, to intricate patterns the indicate the
individuals position and profession within their
community.
<P>
To further differentiate between their communities,
individual citizenry are encouraged to take up
holidays, hobbies and activities peculiar to them.
Religion and politics are never allowed to mingle with
these customs, for fear of polarization.

<P>

<P>
Tewupo's system is dominated by the the
looming bulk of Gorief, a huge brown dwarf. Gorief's
magnetic fields discourage refueling, or any
settlement on its moons. The sole settlement is a
Consulate naval lab on Depland, that is interdicted
for security reasons.
<P>
Tewupo used to be the center of the Consulates
military-industrial complex, and a large number of
other research facilities dot the system.  Aside from
Depland's labs, these facilities have been
demilitarised and opened up to private enterprise.
These facilities have been unaffected by the
infighting that affects surface industry and remain
profitable and progressive enterprises.
