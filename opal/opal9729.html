Lintl is ruled by the oppressive religion, a cult
espousing the worship of an all pervading pantheistic
continuum known as the Totality. Enlightenment and
salvation proceeds by total submission to the
continuum, and full acceptance of the rules and edicts
of its autarch-priests and their ministers. The world
was, and to some degree still is, an oppressive and
paranoid world. For while the Totality church still
rules this vitally important industrial world, its
power and influence have been waning for years in the
face of the Representational Reforms.
<P>
Most impetus for reform has come from younger members
of the population, who wish to remove the blinders
enforced by the church, and fulfill the vast untapped
potential of their world's massive technological and
academic base. These "Young Lions" are not totally
disrespectful to their old faith, but are seeking to
reform it into a religion that accepts ideas "outside
of the box". In compensation for their seeming
apostasy, these Lions are ambitious for themselves,
their world and their faith to a much greater degree
than the old religious hiearchy had ever been; while
the Totality faith is becoming much more benign in
their hands, the possibility of renewed commercial
dominance by Lintl has mixed reviews in Reft and some
parts of Deneb.
<P>
Since the Collapse, more and more of the population
has been relocated away from cramped subterranean and
underwater arcologies into grav cities and orbital
habitats financed by high demand for the world's TL 15
products.  Most of Lintl's major factories are located
in low or geostationary orbit in what is refered to as
the Outer and Inner Space Rings.  Most of the worlds
food is also produced here, in large sheets of
translucent material called Biocube.  A massive
grouping of Regency military owned shipyards and
munition plants, known as Plant 76, are also located
here, and are posted offlimits to casual passerbys and
civilain ships.  In the past offworlders were confined
to the starport extrality zone; the escape clause
ended that intentional isolationism, and the old zone
has blossomed into a commercial zone known as the Beer
Garden.  A massive number of offworld industries and
companies have facilities here, and the emerging
bureaucratic government is using this contacts to
obtain the tools and materials necessary to rapidly
modernise the world to TL-16, and present a fait
accompli to the Regency government.
