Inkekush is one of the Spinward Complex Reserve
worlds. It is the main support facility for operations
in the complex, maintaining ships and manufacturing
logistics. The world is a fully self contained TL-15
manufacturing center, and is rumored to have been
equipped to survive a possible fall of the Regency to
Virus or Vampire infection. Because of its military
importance, the health of the local environment is a
secondary consideration; heavy air and water pollution
plagues the world, and the heavy brown haze produced
by munition factories that cover the world is visible
from space. To compensate most of the population lives
in self-contained underground arcologies complete with
their own farms and enough life support to run for
years without outside support.
