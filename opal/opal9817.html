The Grudovo Pendant is a j-1 cluster of 13 worlds that
connects Tobia/Trojan Reach with neighboring
Usher/Reft. Originally a cluster of little economic
presence or importance, its economic value has risen
in proportion with the rising volume of trade that
passes between Lintl and Tobia.<P>

The Droyne of Ayidem live in large cliffside
communities that dot an escarpment that scars the
entire surface of the world. This scarp is a remnant
of the Ancients Weapon that nearly shattered the world
during the Final War. The same attack destroyed the
world's small oceans and a blew a good protion of the
atmosphere into space.  The surface temperatures are
too high for the Droyne, and they spend most of the
day underground, opting for a semi-nocturnal
existence. The Ayidem Droyne are famous for their
volunteer military units that serve in the Regency
Army's XIV Corps, a unit heavily involved in
peacekeeping operations along the Thinrim. These
Droyne units are seen as neutral parties by both Aslan
rulers and human resistance groups, and their psionic
abilities make them feared by troublemakers.  Ayidem's
shipyards are jointly owned by the planetary
government and the Regency military; its main products
are naval logistical ships and a few traditional
Droyne designs.
