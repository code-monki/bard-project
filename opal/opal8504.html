 This world is named for its predominant terrain type.
Karst is a barren limestone or dolomitic region
characterised by fissures, sinkholes, caves and
underground channels. The world oceans are rich in
dissolved carbon dioxide, and the local maritime
lifeforms use this as a building material for
protective shells or skeletons. The accumulated layers
of casts and shells of dead marine life are then
uplifted by tectonic action or accretion, and these
limestone barrens form nearly eighty percent of the
world's dry land.
<P>
But because of the world's wet climate and high CO2
levels, rain dissolves weak spots in the karst
regions, creating a world that is swiss cheesed by
massive cave systems nearly unrivaled in the former
Imperium. Solid ground is nearly nonexistent, as there
are few areas where the ground has not been undermined
by underground rivers or subject to the formation of
sinkholes. To further complicate matters, the local
water table is extremely high in most areas,
preventing underground tunneling.
<P>
Because of the scarcity of land, and the infertility
of karst without long term development of topsoil, the
world's government is primarily concerned with
alleviating scarcity of living space, and providing
enough food and energy for habitation. The high law
level reflects its draconian habitation laws, which in
theory limits offworld immigration and population
relocation. Weapons are also illegal on Karst, and
traffic in such devices is a capitol offense. Most of
the government is little more than overglorified
municpal officials, as the world has very little
infrastructure beyond some limited road and rail, and
large tracts of wilderness effectively limit transport
to air and water.
<P>
Most of the world's cities are built in either the
drier cavern systems, offshore in shallow coastal
waters, or most dramatically float in the larger
sinkholes. The latter includes the capitol city of
Bronko, which floats in a sinkhole nearly 5 kilometers
in diameter.  The world's downport is constructed on a
granitic island about thirty kilometers from the
capitol, and is connected to it by a long series of
natural and manmade underwater and underground vehicle
and rail tunnels.
<P>
Since the Collapse, the world's population has swelled
considerably. It is no secret that Karst is a
"firebreak" world, the next line of defense in case of
a massive Virus or Vampire penetration of the
Frontier. Its geology makes the world a natural
fortress, one that Virus would have great difficulty
in overcoming.  The perception of this security
coupled with the availability of unclaimed "land" in
its wilderness attracted a massive number of refugees
from Antra and Millions subsectors. But unlike many
worlds which enjoyed an increase due to the
Abandonment, local services have not been strained
qute as much as expected.
<P>
This is largely due to a strong tradition of
resistance to the government. The oppressive land
regulations has long compelled Karstians to simply
take off on their own into the outback. Because water
is an abundant commodity, many "refusegees" will
simply hook up a fuel or solar cell unit to the
surface, and run power cables into a cavern or ravine,
where a hydropod grows food or medicinal crops.  Much
of the world's cave networks have never been mapped or
officially explored, and it is difficult not to
stumble over somebodies sight unseen "homestead" in
the wilderness. The government abhored the existence
of these unregulated communities, but is reluctant to
take strong action as their forces are at a strong
disadvantage in these poorly explored caves and
badlands. In the aftermath of the Collapse, millions
of refugees did likewise, building wildcat settlements
in direct abeyance of local laws. In the end the
government simply accepted this fait accompli, and
extended its security cordon around them with military
and financial assistance from the Regency.
<P>
But in some cases the government has used these cave
networks for its own advantage. Located under three
hundred feet of water offshore of the main continent,
a massive salt dome was partially hollowed during the
700s. When the company running the mine went bankrupt
coincident with the advent of the Psionic
Suppressions, the planetary government took over the
mine, known as the Countinghouse, and converted into a
deep storage facility. Use of this facility is not
limited, and it has both private and public, and rich
and poor clients that dump their belongings here for a
small nominal fee. Everything from cuckoo clocks to
Imperial/Regency documents can be found here, and its
rumored that gold bullion and the other wealth of
people and institutions fleeing the situation in
Corridor during both the Vargr invasions and the
Collapse rests undisturbed and unclaimed, as many
owners did not survive to reclaim it. Security at the
Countinghouse is very tight, and access is limited to
a large natural cavern system that runs from a private
Class C starport facility on the surface. The exact
size of the Countinghouse is classified, and it is
managed by a public corporation fully answerable to
the government and its clients.
<P>
Rumors also exist of smaller facilities built across
the world to cache arms and supplies in case of a
Viral breakthrough.  No evidence of these caches
exists, though it is true that the Regency Navy and
Marines have an unusual interest in the world, as
evidenced by the heavy Naval traffic into the system.
<P>
Karst's small shipyard is owned by Specter Ironworks,
a mid sized company based primarily in Trojan Reach
and Reft. Ironworks products are geared towards the
low end, taking advantage of the Starship Shortage in
a shrewd manner.  The local yard primarily builds a
number of TL 10-12 budget freighters, using parts
manufactured locally or on nearby Petrarch (1712),
largely for the local j-1 or 2 traffic in the Karst
Cluster or coming up from the Frontier into Inar.
