The former colony of Waaliki (Deneb 0706). When the
motherworld fell into the Frontier, the planetary
government percieved their world as being too
vulnerable to Viral or Vargr attack, and it was
decided to abandon the world for the more habitable
colony. Kamisaraki was previously a marginal
agricultural world that provided produce and food for
Waaliki, and the shift was not entirely welcomed by
the population of either world, largely because of the
disruption it entailed. The government wisely invested
in local infrastructure, and has managed to create a
viable alternative source of income. In spite of the
hot climate, it has developed a significant tourist
industry, sustained by visitors from Urnas that
patronize the worlds burgeoning resorts and casinos.
Agriculture remains the main export, but most of the
population works in various service industries,
catering to offworld visitors.
