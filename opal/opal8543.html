Erita has always been a backwater, so to speak. The
world has been sustained by undersea mining operations
of various kinds, and harvesting of a massive swimmer
known as the Gharder Serpent, whose meat and blubber
offer up various substances useful in chemical and
pharmaceutical applications. The population is
scattered in small villages that line the coastlines
of whatever solid ground exists, though for most of
the year these are abandoned while crews work the
mining and fishing platforms.
<P>
The most common form of habitation are small
houseboats, usually made of lightweight materials and
propelled by sails or cheap fuel cells. Aside from a
few permanent structures, most "buildings" in a local
village are wharfs of these floating homes, which are
unmoored during the main harvest and mining seasons
(late spring to early fall) and wander the world-ocean
in search of goods for sale and trade. In antebellum
times the world had a more substantial permanent
population, but most of these were evacuated during
the Abandonment.
