Third Mu is the third moon of the innermost gas giant
in its system. The world is tidally locked, as it
orbits the gas giant of Mutaran every seventeen days.
The freeze and thaw cycle of most such worlds is
avoided thanks to its world ocean, which moderates the
temperature enough to prevent boiling on the light
side, and freezing on the dark side. The cycle of day
and night has encouraged the development of an
unusally rich ecosystem, creating some of the
greatest undersea diversity ever discovered in the
former Imperium.
<P>
This rich world was an Imperial Reserve World for most
of its history. Until 988 it was interdicted by the
sector government to protect its rich seafloor and
asteroid ore deposits, and its local wildlife. After
the world was opened to outside exploitation,
infighting between rival mining corps and the
disruptions of the Frontier Wars prevent much
development. Concerns over the unhindered strip mining
of the system further delayed projects, and only since
the Collapse period have plans been finalised to
develop the system.<P>

But the impetus for this development have been the
increasing social and political violence on nearby
Lilad. Segments of the population, particularly large
planetary corps and industrial combines, have been
looking for a safe haven in the event of the feared
ekpyrosis (burning) that would tear their homeworld
apart. Because of its proximity, and its wealth, a
growing number of these firms have invested money into
the SpinDev/Venturprise operations on Third Mu. Most
of this development is concentrated near the downport
in the Bulgur Archipelago, and includes a growing
community of commercial and residential structures for
about 10,000 people. Given the strains evident on
Lilad in recent years, inhabitation is likely to come
very soon.
