Dolberg was originally settled by Imperial colonists
in 859. Despite its deadly atmosphere, the world had
very rich sources of platinum group metals, deposited
on the shorelines of the world's acidic oceans. A
number of Imperial companies built facilities on the
world to harvest these resources, and export them back
to the Imperium. Labor struggles led to the imposition
of a cynical bureaucratic government at the behest of
these offworld commercial interests, often citing a
repressive code of environmental laws known as the
Codex to enforce its decrees. The government and its
backers were strongly Pro-Imperial, but mostly as a
marketing ploy to maintain the Imperium's goodwill,
and preserve the world's independence.
<P>
Dolberg was invaded by a very strong force of Aslan
Ihatei in late 1118, and the government surrendered
without a fight, even though the populace wanted to
resist. Aslan rule was rather benign, though
unpopular. The world was liberated by Regency forces
in early 1132, and was incorporated into its borders
as a final adjustment. The planetary governments' poor
performance against the Aslan led to widespread
unrest, and it was overthrown in a bloodless coup in
1135. Longstanding anger over the excessively onerous
Codex led to a rejection of any kind of centralised
authority, and a moderate feudal technocratic network
has become the main government. The lack of a unifying
legal code has been compensated for in part by the
creation of a communal security force, and a "karma"
system of protocols and predefined accepted behavior
practiced by major community groups and local
businesses.
