  <P>
In antebellum days, Emape was a lawless border
community populated with smugglers and pirates.
Violations of Imperial customs were frequent, and an
Amber Zone was imposed to protect visitors and
crackdown on this illicit activity. Most of this
activity was loose and disorganised, dominated by a
group of insular extended families who called
themselves the "Cool Gang." Most of their contraband
was illegally exported Imperial technology that was
resold to neighboring states for a high margin of
profit.  And some of it was espionage driven, though
the Cool Gang was relatively patriotic and avoided
buyers that were obviously Zhodani.
 <P>
The creation of the Quarantine gave the Regency a
pretext for cleaning the planet up.  The RQS evicted
smugglers and convicted Quarantine violaters back
safeside, often confiscating their ships and revoking
their licenses. Naval police actively patrolled the
worlds cities, and a dusk-to-dawn curfew enforced.  To
further cement control of the world, the Ministry of
the Interior began encouraging new settlement in 1135.
The Cool Gang was broken up, imprisoned, evicted and
mostly driven out of business.  Smugglers attempting
to emulate the Gang or take over their rackets have so
far been unsuccessful, thanks to the massive RQS
presence still stationed on the world, and the massive
number of fatalities incurred trying to run the
systems vast arrays of automated weapons and fields of
captor mines.
 <P>
The world is still a volatile place to visit, as many
of the original locals have "defended" themselves
against the new immigrants, or have been driven into
the outback. The Amber Zone now reflects this tension,
and the extraordinary security measures taken to
ensure that the world's troublesome past doesn't
repeat itself. Fortunately, aside from a few
outbackers and paroled Cool Gang members, most of
Emapes original population quickly adapted to the new
situation on the world, and instituted a popular
democracy to fill the vacuum created by the Gang's
downfall.  Law levels are still rather low, and a
holstered sidearm seems to be part of the local dress
code.
 <P>
About ninety percent of the population are new
immigrants from safeside, or their second and third
generation descendants. The old settlements have
undergone significant expansion, and new developments
ring the starport. Most of the population is sustained
by employment in the port, its business districts, or
the massive hospitality businesses that have sprouted
to serve ship crews and their support personnel, as
well as the navy and the RQS.  Casinos, bars and
brothels are in strong evidence, and most vice is at
least semi-legal, or at least winked at by the local
and Regency authorities. MoJ and Regency Intel
maintains several watch stations to look out for known
fugitives and criminals attempting to sneak through
the border, or just attracted by the world's
playround.
 <P>
It is no suprise that the world is home to speculators
and scalawags no better in some instances than the old
Gang. The world is on the front porch of both the
Regency and the Hinters, a prime location for shady
operations that "keep a toe" on both side of the
border, ready to disappear to one side or the other to
avoid scrutiny or investigation by authorities.  RQS
and MoJ keeps a close if discrete eye on these
operators, and it is rumored that they have an
extensive network of informers to keep them appraised,
more than a few of them swimming among the same fish
the authorities try to hook and land.
 <P>
Emape's port is one of three main passages to and from
the Coil and the Regency mainstream. While not a
massive port by the Rand's overblown standards, it is
the largest port ever constructed for a mere
population 6 world in the entire Regency. While most
border crossers will travel to Mirriam and Karin to
offload their safeside bound cargoes, or to Marrekesh
or Avalar if going the other direction, many
independent merchants do not proceed beyond this
point, and the port becomes a holdover and transfer
station for many small cargoes. In many cases such
transfers are attempts at sleight of hand, trying to
sneak contraband across the frontier. The more things
change, the more they stay faithful to their origins,
one supposes.
