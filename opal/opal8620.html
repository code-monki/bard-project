Rena is a research station operated in conjunction
with the local scout base. The facility mostly
researched and designed new equipment for the Scouts,
usually in conjunction with the Exploratory Office in
its jaunts into the uncharted space to coreward and
spinward of the Domain of Deneb. Since the Collapse,
it has refocused on untapped resources within the
Regency itself. The world's scientists now work under
contract to various communal and planetary governments
in areas of ecological sciences, botany and geology.
<P>
Rena itself is interesting to scientists, but to few
other people. Local H2S levels are high enough to kill
unprotected sophonts in a matter of seconds, and have
discouraged offworld development and colonisation. The
world's seismicity is rather predictable, and
scientists journey to Rena to test earthquake
detection and prediction apparatus.
