        Like Berkin, Welch was subjected to nuclear bombardament during
the Collapse, losing over 99% of its population to the bombs, radiation 
poisoning, disease and starvation during the subsequent nuclear winter.
In the aftermath, the world followed the usual post-Collapse pattern,
fragmenting into a seething nest of competing TEDs, most no more than
bandits or local gangs.<p>

        In 1187 Welch was finally reunified under one ruler, however
after a brief reign of four years he was assassinated, and one of his
lieutenants, the self-styled Lord Gaskin, assumed control. He has 
maintained a firm grip on power ever since, and shows no sign of losing
it anytime soon.<p>

<b>Adventure ideas</b><br>
        Face it, this place is a dead loss. Gaskin isn't interested in
allowing RCES bootstrap teams in to improve his people's standard of 
living, he isn't interested in negotiating long-term trade and technical
assistance treaties, and he certainly isn't interested in stepping down
in favour of a more representative form of government which will guide
his people towards reintegrating into interstellar society. What little
off-world trade he does allow is typicly for weapons, or luxury goods for
him and his cronies - and few traders are willing to risk having their
ship siezed or pay the rather steep tarrifs he imposes. <p>
    
    One long-term adventure here is to infiltrate onto Welch with
the aim of setting up a pro-RC resistance movement which can then step
into power when the RC topples Gaskin and his "army".<p>
