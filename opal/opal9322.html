Tapsa-64 was only settled by the Avalar Consulate in
the aftermath of the Third Frontier War. The Consulate
had originally passed over the world because of its
lack of resources, and remote location. Only the
Avalar military made regular trips to the system, to
either prevent illegal settlement, or for naval
maneuvers.

<P>
But during the war the success of Imperial commerce
raiders and privateers, and the postwar increase in
piracy that resulted, pointed out a window of
vulnerability within the Avalar frontier. It was
feared that in a future war, the Imperium would use
bases along the lower Beyond-Foreven interface to
attack Zhodani shipping into the Trojan Reach, and
weaken the Avalars. Tapsa-64 was settled with mostly
military personnel, and a naval base was built to
protect the approaches to the Avalar Corridor,
particularly nearby Estyske and Belisha (Beyond 1701).

<P>

The base served its function well in the next two
frontier wars, forcing  the Imperials to avoid deep
penetration raids into Foreven or Beyond. The base
also served another important purpose, it supported
Zhodani task forces operating in Trojan Reach. In fact
the unit involved in the Ganulph Maneuver originated
from Tapsa-64. The world developed a heavy Zhodani
presence as a result of this cooperation, and the base
also saw Tozjabr and Consulate Guard commando units
stationed as part of its normal garrison.

<P>
But much more interesting was the worlds slow
transformation into a military training and testing
center. The Zhodani poured billions into constructing
facilities to produce needed munitions and supplies
away from their main supply bases. A number of
training facilities were constructed as well,
including a number of psionic test facilities.  Test
and operation ranges were constructed for both joint
maneuvers, and to keep Zhodani Deeprim patrols in
fighting trim.

<P>
The post-Collapse period ended the rationale for the
base.  It also ended the centuries old alliance
between the Zhodani and the Avalars.  By 1150 the base
had been abandoned by the Zhodani, and the facilities
were shuttered and placed into mothballs.  Currently
only a handful of old factories are still in
operation, producing spare parts for the Avalar's
dwindling inventory of Zhodani military designs and
equipment. Large parts of the world are still
off-limits to civilian personnel, and rumors abound
about the actual extent and function of its
facilities.

<P>
Despite the continuing closure of the world, visitors
are given a warm welcome at the starport.  Apparently
the Consulate government is trying to sell or convert
a number of now unnecessary facilities for civilian
use, and the downport is the main sales and
advertising office for this conversion effort.
Travellers will encounter special tour groups, sales
offices, or shops full of goods produced as samples of
military conversion.
