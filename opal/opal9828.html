Neumann is the most progressive of Trojan Reach's
industrial worlds. For centuries it was a major base
of the General Development Company, and a major
recipient of its ministrations. Even in Antebellum
times high expectations existed about the world's
prospects as an industrial power in the Thinrim. In
the aftermath of recieving IDP subsidies, the world is
now "banging" on the TL-15 cap, and could advance to
TL-16 in less than a decade. Anti-Aslan prejudice is
rare, and trade with the Hierate is vigorous and free.
<P>
Most of Neumann's industries are engineering and R&D
oriented, and major Regency and Aslan corps maintain a
number of labs and design studios. Neumann has also
become a major producer of "Post-Virus" robotics and
automation, as robotic science was preserved locally
in spite of wide hysteria in the wake of the Rape of
Trin. Neumann is also a major source of naval and RQS
vessels, which are primarily produced in the orbiting
Plant 93 high over head.  Neumann's shipyards are
owned by Grand Design of Glisten, and the company
bases half of its R&D personnel here.
<P>
Because of the local economy's heavy technical
orientation, a number of major educational
institutions support local industry. These include the
privately run Suo Polytechnic University, and the
government run Neumann National University, both of
which have a heavy concentration in sciences and
engineering. Suo Poly is entirely based in its own
space habitat; SP has its own production facilities,
allowing hands on training in a number of industrial
applications and vacuum operations.
<P>
The rest of the Neumann system is heavily populated as
well. Neumann's large moon, Ringler, has a population
of twelve million, and is the site of the main naval
base insytem. The Regency Navy and local military also
maintain a number of joint training facilities in
Neumann's innermost asteroid belt, which is also home
to a population of four million people, primarily
working for mining companies. Neumann's nearest
neighboring world, Wittkop, possesses a thin
atmosphere and is covered in large glaciers; the world
is inhabited by several scientific collectives and a
pair of reclusive religious groups.
