Ash's primary is an ancient star. The world is at least ten
billion years old, and most of its original atmosphere
has leaked away. It is swept by powerful windstorms
that strip away rock, dirt and ice, carving the local
landscape into grotesque forms. The local climate is
bitterly cold, and difficult to breathe without a
mask. And yet the world had attracted a sizeable
population of humans in antebellum times. The world
possesses massive deposits of iron and copper, and
large processing plants, smelters and foundries were
constructed to convert the local ore into a useful
form and make implements for export. Other industries
were established in their wake, and Ash had a sizeable
antebellum population despite severe local conditions.
It still possesses the largest population of any
Frontier world in Pretoria Subsector, a fact viewed as
a liability by many in the Regency Safe. Wreckage from
the Battle of Ashes is maintained in orbit as a
gravesite and zero-gravity museum by the planetary
government.
