El D'nah's local ecosphere includes a parasite that is
attracted to the nasal passages and sinus cavities of
both Humans and Vargr. The infection they create is
rarely fatal, but it is extremely painful and can
create permanent blindness and brain damage by
exerting pressure on the brain and eyes. Most of the
population lives in heavily filtered houses that are
regularly swept with ultraviolet lights that kill the
parasites. The local communities are lit with
blacklight flourescent lights, giving them a ghostly
appearance. The local economy is dominated by iridium
mining, and nearly the entire population is employed
by the mines or work in support of them.
