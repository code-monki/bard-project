  Nex was an extremely rambunctious participatory democracy before the final war,
And with the Collapse succumbed to mob violence and extreme technophobia.
Local military leaders, however, seized control of the administration of the
government and protected a significant part  of the world's technological base
from the panicked  population, all but ending both looting and vandalism. While
technically a TED , the planets ruler  imposed order and ended the worst of the violence.
<P>
    Although the successor to the original TED was more in the familiar mold of a
petty tyrant, the planet's third (and current ) ruler since the Collapse , General  Haim
Laszczansk, has returned to the original philosophy of the first Military Governor.
Laszczansk has developed trade and diplomatic relations with Oriflamme and is currenTLy
negotiating  for entry into the Coalition . The planets current government values are :
<P>
<UL>
     Corruption: Low<BR>
     Talent: High<BR>
     Cruelty: Moderate<BR>
     Aggression: Low<BR>
     Paranoia/Xenophobia: Low
</UL>
<P>
 Oriflamme  sponsors this membership  and has pushed for allowing the government type to be considered a feudal technocracy, given adoption  of a formal constitution acceptable to the Coalition Assembly . Aubaine , however has opposed this, fearing
that this is simply a ploy on Oriflamme's part to add further F-tech votes to the assembly at  any price . Aubaine has instead proposed a global referendum and constitutional
congress to develop a, ore pluralistic form of government, a position unacceptable to
both  Oriflamme and Laszczansk , as Laszczansk  righTLy fears that a referendum would merely affirm  the xenophobic and technophobic  tendencies of his population, and
overturn  the "middle ground" that he is enforcing.
<P>
                                                                      From <cite>Path of Tears</cite>  p141
  </UL>


     Nex has finally gained entry into the Coalition . This was made possible by three
key events. First General Laszczansk invited the Aubani government to send a fact
finding mission to his world, which it did, in order for them to understand why their
demands were so problematic. Afterward the general himself travelled back to the Coalition to plead his case in front of both the Aubani government and the Coalition
Assembly culminating in an en-passionate  speech  before all 192 representatives.
Most found the general's  arguments well thought out and  his concerns for the future well being of his people  to be genuine and sincere.
<P>
  The third event and possible the most important of the three was the bargain struck
by both the Centrist and Federalist block to grant simultaneous membership to both Nex and Teldora.
      In this deal the general had to make a few compromises on his own. While wide scale democratic reform are unacceptable he did agree to implement some on a smaller scale. Up to now all setTLement on Nex  have been run by a military administrator the
rank and power of which depended on the size of the settlement. The municipal  structure will be modified with the addition of  locally  elected town consuls. The military administrator will still be present but will have a vote equal to that of any other individual consul member.
<P>
    In order to raise local living standard a bootstrap  operation is under study. The general is all to well aware of  his population's technophobia and  so has this operation to take a more leisurely pace. The plan call for a boost to TL-8 over a 10 to 15 year period. Its is felt that TL-8 is close enough to the current level (6) as to not traumatize  Nexian society
overly yet  is high enough to both bring tangible living condition improvements and to
give them a taste for more later on. The extended  time (10 to 15 years subject to adjustment  as the project goes along) will give them both time to accept the change and
their new-found Coalition citizenship.
 <P>
   Even before membership was granted the general took the initiative to renovate the old
starport enough to  classify it as D. The port in question was previously a secondary class B facility as Nex old class A fell victim to a Black War strike force when Lucan's navy  retreated  before the advancing Solomani forces.  In turn the Solomani navy turn it into a forward  base.  Still buried in underground  landing bays are three powerful Solomani built
<a href="../sara/sara0007.html"><I>Ramrod</I>  Missile Boats</A>, the previous rulers left them undisturbed due to fear of a viral infection. The bays hold other assets that have yet  to be uncovered.
<P>
     For now the world must rely  for Vampire defense  on a few surviving TL-12
PAD silos, a large number of TL-6 AD batteries and a smaller number of TL-9 ones imported from Oriflamme. The Nexian military has also imported a few orbital
passive arrays and a single missile platform placed in geostationary  orbit above the new port.
<P>
    The world sees light commercial traffic thanks to the new fueling station at L`steich
specifically built by Oriflamme  to provide a viable jump-2 route to Nex. Baldur has built
a similar station at Sarid to extend this route to their new colony at Poyzen  via So Skire and  Ehart. Because of the developing situation with the Solee Empire in neighboring
Shenk the Coalition Navy taking a cue from the Solomani has built (in a rather rushed manner ) a small scout base  to act as a forward staging area.  A pair of <I>Dragon</I> SDBs was brought in to guard the facility.
