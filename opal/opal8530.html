Lamas is a young world of less than a billion years
age. Life has not progressed beyond primitive
unicellular anaerobes that dwell around volcanic
hotspots on the world-ocean floor. Volcanism has
deposited large amounts of useful industrial metals on
the ocean floor, and this attracted colonists in the
760s. Oxygen can be more easily obtained from
seawater, and most of the population lives in
submerged cities built on tectonically stable ground.
The downport is a collection of raised platforms and
floating docks built in a shallow part of the
equatorial region. Most of the population is engaged
in various mining and industrial jobs; most locals see
the subsector government as a distraction, and wish
that it were relocated to another world entirely. The
Lamas naval base has a tech level 16 shipyard, known
as Plant 97, that constructs small warships and
gunboats for the Navy and RQS. These include the
 <I>Barekdoldin</I> Patrol Cruiser and a number of other
designs supposedly built only by the Darrians.
