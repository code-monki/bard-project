Spokes was a close call colony.  One of the last
worlds colonised by the Avalar Consulate, it was the
victim of political indifference, bureaucratic and
local infighting, and bungling at all levels.
<P>
The world was settled by reason of politics.  Nearly
all of the surveys of the world found little or no
compelling reason for its settlement, as it possessed
few resources worthy of exploitation. The local
asteroid belt had attracted a small community of
belters, but aside from the starport and the huge
amount of trade traffic coming from neighboring Titan,
the system was virtually ignored.
<P>
But in the late 800s, a political controversy ignited
between the Venues of Titan and Hepring over property
and land rights within their shared cluster of worlds.
A series of minor land invasions and sporadic trade
wars went on for about thirty years, culminating in a
colonisation attempt of Spokes by Titan.  About five
million colonists were planted on the barren world in
901 to stave off a takeover by Hepring. When the
controversy between them petered out under increasing
Consulate scrutiny, Titan failed to evacuate the
colonists from their useless outpost, and instead kept
up mandatory immigration, prompting a few critics to
wonder if the mother world was more worried about
dumping its undesirables than in legitimate landgrab.
<P>
The world was placed under a partial interdiction,
with trade and contact limited to the starport
environs, and then only under heavy guard.
Interloping ships were prevented from approaching the
main cities by their underground construction, and by
patrols from the Titan Planetary Navy.  People under
sentence were placed under heavy surveillance, and
were required to contact, at regular scheduled
intervals, a "caseworker" within the colonial
administration that kept track of their whereabouts.
People whose sentences expired were rarely permitted
to return to Titan, and were still confined to the
world, except that they didn't have to put with as
much intrusion, nor report to a caseworker. The world
was nothing more than a glorified gulag, and that most
of the Consulate's governing authorities tolerated it
reflects badly upon its internal politics.
<P>
The colony recieved little support from the homeworld
other than the bare minimum, which seemed to support
the idea that the world was an exile camp.  Dissidents
of Titan's increasingly authoritarian government that
failed to tone down their strident criticism found
themselves serving life sentences on the world with
their families and sometime their immediate circle of
relations.  These were later supplemented, and
replaced with wholesale shipments of undesirables,
criminals, indigents and the homeless.  Penal labor
was prohibited by the Consulate government, so these
prisoners were denied what would have a useful
diversion from the poverty of their new homes, which
was perhaps the point.
<P>
But the nature of most of Spokes' immigrants
eventually helped more than it hindered.  While the
practice of life sentencing eventually created a
permanent population of exile descendants that had no
place or home on Titan itself or any other world for
that matter, the education level of their parents and
subsequent waves made them more resourceful than would
be expected.  A strange service economy eventually
emerged, with the locals exchanging whatever goods and
services they could manage, in return for currency
that was carefully saved and invested.  While those
under sentence were prohibited to keep money beyond
their own upkeep, labor arrangements and sponsoring
saved excess profit from their labors as well.
<P>
As this modest nest egg expanded, a number of artisan
industries were fostered.  First seen as a joke by
Titan and other neighboring worlds, a sort of "56th
century Ren Faire", these handicraft industries found
markets for their wares.  Traditional metalworking,
textiles, foodmaking, glassblowing and carving
industries were constructed, and eventually they
married with high-tech processes for high quality and
safety.  Spokes is most famous for its intricate
glass, crystal and porcelain work.  Where in the
ancient past Waterbury and Meissen were once names of
quality, Spokes has become the modern trademark of
elegance.  So reputable have its wares become that the
poky prison world has trade contacts as far as Aslan
worlds bordering on the Rift.
<P>
The Post-Collapse controversies on Titan have little
affected the world's status quo.  The colonial
government stopped recieving exile transports, and has
been little more than an efficient yet unimaginative
group of flunkies that generally stays out of the
locals attempts at making money.  The world still
remains a stifling and somewhat paranoid place to
visit, as the old security regulations have only been
relaxed in minor ways.
