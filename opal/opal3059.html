<h3>Planets of Note</h3>
<B>Esther:</B> Esther was an independent mining expedition during the founding of
the system, sent from Rebields.  The main effort was LSP, LIC, out of Syrs
(0520) which landed its folks on Sarcathon.  The Habitat suffered a stray
hit during the war, and the miners had to be lifted off by LSP�s insystem
freighters. Before this, it was the premier diamond & corundum gemstones
mine of the system.
<P>
<B>Beanfields:</B> Originally settled during the 2nd Imperium�s hey day of
colonization by  Pre-contragrav  Colony ships, as they believed the high
gravity world  Sarcathon would leave them marooned until they could build
their own. The severely regressed during the Long Night, back to pre
industrial levels until recontacted by the Mining operation out of Syrs.
LSP�s security forces conquered them easily, and they were subjugated to as
an agrarian based economy to keep the Mining world fed. Relations bettered
over the years, especially since Sarcathon was poor in soil suited for  all
but the barest subsistence agriculture, and lack of native water resources
meant expensive irrigation. Costs LSP cut by shipping the foodstuffs from an
orbit away.  Due to the Hard Times restructuring, Virus had little impact
upon the world, and has maintained its TL-8. Contact with the Main world was
maintained through Radio and physically with Far Rebel-Class STL lighters,
purchased by LSP to keep up with the Megacorporations 1124 restructuring
Plan.
<P>
<B>Romulus:</B> A Dry World, LSP kept it�s premier Ore smelter system operating
here, even though the world�s tech was TL-9 overall.  Company offices and
records were kept on Remus, which was lost in the Collapse.  Today the
hi-tech system is kaput, although the  General Products, LIC 10dtn Cargo pod
maglev projector is still operational. The Only portion of the plant still
operational is the Uranium enrichment processing plant.
<P>
<B>Ripper:</B> The last planet occupied in the system�s history, Ripper was done as
an independent company of former military & In-system pilots Guild. Due to
the instability of the rings and gas giant storms around its parent, called
"Shipkiller" for good reason�Starship insurance rates for the LSP bulk ore
freighters  coming here were 24% higher than other Mining systems in the
subsector.  Ripper was founded as  part Search and Rescue and part Salvage
of those visiting  the Sarcathon system, or who jumped in outsystem (typical
Imperial Navy tactic).  They operated a number of Fast  spacecraft, jump
shuttles, and powerful tugs out of here, and more than once rescued  a
damaged Navy or Commercial ship that blundered in. This was especially true
during the 2nd  Solomani-Imperial War., where the men of the "Ripper Special
Boat Service" distinguished themselves, rescuing both Imperial and
Confederate crews.  During the Collapse, these same brave men and women went
forth and rescued marooned folks in doomed infected ships. Many perished,
but many more were saved.  The dead hulls of Final war kills, and  Virus
slain ships are all marked by transmitter beacons here.  The cemetery
planetside is divided between Imperial and Confederation dead, Commercial
pilots & crew, and the hallowed hall for those who gave their lives for
others. Ripper�s pilots, & SBS still exists, operating a mixed assortment of
Solomani & Imperial Subcraft These include, an armed Imperial Fast Pinnace
(TL-15,40dtns, 6G), and an armed Puffin-class Ship�s boat (TL-13, 30dtns,
5G), a Buffaloe-class Jump-shuttle (Tl-15, 400 (2400)dtns J-4(1)/1G), and
three Modular Cutters (Tl-12, 50dtns, 3G), two imperial, one Solomani built.
Last but not least, the Bruno-class Tug (TL-11, 600dtns, 2G)., S&RS Mary
Elaine, sole survivor of her class in system.
<P>
<B>Sarcathon:</B> An agrarian poor world, the Mining interests of LSP were
attracted to the High metals, minerals, and rare earths surveyed here by the
IISS 2nd survey. For the Imperial contract, lowest bidder won, and LSP,LIC
got it on the cheap, beating out Rebields for the planet in 568 TI., and
even managed  the project at TL-9, so rich were the ores, the refinement
processes were minimum. But Sarcathon�s systems had their own hazards: Three
of her gas giants were severely hazardous to shipping.  Thus her C-class
orbital ports were among the few to offer refined Lhyd fuel.  Sarcathon�s
Tech decline saved her from the worst of fates, and although the other
satellite worlds in system suffered die offs, they have prospered under the
Civil Service bureau founded by the Free Traders who made this their home
port in the 1140�s.  Unlike Mueller, this world has been the economic giant
in this subsector for 70 years. Also, their Chirper population has remained
stable. The B-class law level relflects the starport�s security measures,
and those to approach the planet without being fired upon.

        The Commonwealth�s trade fleet & Commonwealth Troops have aided getting an
E-class port established on the following worlds: Vinhooks, Afrend, and Ilm.
This is the sum of the available aid they�ve been able to put out, aside
from teaching those on Vinhooks and Ilm how to operate the beacon and radio
equipment. Only on Afrend are their Commonwealth personnel manning the port.
On paper it looks like a pocket empire, in reality, Sarcathon is doing all
of the work.  An emissary arrived in system from the world of Czerniak in
Jayna, heralding a new age, and their promises sound good. The
Commonwealth�s Board of Trade has put it to referendum, but it seems someone
is expanding outwards, and civilization�s return is imminent.



<h3>Sarcathon (1202)</h3>

RADM Von Kessel�s damages repaired, his next venture was the scouting out of
Syrs Subsector �s former Hi Population centers believed to still have life.
First, Sarcathon (which Czerniak had contacted and wished to include in the
vision of "Margaret�s dream"); then lying J-3 to spinward from Sarcathon,
Exage, the site of a former hi-tech Naval base belonging to the Imperial
197th fleet/1197th Reserve fleet, Then J-4 rimwards, Syrs, former subsector
capital, also, like Exageformerly TL-15; last, paying a second visit to the
TED of Yerhen, J-3 to trailing from Syrs, back towards Czerniak.
It seemed to RADM Von Kessel�s enemies back on Solee in the Admiralty
(namely the jealous former Lucan remnants, including Solee Navy CNO ADM
Eshraa bint Reine) his string of successes had no end. The Syrs expedition
would prove that even Von Kessel�s gunboat diplomacy and heralding
Margaret�s Dream" would have its nay- Sayers, and some TEDs who�d be less
than impressed with Solee�s claim as her heirs. Unbeknownst to General Otto
Adraskaar, head of Soleean Imperial Securitat (SIS), Von Kessel had seduced
his personal SIS commissar, and she was falsifying reports on his "political
correctness".
<P>

The Commonwealth of Sarcathon (0716/Syrs D-9637AB-8 C: 2 304) a high gravity
cored world (1.42 G), was agriculturally poor, but had gone from being a
mere company owned mining world to a TL-8 industrial world during the
collapse. Her former C-class orbital port was a ruin, a shadow of its former
self, but tech decline from TL-9 had not been a hard fall. The population
had replaced the corporate board with a civil service bureaucratic
Government. Sarcathon had become, like Mueller of Shenk subsector had been,
a haven for Free Traders, save here, and they WERE the government!
Sarcathon� s Commonwealth had a small space force, some 6 large ships, and
18 smaller ones. Of these large ships, 5 were Spear-class Monitors (TL-9,
1ktn, NJ/1G), purchased in prewar days a sustainable SDB�s for the system.
Her one large jump-capable ship was a marooned Chauncy Smith-class Bulk
freighter (TL-10, 10ktn, J-1/1G) the SS Clersor-Clipper, is the flagship for
her mercantile commonwealth. Sarcathon� s other ships include 8 Lancet-class
SDB�s (TL-9, 200dtns, NJ/1G), and her four smaller Jump ships are A
Shambalator-class Close Escort (TL-15, 600dtns, J2/3G)SS Ulysses, Two armed
Petty-class freighters (TL-10, 400dtns, J1/1G),  the SS Black Nile�s
Daughter, & SS Capricorn�s Caprice, and a Wilds Trader-freighter (TL-12,
800dtns, J3/2G), SS Siobhan�s Starduster.
<P>
From the Sarcathians, Von Kessel got a good glimpse into the state of the
Main. Ritaboll (0717/ X-35A669-3 Ni Wa B904) a water world, had been reduced
to Balkanized TEDs on various islands, and had fallen below early industrial
tech standards. A cruel TED, who kept the Droyne minority oppressed, and had
shot at their ships before, ruled Yerhen (0818/X-37476C-4 Ag  D: 1 703 ).
They recommended he shun them as well. On Exageand Syrs, they could offer
little current data. EXAGE� s TEDs had Balkanized down to city states within
what had been once nation states, and a "might makes right" attitude
prevailed the high gravity world. Syrs was little better, but at least the
level of warfare hadn�t ruined the planet�s ecosphere. Due to Vampire ships
trapped in the Strat (0318/X-9BA000-0 Ba Fl Wa 004) & Ajjeig (0518/
X-325000-0 Ba 004) systems neither had been visited for a decade now.
Several planets had collapsed to the Stone Age, Frallsford (0516/ X-46276B-0
404), and the shunned world of Yeroltoy (0513/ X-A4376B-0 D: 0 B935 ), where
even the normally Mystical machine adept Droyne had been reduced to
barbarity, and were violently anti-human xenophobes as well. The planet�s
Klan (0112/ X-79788B-9 B800)and Waroh (0512/ X78986E-9 B820) had survived
with higher tech than others they�d encountered, even EXAGE, owing in part
to no gas giants, but were Balkanized TEDs more intent on each other, and
only united versus possible Vampire incursions.

<P>
Their paranoia made them too
risky for the commonwealth�s precious few ships to trade with. Their ships
traveled as far as the E-class port on Ranb (0311/ E-766788-6 Ag D: 2 802)),
where the former colony of Dachnis� folk had centralized things in a
Socialist Totalitarian state, to the E-class port on Babellet (0412/
E-757668-5 Ag Ni B104), an agrarian world run by fairly benevolent TEDs.
Ranb was no longer on their itinerary since they had nearly lost a ship
there five years ago, thanks to the Guild putting ideas into the
Ranb-Soviet�s minds. Most of their trade was conducted with the desert world
of Vinhooks (0613/ 440420-5 De Lo Ni 203), the Vilani-style Impersonal
Bureau of pre-industrial Afrend (0614/6768BB-3 801 ), and the pre-stellar
industrial world of Ilm (0715/X-6628CA-5  315). Sarcathon was willing to
join the empire, but had little to contribute to any fleet efforts.
Czerniak�s diplomats assured them they could have their C-class starport
rebuilt within two years, and a market for their TL-8 goods, especially
military ones, to trailing was in demand (Mostly to those few TL-6 client
states that had acknowledged the will of Solee). Czerniak had opened a
colony/ salvage world on Rebields (1708/ Jayna) six years ago, and a second
on Inftow (1607) in 1200.  J-1 Trade with Yerhen and J-2 trade from
Sarcathon would greatly ease burdens (costs to keep supplied in food and
materials) on both. In return, TL-9 parts and machinery from Galines and
Solee carried on TKHL transports would tie them into the empire.  Homage
to Empress Ramstattan, and the protection of the Solee Imperial fleet were
small prices to pay. As if to quell doubts, representatives from Czerniak�s
version of Ling Standard products arrived two weeks after  RADM Von Kessel,
and relinquished their holdings to the Commonwealth of Sarcathon (purely a
political fait d� accompli), and the two freighters she arrived with brought
spare parts for their aging Spear class monitors & Lancet SDB�s.
<P>
The Sarcathians looked at this with both a sigh of relief (now they didn't
have to do all of this "foreign" aide alone) and since guarantees were made
on the autonomy of their system itself, and the Soleeans seemed to mean
business and keeping their end up, the vote was barely contested. By August,
construction crews from Czerniak began to arrive to facilitate the creation
of an orbital C-class port. It was half completed by December 20th, thanks
in part to its modular construction. At the current pace, it looks to be
completed by mid June of 1203. So far, the market for their TL-8 goods has
been faithfully kept tot railing. Who is actiually buying this stuff, the
Sarcathi don't know, but the TL-5 spares and machinery for Ilm and Vinhooks
has been passing through their hands as middle men from trailing, making a
tidy profit ( From Walager & Kunni in Jayna).
