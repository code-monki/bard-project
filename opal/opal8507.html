Stoyben is home to a very large body of platinum and
osmium ore, and is mined by companies from nearby
<a href="opal8608.html">Petrarch</A>.  Mining is made difficult by the permafrost
conditions that make the local rock resistant to
mechanical excavation, and explosives and mining
lasers are used to blast large areas of the surface.
The world is pitted and scarred by such strip mining
operations, and large areas are unsafe to traverse on
foot or in ground effect vehicles. Because the entire
world is essentially a working mine, movement across
the surface is heavily regulated by the Colonial
Council. Permits are required for any movement beyond
the downport or the adjacent communities, and
trespassing or illegal ownership of explosives are
severely punished. The scout base on Stoyben is used
by RISS as a training facility for planetologists and
surveyors, who use played parts of the surface for
hands on training in their demanding fields.
