  <P>
Saxe is populated by the remnants of a Pre-Maghiz
Daryen scientific outpost.  The entire population
lives in an ancient TL16 submerged city floating in
the worlds largest ocean. The outpost was originally
established, according the few records that survived
the Maghiz on Daryen, to study the beginnings of life
on this nascent planet.
 <P>
Stranded, the population eventually lost most memory
of their homeworld, except for a few scraps of Daryen
culture and ideological underpinnings, which
eventually became a quasi-religion based upon rote
recital and ritual. Fortunately, their TL16 machinery
proved exceptionally reliable, requiring only
repetitive maintenance practices to keep running.
Unfortunately, the loss of knowledge would not allow
the construction of new machinery, nor prevent major
catastrophes.  That the colony survived as long as it
had is a testament to Daryen engineering prowess.
 <P>
The Third Imperium did not contact Saxe until 308, and
literally stumbled over the inhabitants.  The
Imperiums low TL (12-13) prevented them from offering
much in the way of technical assistance, and there was
much debate within IISS over the world's disposition
in relation to both the Imperium and the Daryen
Confederacy.  In the end, an IISS contact team was
permanently stationed in the city to observe but
otherwise not interfere with the inhabitants.  The
Daryen Confederacy also posted a team of advisors to
the planetary government early on; but friction with
the locals led to its recall, and the Confederacy
largely ignored them until the Collapse.
 <P>
The IISS teams observed the progressive deterioration
of the city, and by the Fourth Frontier War, the
Scouts had made contingency plans for evacuating the
population in case of a widespread life support
failure.  But the events of the Post-Collapse period
actually saved it.  Or as one scout official put it,
damned by disaster and saved by another.
 <P>
Two trends rescued the colony: the Regency's
advancement to TL16, and the Daryen Renaissance.  Over
the last 50 years, Regency and Daryen engineers have
figured out and managed to refurbish or replace many
of the cities failing systems.  The landing pad on the
cities upper hemisphere has been expanded into a full
starport. And there is no talk of either expanding the
facility, or of replacing with a larger facility of
new construction.
 <P>
The people of Saxe had long cultivated a blase
attitude towards their predicament, a benign
unwillingness to delve further into the unknown of
their own environment.  This attitude was further
reinforced by the inability of Antebellum researchers
and engineers to understand the city.  But the
increasing capacity and confidence of the Regency and
Daryen teams rebuilding the city has collapsed that
indifference.
Technical schools have been established with Daryen
assistance, and their has been a resurgence of study
in Daryen culture among the young. Older Saxians still
cultivate passivity among themselves, but have been
instrumental by encouraging their children to obtain
an education and leaving behind the "bubble" mentality
that has long retarded the world.
