Formerly known as Talon. Talon had been colonised in
waves by both human and Vargr settlers. Animosity
between the two groups led to the creation of
exclusive nation-states for each, centered around
large arcologies built near the world's scattered
seas. Sporadic fighting created a spiral of atrocity
and retribution, and the nations armed themselves with
an array of weapons of mass destruction. The United
Followers of Augurgh annexed the world in 1112, but
were unable to bring any kind of peace between the
warring factions. The Imperial Civil War attracted
oppurtunistic corsairs, who used the world as a
forward base for raids on Domain of Deneb shipping in
the Millions Bisector.

Despite warnings from the DoD, the planetary
population did not seriously heed the threat of Virus,
and the world was caught unawares in late 1142. An
infected bulk transport released a Doomslayer strain
into the local datanet, and when the rampage was over
four days later, the world had been shattered beyond
repair. Those not killed in the initial rampage of
deadly machinery died of starvation and exposure in
the billions.  Survivors abandoned the arcologies and
fled into the wilderness, their numbers winnowed
further by the shock of adaptation. Virus literally
bombed this world back to the Stone Age, though local
warlords enforce their power with dwindling stocks of
TL-11 weaponry. These groups are very xenophobic, and
Million's free traders avoid the world at all costs.
