Coshecawat has long been a mystery to historians and
xenologists. The world is a hollowed out moon of a
larger world known as Serkhet (Y9C6000-0). The world
is inhabited by humans, though no one knows how they
got there, or where they come from, though indications
are that they have been here for about 40,000 years.
The world itself is a fairly typical stony body, but
it has been hollowed into a series of concentric
spheres, each of them self contained with self
supporting gardens, small lakes that are constantly
recirculated, and habitations for people. The
technology that produced these features appears to be
high stellar, though few intact artifacts have been
found to confirms this. Some archaeologists alledge
that another major race or even jump capable humans
existed before the other major races attained
starflight, but this has not been verified. The
reasons for the abandonment of its people have never
been determined. Local legends simply state that some
kind of stellar catastrophe wiped out their
civilisation, and they alone survived.
<P>
The inhabitants simply call themselves the Cawat or
"People" in their native language. Initial surveys by
the IISS missed them, as they were confined to the
deep core of their world. A group of researchers
stumbled on to them while trying to determine the
source of elevated CO2 readings. When first discovered
they were subsisting on a few surviving systems,
including the decrepit solar power network, farming
crops and forging metal implements out of scavenged
metals. Only sixty thousand had survived the long
isolation, though they seem unsuperstitious about the
Scout Contact team. Nevertheless IISS interdicted the
world in 506, largely to prevent exploitation by
unscruplous academics. For their part the Cawat only
wanted to be left alone, with a little outside
assistance to keep vital systems maintained or
replaced.
<P>
In recent years reports have surfaced that the Scouts
were less than honest in their publicly released
reports of the people. The Cawat turned out to be more
advanced than initially thought, and their world in
better shape. Several agencies of the Imperial
government used the world as a storage or transhipment
point for various materials, and the Navy built
ammunition and supply depots to support military
operations against the Zhodani. Rumors have also
surfaced that a Viral holding facility has been
constructed in a remote part of the system, but these
have proven difficult to verify.
