<B>Lieber Subsector:</B>

 subsector had an 1116 population of 3.4
billion. The highest tech level is 13 at Shtiem, Ezh
Bova, and Lieber.  In 1202 the population was 12.6
billion, again mostly due to the Exodus. The highest
tech level is E at Shtiem.
<P>
Lieber Subsector is defended by the Zhodani 90th Fleet
from its headquarters at Lieber (1404). The 90th
missed most of the Fifth Frontier War, only being
deployed at the last moment to repulse an Imperial
thrust towards Cronor, and it suffered heavy losses in
doing so. The fleet is more famous for its operations
in the Third and Fourth wars, where it carved out a
reputation as the "Ballerina 90th" for its ability to
dance around Imperial defenses and patrols while on
deep commerce raids against Imperial shipping.
<P>
Unlike the neighboring 116th, the 90th is fiercely
loyal to the Consulate and the surviving naval command
structure. Indeed its rank-and-file personnel strongly
resent the situation in Shivva, and the fleet has
begun to deploy to positions that will deter any
attempt at expansion or secession by the 116th or its
backers.
<P>
<B>Shtiem (0910):</B> Shtiem was a popular destination for
Regency researchers in the early years of the Psionic
Reforms. The world has one of the top rated psionic
instruction and research universities in the entire
Consulate, and a steady stream of students visited
here in the 1130s and 40s to not only learn psionic
arts, but also the practical art of teaching, and
administering psionic learning facilities. While not
as popular in recent years, as the Regency established
its own network of psionic instruction facilities, it
maintained close academic ties to its former students
and the institutions they founded, and academic
exchanges were quite common.
<P>
<B>Jiaster (1209):</B> In the Pre-Collapse period Non-Zhodani
were cautioned against visiting the dictatorship of
Jiatsar. The planet was formerly ruled bythe
non-psionic noble family Denzfalpepistebr, which was
noteworthy for its xenophobia. Off-worlders were
required to wear silly and colorful costumes that
made easily identifiable to local security forces and
the local population. Unfortunately for its rulers,
these restrictions made meeting Non-Zhodani a
thrilling if forbidden act, and the family was finally deposed
in 1145 after being repeatedly cited for its failure
to maintain the psychological uniformity of its
citizenry. A council of several subordinate families
was promoted in their place, but apparently did little
better as governors. The Exodus has swelled the
population, and the world now teeters on anarchy.
