</DL><P>
The DeMarche family is extremely popular, and has
defeated all challenges and referendums to its power.
The family was founded by a military hero in the
Second Frontier War, who translated his power into a
very militaristic culture. Qevarians are all members
of a world quasi-military structure, and every member
is assigned to lagers made out of their local
communities. Individual rights are less important than
unit cohesion and communal fidelity; everyone wears
uniforms that mark their status and rank. Strict
discipline is maintained by officers, with severe
punishments for minor infractions.
<P>
Because of the importance of uniforms in this strict
society, clothing has become the main medium for
artistic expression. The result is what some
travellers have referred to as a planet full of drag
queens. Depending upon the style and period, uniforms
range from strict minimalist to flowery sequined
costumes of doubtful utility. Feathers, sequins,
bells, ornate buttons, ribbon and many materials not
normally included in military attire have all made
their way into the local haberdashery.  During local
festivals the locals reach an especially sublime level
carnivalesque excess that seriously offends even the
most liberal and nonphilistine tastes. No matter how
outrageous or low the local taste, the locals take
great loving pride in their attire, and it is a
criminal offense to mock or criticise their tastes.
