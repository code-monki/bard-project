Formerly known as Graek, Djaelervangak is the longest
continually settled high population world in Deneb
Sector. The world was settled around -1840 by Provence
sector immigrants. The world's main continent
underwent a major breakup only a few million years
ago, and most of its dry land are within a few hundred
miles of each other, seperated only by narrow, shallow
seas teeming with life. The sea is the worlds main
source for food and income, and shipbuilding is a time
honored major industry.
<P>
The tropical climate and bountiful resources seems to
have instilled paradise syndrome in the original
colonists, who burned their ships and have been
content with just the primitive beginnings of an
industrial society. In contrast to the normal tumult
of Vargr society, the world had enjoyed unusually
stable government and social structures for most of
its history. Early in its history it had established
the custom of "sponsoring" disaffected younger Vargr
for offworld education or career advancement. This not
only eliminated troublesome dissidents and agitators,
it created an offworld diaspora of more skilled Vargr
that retained their homeworld ties, often sending
money or resources that could not be obtained locally.
<P>
The Collapse altered this fine balance. The loss of
offworld contact led to a social breakdown. The
world's ancient elected monarchy was overthrown in a
coup in 1148, and fighting between would be
successors. A religious dictatorship, whose name
replaced the world's antebellum one, arose in 1155,
and have plunged the world into a nightmare. These
Vargr are adherents of a crazy messianic cult that has
terrorised its neighbors with often genocidal attacks.
These Vargr are increasingly opposed and stymied by
the naval forces and primitive aircraft of the
Khankael League, which is organised around the
remnants of the old Royal Bureaucracy, and whose
invocation of the storied past and promises of
restoring the order of the ancien regime has rallied a
growing part of the local population to its banner.
Most fighting is done at sea between coal-burning
ironclads and cloth-covered propeller driven zeppelins
and aircraft. Direct attacks by troops are eschewed
for bombing with incendiaries, chemical gas canisters
and primitive biological weaponry.
