<B>Shial  Subsector:</B>
<P>

The subsectors 1116 Population was 190 Million, and
the highest tech level was 14 at Jdieshaqra and
Ibiedl. The 1202 Population is 640 Million, and the
highest tech level is the same. The subsector is named
after an Admiral Shialtlasche, who commanded a Zhodani
Fleet in the First Frontier War.
<P>
Shial Subsector is defended by the famed 7th Fleet
from its base at Ibiedl (1807). The 7th is most famous
for helping spearhead the capture of Porozlo in the
Third Frontier War, which helped end the war to the
Consulate's advantage. The 7th participated in
operations in Vilis Subsector in the Fifth Frontier
War, support attacks against Vilis, Tanoose and
Frenzie. The fleet suffered severe losses at Frenzie
in 1109, and again while defending Narval against the
Imperial 193rd Fleet the following year. The fleet,
which had previously been stationed in Cronor/Spinward
Marches, was sent to Shial to recuperate, changing
places with the 12th Fleet.
<P>
Currently the 7th acts as an "aggressor" force in
wargames with other Zhodani fleets sent here for
training. Since the Collapse the fleet has mostly
replicated Vampire Fleets composed of mixed Imperial
and Vargr equipment and tactics, but added Zhodani
equipment about ten years ago as a contingency. This
latter capacity has been recently expanded, as the
spector of civil fighting increasingly dominates local
defense planning.
 <P>
Shial was only lightly populated when the Third
Imperium and the Zhodani first contacted each other.
In the wake of rising tensions, the Zhodani military
took over many of the subsectors empty worlds, and
converted them into marshalling grounds, test ranges
and training facilities for operations against the
Imperials. Most of the local population remains
employed either by the military, or in support of it.
The few agricultural worlds that are found here sell
most of their products directly to the Naval
Commissary for consumption by its personnel.  Shial's
relative security made it attractive to the navy as an
R&R facility for its fleets, as well as a peaceful
station for units undergoing battle recovery and/or
major reorganisation.
<P>
The Zhodani Civil War has created massive turmoil
locally. The murky information that has so far reached
Shial has nevertheless shocked many into paralysis,
and there are endless desultory debates within
government chambers as to the best course of action.
Fortunately cooler heads have prevailed, and the
subsector council is belatedly acting to help
allieviate the refugee crisis, and draw up contingency
plans for local defence. The subsector has made clear
its loyalty to the Consulate, and its bases have been
offered up to Iadr Nsobl as staging and training
facilities for possible military expansion.
<P>
<B>Pepraet (2202):</B> has been dominated by a stern military
junta for the last 300 years. The world suffered an
asteroid strike in 907 that devastated it, killing
about a quarter of the population. The Zhodani Navy
has a major base on the world, which survived with
only minor damage, and were reluctant to evacuate the
local population. The local military took control
afterwards, looking to both recovery and
reconstruction, and keeping the local population from
interfering with the naval base. Laws regulating life
support are harsh, and the population is kept under
heavy surveillance by the local Tavrchedl and civilian
monitors.  Civilian refugees from the Zhodani Core
have been barred from the surface, and those that have
attempted to land anyway have either been
"disappeared" or fired upon with deadly intent without
prior warning.
