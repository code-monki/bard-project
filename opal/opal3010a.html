  Schotz is a very xenophobic world, ruled by the "Grand Poobah," who united
  the balkanized world shortly after the Collapse.  The Grand Poobah, who is a
  remnant, still rules, at the extreme old age of 138.  Though he makes very
  rare appearances, he has encouraged an elaborate series of public and private
  rituals for the selection and administration of his government.  It's
  suspected by the RCES contact teams that he makes heavy use of anagathics.<P>
  
  Prior to 1203, the pronounced xenophobia of Schotz resulted in effectively
  zero contact with the outside galaxy.  The Free Trader Network and the
  Mercantile Guild have both been rebuffed by attacks upon ships attempting
  contact on landing on the mainworld. Attacks are always preceded by ONE clear
  warning by radio broadcast.  No other communications are accepted.<P>
  
  The first Dawn League contact missions were rebuffed with a terse warning
  to move in no closer to the mainworld, or there would be an attack, with no
  further warnings.  With the establishment of the Reformation Coalition, it
  was feared that Schotz  might be under the dictatorship of a TED, or worse,
  Virus, so a series of stardust and moonshadow missions were authorized.  The
  information gained paved the way for the contact missions that were undertaken
  in early 1203.  The missions were outstandingly successful, and though Schotz
  remains very xenophobic, resulted in the establishment of a Hiver temporary
  base near the outermost of the 2 gas giants in the system.  Consequently,
  this led to the establishment of a regular J-3 trade route connecting the
  Reformation Coalition with the Hiver "Stepping-Stone" Client State of Sitah.<P>
  
  Entry into the inner system is still restricted, by agreement of the
  Reformation Coalition Assembly and the Hive Federation representatives.
  Registered Reformation Coalition vessels are prohibited from entry into the
  system beyond the Hiver Temporary Base, as the base will notify any ship
  attempting to do such, though no actions will be taken by the Hivers to
  prevent such.<P>

<B>The Following Information is for the Referee Only</B>
  
  <h3>Government Data</h3>

  Schotz was the site of a Psionic Institute in the days of the Last Imperium.
  The Grand Poobah was an extrodinarily gifted psionic and organized the various
  psionic cells to maintain order during the chaotic period of the Collapse.
  The "elaborate rituals" are various methods of displaying psionic ability
  (the private ones) and nonsense (the public ones), but the whole thing is
  effectively turning into a genuine religion.<P>
  
  The Grand Poobah actually died in late 1193, not long after a Hiver delegation
  came, attempting recontact.  The Grand Vizier feared that chaos would reappear
  and only reinforced the existing xenophobia to unprecedented heights, out of
  fear of the discovery and relavation of the truth.  He has kept the Grand
  Poobah in a low berth and has arranged the body in a seemingly ceremonial way
  and had a small speaker connected near the head of the Grand Poobah.  A
  microphone line leads from the back of the "Altar of the Grand Poobah" to the
  Grand Viziers personal meditation chamber, where he issues the occassional
  proclamation to "renounce the sins of my generation's past."  The glass is
  just
  murky enough to make it very difficult to spot the truth, even when in the
  chambers of the Grand Poobah (which itself is a massive cathedralesque
  building).  The Grand Vizier is (or rather was) the sole attendant to the
  Grand Poobah.<P>

  <H3>Special Notes for Schotz</h3>
  Starport personnel have recently discovered various processes
  (electrolysis amongst others) for refining fuel, though they still have no
  method of spaceship construction.<P>
  
 The Grand Poohbah remains very popular and the cult that has risen around
  him has only been endorsed by the Grand Vizier.  It's thought he'll declare
  it the state religion soon.<P>
  
The Grand Vizier has recently went through several bouts of illness and
  though recovered, has begun fearing his own death and the subsequent chaos
  that
  he fears will engulf the planet.  He has almost depleted the Grand Poobah's
  supply of anagathics and is desperate for more.  He has decided to endorse
  a *very* limited contact with the Hivers, by allowing them to establish a
  temporary base and trade route stop at the outermost of the gas giants. The
  SDB is occassionally staffed entirely by the "Poobah Protectors" and pays a
  visit to the Hiver Temp Base, where they've made a formal request for a
  clandestine acquisition of anagathics.  The Hivers have agreed to the request,
  though they don't the true reason, and to keep it off the records, are looking
  into hiring freelancers (from either the Reformation Coalition or the Free
  Trader Network) to ferry and/or acquire sources of anagathics.<P>

<H3>Creator's Note</h3>
  Here's a PoT style writeup I've done for Schotz.  The Hiver trade route will
  formalized in 1203 after Schotz agrees to allow a Hiver Temporary Base in the
  outer system. Thus, the old data isn't voided.  As explempifies the New Era,
  the galaxy and life rolls on.  <P>
  
  I figuring the scout base has some permanent defenses, some laser satellite
  type things... maybe even a fixed particle accelerator.<P>
  
  The Space Force isn't normally allowable (as Schotz pre-collapse TL was 5,
  too... they just lost 190,000,000 people since 1119) but I'm doing an
  exception.<P>
