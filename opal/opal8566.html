Formerly known as Oluk Dzas. This world was an
important trade nexus in antebellum times. Virus
destroyed its main starport and knocked the world all
the way down to TL 3. Despite having the best starport
in the subsector, the locals do not have the skills or
the resources to maintain it. Therefore the locals
have ceded the facility to a coalition of offworld
traders and skilled workers who maintain the facility
to provide badly needed maintenance for the subsectors
surviving trade ships. The old extrality zone is the
border of this autonomous region, and is patrolled by
mercenary soldiers. The majority of the council that
oversees the facility are from Gabrael, which provides
most of the funding and offworld spare parts. The
local Vargr are divided between several local
warlords, and are generally too poorly armed and
organised to seriously threaten the starport;
nevertheless the council usually pays a small tribute
in the form of precious metals and useful salvage.
