Travellers emerging from jumpspace are always greeted
by the sickle shape of this world. Crescent closely
orbits its primary, and insystem bound ships
frequently precipitate at an optimum angle above the
terminator.  Its half full appearance must have struck
the romantic fancy of the early Solomani colonists,
and inspired the world's name.
<P>
Crescent is tidally locked with its primary, Glare,
and its daylight temperatures exceed 400 degrees
celsius. The darkside is a chilly -250 degrees. The
twilight zone holds most, but not all, of the major
settlements. The worlds very thin atmosphere is
desiccated of all water, and the wind picks up
atomised rock particles from either side of the
planet, making it impossible to breate without
atomisation. The local geological record indicates
that the world once supported life, but it has been
dead for about 2 billion years.
<P>
Crescent was settled around -250.  Like so many of its
neighbors in the Reach,  the settlers were Rule of Man
refugees fleeing the onset of the Long Night.  The
colonists arrived here in a simple sublight ship, with
no other means to leave this inhospitable system, and
simply resigned themselves to trying to eke out a life
on the only sizeable body that could support their
efforts.
<P>
The colonists were able to construct and maintain
simple underground colonies, with a simple sustainable
industrial technology.  But shortages of organics and
water for agriculture, and leadership differences
between conflicting ideologies, slowly drove the
settlements apart from one another.  Some military
conflict occured during the initial breakup, but
irreperable damage inflicted on a pair of settlements
by heavy artillery quickly dissuaded further violence,
and subsequent secessions were carried out by
referendum.
<P>
An unwritten code of conduct evolved out of this
peaceful dissolution, followed by all the attendant
parties and factions, that forbade all violence save
as ritualised combat between designated forces within
specified battlefields or arenas, and made the
settlements off-limits to all weapons.  By -210, a
written set of accords codified these restrictions,
and expanded rules on hospitality (each habitat is an
open, neutral territory for all residents, regardless
of affiliation), emergency aid (citizens will render
aid to all persons in distress), life support use and
intercolony policing.  These rules were enforced by
the threat that anyone violating them in a clear and
unequivocal manner would be placed outside the law,
and be subject to hostilities from every other party
on the planet. The threat of punitive attack led to
the creation of "outlaw" colonies within either the
day or darksides, where expelled colonists resided in
exile until they were either forgiven by their
communities, or they died.
<P>
These restrictions led to division of the entire
twilight zone from pole to pole into different
quadrants, centered around every five degree change in
latitude. Colonies within these zones are termed
"Parallels", and are named according to their latitude
and whether they are on the eastern or western
terminator (example: Parallel 40 N/W is a colony at
forty degrees north on the western terminator).
<P>
The IISS recontacted this world in 287, and were
suprised at how well the indigenous population was
getting along. Offworld contact was infrequent until
late in the antebellum period. Aside from a few
low-tech industrial goods, the locals had little to
trade, and only needed a few selected trade goods to
satisfy their own needs. Offworld contact was
complicated by heavy-handed Imperial and Zhodani
attempts at influencing the various local factions,
which generally gained nothing and alienated the
locals to the point of isolationism.
<P>
The world's main importance since the end of the
Fourth Frontier War has been as a trade conduit for
traffic moving between the Florian League and the
Marches interface.  The B-class starport is an orbital
facility in geosynchronous orbit over the darkside
equator, at an equal distance from each Parallel to
maintain unity. The world is highly hospitable to ship
crews and travellers regardless of nationality or
race. Life remains hard for most of the locals, and
the settlements have been carefully investing money
from customs and port fees to steadily improve the
local standard of living.
<P>
Crescent has become a major psionic training center
since the Collapse, and hosts instructors and
researchers from both the Regency and the Zhodani
Consulate.
