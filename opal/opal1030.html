<B>CIN/Aubaine, 1/IV, 1202</B><p>

<UL>McKenzie Holdings, a salvage company registered out of Aubaine, has
formally established a legal claim to Adrian (0432/Aubaine; new UWP is
D426112-9).  The new starport is class D, and was expanded from a former
class G spaceport.  The new starport has a few repair bays capable of
handling small ships (200 tons or less).  Refined fuel is available at the
starport, as well as lodging and food.  Currently, about 30 sentients 
permanently live at McKenzie Station.  <P>

McKenzie Holdings has provided RCES with a small facility for use as a
scout base, at no cost to RCES.  They have also formally petitioned for
status as a client-state of the RC.  </UL>

<P>
<HR>


McKenzie Holdings makes most of its money at Adrian by salvaging the relic
TL-14 equipment.  They also make some money servicing the ships going
between Fija and Eos and Nike Nimbus (as the shortest route from Fija to
either of these worlds is by way of Adrian).  <P>

  
McKenzie Station is mostly underground, and is divided into several 
"blocks" (sections).  These blocks were not built all at the same time.  
Rather, a block was built or upgraded as needed.  Tunnels average 2.8 
meters high and 2.5 meters wide (7 m^2 cross-sectional area).  <P>

McKenzie Station is comprised of the following "blocks" (sections): <P>

As stated previously, McKenzie Station (a class D starport) was expanded 
from a former class G spaceport.  The former space port consisted of two 
runways, six basic hangar pits (see below) in a radial arrangement, an 
underground fuel bunker (see below) and a control/administration building. <P>  

In early 1201, they renovated all six of the hangar pits and used a 
"seeker" (modified scout/courier) for the power supply, sensors & commo 
gear, and living quarters.  They used up a small relic TL-14 fusion 
reactor for the 1.152 MW of power needed whenever the "seeker" had to 
leave.   <P>

In mid-1201, they finished the first vehicle hangar & repair bay, giving 
them a permanent power supply and living quarters, regardless of however 
many ships were there.  They renovated the underground fuel bunker and 
finished a fuel refinery.   <P>

In late 1201, they enclosed one of the hangar pits, which allowed for 
repairs or maintenance to be performed on a ship while in a "shirt 
sleeves" environment.  They also finished the second vehicle hangar & 
repair bay as well as two apartment blocks.   <P>

In early 1202, they enclosed another hangar pit, and they finished another 
apartment block and the TL-12 command center.  They also excavated another 
six basic hangar pits (in another radial arrangement) on the other side of 
a runway.  They decided to give three of the new hangars to RCES for use 
as a scout base.  They also finished another underground fuel bunker. <P>

<h3>Command Center</h3>

Because of the critical need for high-tech sensors and communications 
gear, they built the command center using TL-12 components instead of the 
more readily available TL-9 components.  Also, they included a small TL-12 
fuel refinery to serve as a backup refinery in case the primary is ever 
unavailable.  <P>

"Rocky" is the owner of McKenzie Holdings and is the closest thing to an
actual "commander" they have at McKenzie Station (she would describe her
job as "chief fire-stomper and all-around troubleshooter").  She is seldom
without one of her pets (they look like a cross between a flying squirrel
and a bat).  <P>

Joshua has just recently joined his sister, Maria, in this venture on
Adrian.  Joshua (he *hates* his tac-code) will usually be the one to
perform the necessary public relations, going to Aubaine, Aurora, or
wherever else needed.  <P>
