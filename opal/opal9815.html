The Grudovo Pendant is a j-1 cluster of 13 worlds that
connects Tobia/Trojan Reach with neighboring
Usher/Reft. Originally a cluster of little economic
presence or importance, its economic value has risen
in proportion with the rising volume of trade that
passes between Lintl and Tobia.

<P>
Dimorus was originally settled during the Rule of Man
period by a far ranging Solomani colonisation mission.
Cut off by the Long Night, the local government barely
managed to keep the habitation domes functioning
through thousands of years of isolation. When
recontacted by the the Third Imperium in 340, the
local ruling council accepted its sovereignty and
offworld trade, but their ability to maintain their
original tech levels continued to deteriorate.  The
Ihatei invasion of 1119 punctured the worlds feeble
defenses, and the locals panicked. When the Regency
reclaimed the world in 1132, the First Regeny
convinced the government of Berg to make Dimorus a
protectorate, and aid in its recovery.
