In antebellum times Quanah was a major mining world.
Mines were scattered across the surface, and the world
was divided between several petty city-states, none of
which numbered more than a few hundred people. Vargr
raids in neighboring Lamas created refugee flows that
crowded through the world's meager starport, a trend
accelerated by the Collapse. Refugee camps swelled the
local population to almost hundred times and strained
local resources. While some refugees moved on to other
worlds, the majority ended up staying, eventually
assimilating the original. The major cities sprawl out
of the old camps, with the core still inhabited by die
hard Human and Vargr refugees. Agriculture has become
the mainstay of the economy, though most of the
population is locked up in urban professional jobs.
Vargr organised crime has a heavy presence on the
world, virtually controlling the inner cities.
