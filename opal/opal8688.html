Despite its small size and limited land surface, Veldt
is an agricultural powerhouse. Warm temperatures and
ample moisture allow for the growing of several crops
in a normal calendar year. Most of these crops are
shipped to worlds like Lilad and Giranima, and the
farmers make a good living in selling natural fruits
and vegetables to worlds that otherwise depend upon
manufactured or basic hydroponic crops for most of
their foodstuffs. Nearly ninety percent of the worlds
exports are food products, and the commerce this
attracts requires the presence of an A-class starport.
<P>
To facilitate productivity, most of the population
lives in in scattered communities, with few cities
above a few hundred thousand people. The exception to
this is Highport, which has a population of four
million and a tech level of 13. Highport's population
originally brokered food shipments for sale on the
interstellar market, but most of the Post-Collapse
trade between Deneb and worlds in Reft sector passes
through Veldt, and Highport's population has become
culturally distant from their cousins on the surface
as a result of income from this trade, which is more
lucrative than being the middleman for grain sales. In
1198 Highport's ruling council applied for home rule
status, a move bitterly opposed by the planetary
government.<P>

The scout base is built on top of the local Ancient
ruins. The site consists of a giant maze of twisting
paths carved out of the sandstone bedrock of a large
valley. The paths are open to the sky and range in
width from allowing two-lane vehicle traffic, down to
smaller than any known sentient lifeform. The paths
are ruler straight, without curves of any kind,
changing course through sharp corners set at right
angles. The pattern they form is intricate and goes
for hundreds of miles. The paths do not intersect,
twisting around one another, and eventually dead
ending at the edges of the valley. The purpose of this
maze is still unknown. And technology that precisely
cut them is more advanced than anything created by
Imperial science. Equally mysterious is the lack of
any deformation or faulting of the bedrock by normal
earth movements in the last 300,000 years, despite
several major earthquakes nearby in that time frame.
