Natoko is a pleasant world ruled by a military
dominated government known as the Proconsulate. Local
society has always been heavily dominated by
militarism, a situation that led to several antebellum
era confrontations between the Proconsulate and the
Imperial government. An Imperial Edict issued in 1081
prohibited the world from owning military vessels,
after a number of incidents on nearby worlds involving
Natoko's Planetary Navy. Since the Collapse this Edict
has been reinforced by the Regency Starship Shortage,
and there are rumors to the effect that the Ministry
of Shipping amuses itself by repeated monkeying around
with the production schedules of ships alloted by the
Regency to Natoko.  Much of the world's aggression has
been rechanneled into Frontier duty with the Navy or
RQS, though the Proconsulate's stated goal of
sponsoring new colonisation missions into the reopened
Frontier has some Regency officials worried.
<P>
Natoko's Ancient site was declassified in 1133 as part
of the "airclearing" program of removing Imperial era
secrecy. It has also served to prevent the Natoko
government from using the site for its own nefarious
purposes. The site apparently included artifacts that
enabled the Imperial government to better understand
the workings of force fields, which permitted the
reproduction and manufacture of Black Globes recovered
Knorbes (SM 1807). A number of other military
applications have been found, some still classified,
and the Regency Ministry of Interior and the Navy
station large numbers of security personnel to protect
the "cookie jar" from the Proconsulate and its agents.
