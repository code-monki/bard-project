The Grudovo Pendant is a j-1 cluster of 13 worlds that
connects Tobia/Trojan Reach with neighboring
Usher/Reft. Originally a cluster of little economic
presence or importance, its economic value has risen
in proportion with the rising volume of trade that
passes between Lintl and Tobia.<P>


<P>

Khaliki was originally Trojan Reach's prison world.
When Aslan forces overran the system in 1120, they
inadvertently set the prisoners free. While most of
the escaped convicts were recaptured, the prison's
security was too compromised to permit it to reopen in
its old role, and it has been shuttered ever since.
