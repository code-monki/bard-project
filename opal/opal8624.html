Daumier is an isolationist world inhabited by
recalcitrant millionaire miners. This aloofness is a
result of the enormous wealth that has been generated
by dredging th seafloor: Daumier has large deposits of
gold, silver and platinum group metals. These are
usually difficult to find normally, and they have
become even more valuable since the Collapse. Nearly
every member of the population is a millionaire at
least, and their wealth prices immigrants out of the
local real estate market, which is fine with the
locals. They are not very keen on sharing their wealth
with anyone, and the Regency government has a
difficult time collecting even the meager taxes
assessed against this world. The population is divided
between four seperate communities on four different
islands, and their populations are fairly aloof from
each other as well. The population does not take well
to interlopers, especially in areas of the seafloor
where mining is carried out, and the population is
well armed with military-grade weaponry (the listed
law level applies more to offworlders).
