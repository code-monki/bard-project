St. Genevieve was settled in antebellum times by a
group of reclusive millionaires from Sansterre. Their
peaceful retreat became a major battleground in the
four way war between the subsectors major powers.
Almost two thousand local inhabitants are party to
about one hundred thousand troops from Neubayern, New
Home, Sansterre and Amondiage fight over this dry
rock, policed by twenty thousand RPKF troops manning
the large DMZs that crisscross the surface like a
chess board. The fighting is mostly desultory, and
most of the offworld troops would rather be sent home.
Recent negotiations between Sansterre and Neubayern
have resulted in a de facto peace treaty between them,
and many of Amondiages myriad nations have indicated a
desire to negotiate as well. New Home's continued
intransigence prevents a final settlement, and
desertion is beginning to sap the local units of their
strength as the war continues to drag on.
