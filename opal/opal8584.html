Jehun was settled in 590 as a resource colony for
Rhinom (Deneb 0717). Cooler temperatures and more
fertile soils made it a primary breadbasket for the
more industrialised homeworld.  But the preferrential
treatment and low prices demanded by the cartels and
government eventually alienated the colonists, who
revolted in 1007 for home rule, but were crushed with
the assistance of Imperial Marines. Rhinom craftily
coopted many would be rebels through bribery and
appointment to positions in the government. A strong
garrison force prevented a relapse into violence.
Nevertheless, Jehunians continued to prefer home rule,
and Rhinom could not prevent the Representational
Reforms, and independence was achieved in 1160.
<P>
Relations between the two worlds have turned bitter,
as the nationalisation of Rhinomian industries angered
many prominent members of its government and cartels.
A low level trade war is currently in effect, though
Regency laws and police forces limit this controversy
to the official press and intensified commercial
competition. Some willful sabotage has occured,
usually carried out by private citizens not directly
linked to either government, and in most cases acting
upon their own perogative.
