Erisis' oceans and continents are split apart by
faulting into an uneven mosaic of block-shaped
batholiths. Flat ground is nearly non-existent, and
most land is little more than pillars of rock jutting
out of the sea. While this prevents much land life,
the plethora of sheltered coves and bays creates
conditions for enormous sea diversity. The base of the
local pyramid are grass like sea plants that often
grown in dense rows or patches, within which sea life
finds shelter and food. Some of these Sea Carpets have
been adapted for agriculture and form the basis of the
local economy. The "crops" are tended by specially
equipped hovercraft, and are harvested by barges
equipped with cutters and cranes. Most Sea Carpet is
used as fertilizer, livestock feed, or as bulk and
filler in food processing. Some variants are being
tested with the assistance of commercial groups on
Vincennes to test for use as genetically engineered
"factory" crops that produce industrial chemicals
naturally.
