Torm and its "Tinytown" (starport known for its false
facade architecture) were a familiar sight to
Abandonment refugees being moved from trailing Deneb
into the Regency Safe. The port and startown are built
well away from the nearest major settlement on a large
plateau near the North Pole. Large transit camps were
constructed on this plateau, taking advantage of
abundant water supplies and cooler temperatures.
Torm's population lives in nine small settlements
scattered across the world, which are the trade and
communication hubs for mines and ranches that radiate
out from them. The population is often disparaged as a
"damn bunch of shopkeepers and schoolmarms" for their
affectation parochial attitudes and cutthroat trading
tactics. The world is a minor exporter of foodstuffs
and light industrial goods, usually cornering a
critical market to reap higher profits, a practice
that is the source of most irritation towards this
world.
