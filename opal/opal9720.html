Topas is a cold, barren rock of little intrinsic
value. But its settlement reflects the astrographic
destiny of the Islands:</B> beggars cannot be choosers. In
the old sublight days a world was a world no matter
what its physical characteristics.  Mostly Germanic in
culture, the original population settled the world
with unusual organisation and stoicism.  Unable to
core out the asteroid sized world, the colonists
instead constructed a kaninchengehege ("rabbits lair")
of winding tunnels, vaults and underground lairs for
habitation.
<P>
Mindful of the lack of water and breathable air, a
strict bureaucractic government was imposed to manage
and maintain the hydroponics and air plants located in
the rocky core of the world. Education is highly
regimented, and once a person begins a career, they
are expected to work in it for the rest of their
lives. Success brings appropriate shelter and status,
failure results in near starvation toiling as a lowly
hydroponics laborer.  This "you work, you eat" ethic
has created a very tough minded and determined people
who evince no fear in the face of adversity.  But it
did not create as much political unity as it should
have, and in the antebellum period the government and
population was divided into two factions, one
Pro-Serendip and the other Pro-Neubayern, who wished
for offworld intervention as a means of improving
local living standards.  This division led to a coup
by the Pro-Serendip faction that sparked the long
nightmare of the Islands War, a travail that hasn't
ended for Topas.
<P>
Currently large parts of the kaninchengehege are still
under the de facto control of armed insurgents and
offworld soldiers loyal to either Serendip or
Neubayern.  The original planetary administration has
been ground into dust between these two millstones,
and effective control has passed into an RQS caretaker
administration appointed from Tobia.  Like their
ancestors, both factions are tough minded and
determined, and are unwilling to accept compromise.
Reconciliation has been further complicated by
extremists on Neubayern and Serendip intent upon
sabotaging the Four-Power Talks, and reigniting the
Islands War.
