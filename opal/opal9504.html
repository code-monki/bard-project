<P>
Quhaiathat was a snowball world colonised to exploit
its rich mineral deposits. Despite its poverty of air
and water, it possessed massive subterranean deposits
of Platinum group metals, a great deal of Gold, and
huge Iron deposits. Colonisation began in the period
after the Second Frontier War, one of the few of the
Sisters' worlds that actually benefited from the
slowdown of Imperial investment and expansion.
<P>
Located far from its primary, the world is bitterly
cold. Surface temperatures approach -200 K, and most
settlements are located within former mine shafts.
Most of the worlds power supply, and therefore life
support margins, are given over to the mines and their
vital treasures.  As a result, the use of air and
water by the rest of the community had to be strictly
monitered to prevent waste.  The original technocratic
government became an impersonal bureaucracy known as
the Core, and its edicts are enforced by the
Containment Service, the world's "air police."
<P>
Rationing of air and water is strictly enforced. And
inhabitants put up with constant surveillance by the
Containment Service, monitored for excessive usage of
air and water.  Everyone is taxed according to the
amount of water and air that they use. That tax is
payed for with either money, or by additional
compulsory labor in the mines. Wasters of water and
air, and tax cheats, are usually confined to the
mines, in squalid conditions, until they pay off their
"debt."  And this penalty is applied to everyone,
regardless of stature or standing, including Core
bureaucrats. Needless to say, few people even attempt
to cheat the taxman.
<P>
In the past, Visitors were confined to the worlds
starport, or were only allowed visas with short time
expirations. Immigration was limited to a few thousand
people per year.  Despite these harsh laws, the output
of the worlds mines were rich enough to give the
common people a high standard of living, undermining
dissent. The Representational Reforms eliminated the
world governments efforts at limiting offworld contact
and immigration, but was able to compensate through
careful recruitment of offworld professionals, and a
program of technological upgrade.
<P>
Quhaiathat also has the opprobium for the highest
industrial accident rate for any world of its tech
level and nature. Since wealth is measured by the
amount of water and air that the locals can afford,
many are driven to overwork in an effort to escape the
draconian regulatory oversight. Oddly for a world of
its legal imprimatur, few regulations exist in
restraining or deterring such suicidal behavior.
Perhaps the payoff of obsessive voluntary productivity
is too great to supress. No matter what the reason,
the population has a swaggering nature reminiscent of
any dangerous occupation, only to an extreme degree.
<P>
Luck is as important as work ethic, and the society
seems to thrive on thrill seeking to some degree. A
play hard and why worry attitude is cultivated among
the young. Miners who've surivived past ten years of
such behavior are looked upon with a perverse mixture
of respect and dread. Sports are extremely popular, as
is just plain stupid daredevil behavior. RQS and Naval
personnel dread visiting the world, as the locals are
sometimes given to playing chicken or hide and seek
with local patrols.
