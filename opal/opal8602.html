Atab is a blazingly hot little ball of rock. But it
possesses large deposits of rare earths and
radioactives. A number of Imperial mining companies
set up stakes here in the 400s to mine and process the
ore for offworld export. Most of its exports are
shipped to nearby Pikha for final processing, and it
has a close trading relationship with that world.
Today the Atab is a major source world for several
elements, and is on the verge of becoming and
industrial world in its own right.
<P>
The severe onplanet shortage of water compelled these
competing firms to contract other companies to export
ice from offworld for their workers and factories, and
this arrangement eventually became the basis for a
unified government. The local bureaucracy is a
collection of water, power and environmental agencies
with a tight grip on daily life. The less advanced
habitat technology available locally is not as
efficient at containing vital life support factors
like water and moist air, and the government enforces
compensatory regulations. Civilian movement on the
surface is heavily restricted, and an extensive system
of underground vehicle and rail tunnels link the
various communities together. Life on the surface is
limited to special communities, including a sizeable
population of Jonkereen.
 <P>
Because of water shortages, all water consumption and
usage is strictly rationed by the government. For the
most part water is used for drinking and industry.
Until this century even sewage had to be disposed
without the conveyance of modern sewers, creating huge
sanitation problems. To make matters even worse,
bathing is restricted to communal baths, where the
same water can be used over again by a population. All
wastewater is recycled, and all communities have large
traps that hold this water before chemical or natural
processing can remove sewage, garbage and other
contaminants. The world's water resources are stored
in large underground cisterns, dug out with lasers and
fusion charges. Lined with impermeable clay, and kept
cool to prevent evaporation, the cisterns can store a
stationary pool for several hundred years without
leaking or contamination. An extensive network of
canals and pipes distribute water to the population.
For economic reasons, cooling technology like air
conditioning are restricted to cooling these cisterns,
and the population gets by on shade and other less
power intensive technologies.
