Pagamin never really attracted that much attention over the years. Although Pagamin is the closest world to its sun, Quinzica, it
orbits 0.4 AU�s out, which is outside of the habitable zone. However, the average temperature of �10.4C is not bad as far as cold
worlds go. The world is dry, only 11% of the world�s surface is covered by water. The atmospheric taint rating is due to infrequent
dust storms, which can make the air unbreathable, without filtration, for days. The combination of the cold, the dryness, and the
silicate dust storms kept people away.
 <P>
Pagamin lay unsettled until 1068. That was when a Delgado Trading mining operation was established on the world. What caught
their attention was the Second Survey report on the world. It stated that large concentrations of Gallium Arsenide were present.
Gallium compounds make excellent semiconductors and have been extensively used in rectifiers, transistors, photoconductors,
and laser and maser diodes. Gallium is also used in neutrino detectors.
 <P>
The operation wasn�t large. About fifty employees were required to oversee the automated mining equipment and refining
process. Production continued until the Abandonment. At this point, Delgado Trading shut down the facility and evacuated its
personnel. D.T. mothballed the facilities in hopes of one day returning to Pagamin to resume mining.
 <P>
Pagamin lay dormant once again until 1161 when Vargr from the Gvaekurs group on Mazirbe moved in. Looking to establish a
Wildside base close to Mazirbe for their smuggling operation, the Gvaekurs had little choice but to pick Pagamin. Dunmag and
Niven were inhospitable. Nibel, Haggard, and Bangwe were crawling with RQS and RISS agents. Sneaking past RISS and RQS
personnel on Mazirbe was difficult enough. Besides, the Gallium mines made for excellent hiding places.
 <P>
Upon hearing about the Vargr presence on the world, Delgado Trading protested. Fearing that Pagamin would one day become
another fait accompli world, they demanded that the Regency force the Vargr off the world. The Regency complied somewhat by
routinely sending RQS patrols to Pagamin to pay the Vargr a visit. All checks for contraband have come up empty. With no
evidence of any wrongdoing and not seeing the Vargr presence on the world as much of a threat, there are only two dozen or so
Vargr on the world after all, the Regency has not brought down the proverbial hammer. However, the RQS does continue to keep
watch.
 <P>
With the announcement of the opening of the Frontier, Delgado Trading has vowed to reclaim Pagamin, but time has tempered
them somewhat. D.T. has stated that they will be willing to negotiate with the Vargr on Pagamin, but they will not settle for
anything that does not allow them to renew their mining operations.
