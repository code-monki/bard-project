Tullyhome is covered by a fog shrouded ocean, dotted
by small mountainous islands. The population is
divided by geography into numerous petty states, along
lines of race, ethnicity, belief, clan and family.
Feuds between different factions are common and
ongoing, and territories are zealously guarded by
local militias. Because of the world's frigid
temperatures, most conflicts are over the rich fishing
grounds and aqualcultural beds, and fighting is
accomplished between experienced wet naval marines.
Grav vehicles are rare, and the population gets around
in locally built powerboats and catamarans, and are
very skilled seamen and navigators.
