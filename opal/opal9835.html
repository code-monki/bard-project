Sarage was deliberately settled by the Third Imperium
in the late 700s as a contact colony with the remote
Droyne world of Auitawry.  Most of the population was
either scientists studying the Droyne or traders and
support personnel. Because of the sensitive nature of
this world, the Imperium provided it with its own
defense forces, and created institutions that made the
world virtually self governing. Since the Collapse the
population has swelled with Quarantine and naval
personnel, and several hundred thousand of their
dependents, for Sarage's military base is the main
housing center for the 231st. Several large monitors
patrol the system, and several naval battles have
occured near local refueling sources in the past.
