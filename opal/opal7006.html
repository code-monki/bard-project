Alexandria (1216) was used to train Confederation Marines in all aspects of 
Ground Combat. The Naval Base supported this, and was more like a commercial
starport in some respects, dealing with the off loading of Cargo and 
Troops. <P>

During the Second Rim War it gained an additional role. It supported the 
'Ghost Fleet', a collection of heavily up-gunned Imperial Merchant 
Vessels.  These would join self protection convoys in imperial space, identify the  best targets, and capture them, destroying those ships not worth  bothering about.<P>

The planet's computer suicided in the collapse, and the Naval Base was 
reactivated in 1156 to support recovery operations into the Coreward half 
of  the Subsector, and to patrol the Zanzumah - Karden spur of the Main. The 
planet has provided Beltan with top rate ground weaponry, from Grav Tanks to
Powered Armour. The Planetary Governor allowed the covert operation of 
Beltanian Merchant vessels into the Coreward and Antispinward reaches of the
Sector during the lean years when the Empire restricted trade to within
it's boundaries. Now it is a major hub for the relic trade. Most of the 
population either works in the Naval Base or on recovery missions on the 
planet.<P>

Fleet assets at Alexandria include the Q-Ship <I>Covert Seeker</I> , two <I>Crusader </I> 
Class Destroyers, and five patrol cruisers. The remnants of the Q-ships 
also stationed there include a Bulk Freighter, two Frontier Traders, and 
four <I>Phantom</I>  Class Far Traders. A sizeable <I>Ramrod</I> SDB squadron also 
defends the system. <P>
