The world is a biological desert, with few
multicellular lifeforms present. Much of the world
consists of desert covered in lava formations and
eroded volcanic sand. Geysers and hot springs are
common, and periodic eruptions from cinder cones and
volcanoes foul the air with heavy metal oxides and
poisonous sulfur compounds. But this same volcanic
activity ensured a heavy accumulation of metal ores
useful for interstellar commerce. The poisonous
conditions preempted permanent colonisation, and most
early visitors were transient belters seeking rich
finds. Poaching by illegal miners led to the world
being interdicted in 483 as an Imperial resource
world.
<P>
The first colonists were prisoners sent during the
Second Frontier War to mine the ore for the war
effort. As the world's mineral wealth enriched local
subsector authorities and nobles, concern for the
miners suddenly began to slip. More and more penal
colonists were brought in to work the mines, until
their demographic weight ensured that they would
procreate children in sufficient numbers to staff the
mines on a long term basis. As these children were
brought up ignorant of a life beyond their world, it
became easy for their masters to institute even more
cunningly repressive measures to ensure their
obeisance.
<P>
The Ward of Vision and his cult first appeared in the
mid-800s, backed fully by the Imperial Aristocracy. No
evidence exists that it was deliberate policy among
these nobles to back such a foul and despicable
policy; rather the Ward and his closest supporters had
enough money and patience to buy support, and silence
critics, and convince the mainstream society that
their culture was a product of unique religious
experience, and not the soulless tyranny it was. A
Solomani leader put it aptly:</B> "Evil unchecked grows,
evil tolerated taints the whole system." It wasn't the
times running on time that compelled the Imperium to
support the Ward, whose little empire was never that
efficient, but rather an effete and luxury loving
aristocracy pathologically worried more about the
mortgage on their mansions than the welfare of their
subjects.
<P>
The war of liberation that overthrew the Ward and his
corrupt government was the result of a drastic
intervention on the part of the Regency government.
Regency Election Observers (REOs) trained by members
of the Regency Army Special Forces were dropped or
infiltrated onto the planet in the middle 1150s, and
intermingled with the lower classes. There they began
to preach and teach a liberation theology that
questioned the legitimacy of the Ward's rule. In
actuality Endup's population were less inspired
religious aspects of their message, than by their
message of secular freedom and sophont rights.
Revolutionary cells sprang up on the world in most
communities, and by the early 1170s conditions were
ripe for revolution. Because the Regency refused (and
still refuses) to avow responsibility for its agents
on the world, the Ward of Vision and his troops were
effectively isolated in their efforts, and powerless
to stop the spread of the infection. In 1174 the
bloody outcome of a confrontation between the regime's
mercenary soldiers and rioting civilians sparked a
general uprising. The Ward and his officials initially
retreated into their high altitude fortresses, relying
upon their superior firepower to decimate rebel
attacks. But atrocities committed by the Ward's troops
gave the Regent the pretext to impose a blockade on
vital military supplies to the system, and the rebels
slowly gained the upper hand against the now isolated
garrisons. In 1177 the Ward of Vision surrendered his
last stronghold, and fled the world for exile on Mora.
<P>
The current government on Lucifer is a civil service
bureaucracy staffed in large part by former underlings
of the ancien regime that either sided with the
revolution, or offworlders with the skills and
experience that the population lacked. With local
businesses and civic institutions still relatively new
and untried, the central government still provides
most local administration and services. To rectify the
lack of skills and contacts among the populace, and to
turn back centuries of still lingering xenophobia, the
government sponsors relief and recovery operations
that send local volunteers to work on other poor
worlds across the Regency. Exposure to other planetary
cultures has been a boon to local education and
business development, and at the same time has
established the world as a benchmark for other
democratic reformers on worlds still suffering from
dictatorship.
<P>
The world's atmosphere is home to a number of deadly
toxins, byproducts of ancient volcanism. Under the
previous regime, repeat exposure drastically limited
the lifespans of the populace, and created high infant
and child mortality rates. Because of the low regard
in which they were held, the population developed a
fatalistic attitude about themselves, regarding death
as an acceptable outlet from a life of ongoing misery.
Since the airtight homes have been built for the
masses, allowing for filtered air and water. Good
health is considered to be a human right on Lucifer,
and universal health care is provided for all,
regardless of wealth or status.
