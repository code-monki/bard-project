Ucella was a lush and inviting world when it was first
surveyed by Ingaz Ruffleran in the first century.
Aside from high temperatures and limited water
resources, the world boasted a long growing season and
rich, fertile soil. The first colonists came here in
the late 400s to work the land, mostly as herders, and
then as grain farmers. Despite its richness, the loss
of Imperial interest in the subsector in the wake of
the first couple of Frontier Wars and the Psionic
Supressions limited its economic progress. Left
outside of Imperial borders, its agricultural products
became rather unimportant economically to its
neighbors, and the world went into a protracted
economic decline in the mid 800s.
 <P>
Ling Standard Products approached the planetary
government in the early 900s, proposing to build a
number of "enriching industrial projects" that would
elevate the population from poverty, and put it in the
Imperial mainstream once again.  Pitching a deal that
was too good to be true, Ucella's government
essentially capitulated to the company's implicit
demands, eliminating oversight for the proposed
development, and giving LSP an indefinite lease.
 <P>
Having tied the world to a gurney, Ling Standard
Products proceeded to construct several chemical
plants.  Their pollution immediately tainted the
atmosphere, poisoned the local Chirper population, and
slowly wrecked the world's ecosystem.  Agricultural
output fell, further impoverishing the population. And
using a loophole in the world's immigration laws, and
reneging on their promise to employ the world's
population, the company imported tens of thousands of
workers from their offworld facilities to run the
plant. In addition, tens of thousands of additional
support personnel came with them, creating a
segregated company town isolated from native Ucellans.
 <P>
LSP ran the plants in a high-handed and reckless
manner, resulting in numerous accidents, and indulging
in shady and illegal behavior. Contraband was
manufactured alongside propellants, solvents and
compounds needed by the Imperial military. The
company's private shuttleports became "Tortugas" for
smugglers and racketeers. Managers and employees were
encouraged by their dominance to flagrantly disregard
local laws.
 <P>
Protests to the Duke of Iderati went unheeded, and the
company imported a large merc contingent to protect
the facilities.  Matters came to a head after the
Collapse, when the Regency government stripped LSP of
its  business licenses in 1132 as part of a crackdown
on corporate chicanery. An MoJ investigation into its
local operations led to the plants being seized, and
criminal indictments against company managers for
conspiracy, racketeering, smuggling and the
manufacture of contraband.  LSP withdrew completely
from the world in lieu of regaining its licenses
again, and a slow recovery is still under way.  The
local Chirper population has begun to recover, and are
the focus of the new Droyne uplift program run under
RISS supervision.
 <P>
The massive reduction in population is a reflection of
the withdrawal of the sprawling LSP compound and its
personnel, rather than any kind of major catastrophe.
The environment has undergone enough of natural
recycling that agricultural production is beginning to
reapproach its old levels. While still poor, and still
outside the Regency border, trade coming from the
Hinters has created a viable source of secondary
income, and the world has had an amicable relationship
with the Regency as a client state.  RQS teams even
volunteer to help the locals in their clean up
efforts.
 <P>
Most of the plants were unsalvageable for recycling or
conversion, and it took a concerted fifteen year
cleanup by MoI, paid in large part by fines extracted
from LSP, to just make the countryside around them
livable for the locals.  Many plant and dump sites are
beyond reclamation. Most have simply been stripped of
their contaminated soil and water, and the waste
shipped offworld for incineration. Many others still
await cleanup, and the Amber Zone reflects the
dangerous nature of these sites.
