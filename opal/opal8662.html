Furens is the tragic resting place for the ships and
men lost from Task Force Arkan against the Kishkii and
her vampire fleet. The largest gas giant is a war
memorial to that infamous battle, and is posted as a
gravesite against salvage and desecration. Because
Furens itself was used as a refuelling site by the
Kishkii for her fatal run against Trin, the Regency
government poured billions of credits into the world's
infrastructure, helping build up its defenses and
affording a squadron of TL-12 SDBs and monitors.
<P>
Without these subsidies Furens is a poor mining world.
The world is very young, and most of the population
works deep mining sites around midocean ridges. In
many ways the population would rather be left alone by
the greater interstellar society, but military
necessities has overriden the local desire for
privacy. The downport is constructed from surplus
military warship hulls modified for additional
buoyancy, and several of these hulls still mount some
armaments, principally lasers and missles.
