The Ancient site on Tetzel is one of the best
preserved and most extensive in the entire former
Imperium. Because this site was discovered by
civilians attached with the old Ministry of
Colonisation, and because of its size, no attempt
could be made to keep the find secret. Instead the
Imperial government made the world a Naval Reserve in
604, and declared most of it offlimits to civilians.
<P>
At least four main sites have been discovered, plus a
dozen smaller auxiliary sites, around the breadth of
the system. From the debris that has been collected
Regency scholars have deduced that the site was a
major manufacturing world. Tantalising remnants of
Ancient starships have been found in what appears to
have been a large surface starport that once covered
four hundred square miles of the surface. At other
sites were found advanced robots that worked at a
diversity of different tasks, from mining to
manufacturing.  Surveys indicate that the local
facilities were attacked on four seperate occasions.
After the third attack several smaller sites were
abandoned by their inhabitants, and dating has shown
that these were destroyed in a final attack about five
thousand years AFTER the accepted end of the Final
War, an incongruity that remains unexplained by
current scholarship.<P>

Some ninety percent of the world is offlimits to
unauthorised personnel, and this prohibition is
reinforced by several squadrons of 154th Fleet units
based in orbit. Visitors are confined to the Downport
and the surrounding community of Tetzeltown. Most
visitors are accredited arcaeologists, physical
scientists and engineers attached to prestigious
research institutions or working for the Regency
government. Several universities maintain "garages",
small contract research labs that work under contract
to the Ministry of the Navy and/or Interior and
Science. Tourists have to be content with visiting the
extensive musuem that includes a full-scale mockup of
what the Ancient facilities are thought to have looked
like.
<P>
Despite hundreds of years of research, however,
deciphering of Ancient secrets has been painfully
slow. Most of the research has concentrated on the
destroyed downport, largely because of its military
applications. There has been more progress since the
declassification of other Ancient sites around the
Regency, as research carried out at these sites has
been synergistic in some cases with local work.
