Lan-chou was settled around 388, and its population
grew in response for demand in foodstuffs on nearby
Giikusu. The world lost a significant amount of its
population to the Abandonment, and local industry and
agriculture have had to realign to compensate.
Previously its primary products were meat and hides
from its extensive ranches, which cultivated a local
animal known as the Shlurry, a cow sized animal that
vaguely resembles the Terran potato bug. But the
ranching industry was hurt by flagging demand and
depopulation, and more and more ranchers have
abandoned the export business altogether. Most have
gone into light industry and energy "farming", the
latter being mostly solar and wind generators utilised
to power factories that manufacture components and
Pre-stellar technology for local use or export to
nearby Giikusu. The local government has plans to
modernise the world now that the Frontier has been
lifted, and is eagerly seeking new immigrants on
overcrowded worlds like Lilad or Deneb.
