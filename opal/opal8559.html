Formerly known as Dofil. The world was first colonised
by the Vargr during the Rule of Man period, and has
remained unchallenged for its entire history. Enormous
volcanic pressure is built into the planets dense
mantle, which is relieved by extreme volcanic activity
at several junctures of the planets surface. Most of
the population lives in semi-mobile communities
designed for easy dismantlement and relocation in the
event that a volcanic eruption makes a current
location untenable to live in. In antebellum times the
world government was a bureaucratic outgrowth of
academic groups that tracked seismic and volcanic
activity, placing the population and its movements
under their control. A Vampire Fleet slagged the
plnetary capitol with a nuclear airburst in 1145, and
the population has fragmented into feuding nations.
The most powerful of these is a TED that has control
of the former governments main armory and munitions
plant; though the facility can no longer mass produce
TL-5 materials, enough are stockpiled to give "king"
Athuengun the power to bully his neighbors into
tribute. Athuengun is opposed by another TED named
Gaergh the Greedy, who has an alliance with a Vampire
Fleet dating back over thirty years. To the common
people, Gaergh is preferrable to Athuengun, but the
former is subject to the whims of his allies, who only
resupply his forces at sporadic intervals.
