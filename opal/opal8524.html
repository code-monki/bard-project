Formerly known as Retion. The world was a marginal, if
comfortable, agricultural world that attracted a
variety of back-to-nature groups in years following
the Third Frontier War. Industrial development was
conspiciously avoided, and trade with both Imperial
neighbors and nearby Vargr worlds was heavily
encouraged. The warmth of relations with the latter
lulled local leaders into a false sense of security,
and the world had no defenses against Vargr corsairs
that took the world in 1119. Scorched earth tactics
used by several corsair groups to root out possible
guerillas destroyed the world's economy, and thousands
of locals fled for safer worlds in the Domain. The
world was seized by line forces of the Assemblage of
1116 in 1128, and the world was ceded to them under
the 1132 final adjustments. Gnaghdze is really just a
large refugee camp, as most of its inhabitants are
unfortunates that have straggled in from the former
Vargr Extents, and who lack the money or connections
to get them further into the Regency.
