Formerly known as Filangger. Because of its location
near the Vargr Extents this world was only lightly
settled by Imperial culture humans. The colonists that
did settle here made more money by trade of foodstuffs
and mined ore to the Vargr than to neighboring human
colonies. Amicable relations developed with nearby
Vargr worlds, and the usual Humaniti-Vargr conflicts
were practically unknown here. Because of these
peaceful relations, it never became a full member of
the Imperium, and when the Civil War it was
contracting its defense out to mercenaries paid for in
part by the Imperial government.
<P>
Things quickly changed as a result of Strephons'
assassination. Lulled into a false sense of security,
the world was poorly prepared to fight the wolves
congregating across the border in Tuglikki sector.
Forces from the Assemblage of 1116 conquered the world
on 321-1116, as both the mercs and the locals failed
to put up any kind of serious resistance to the
invaders. The Assemblage cleansed a large portion of
the population during the first three years of the
occupation, and Vargr colonists replaced the fleeing
and expelled humans.
<P>
Denebian retaliatory raids were especially vengeful,
and human guerillas fought against the new government
with offworld aid. The severity of these attacks
convinced the Assemblage leadership to relocate its
forces elsewhere, and the raids began to drop in
intensity after 1125 as the strategic picture began to
change. Ironically, punishing attacks against the
world's infrastructure saved it from Virus. The
destruction of power plants and communication nodes
had created a patchwork of isolated internal networks
not connected to the original prewar grids. Virus
annihilated the world's highport and satellite system,
but failed to do much damage to surface settlements no
longer connected to centralised systems.
<P>
Most of the surface communities had been developing
towards self sufficiency at TL 9-10, and quickly
shrugged off the damage that was inflicted. The world
did balkanise into about twenty smaller states,
centered around each "patch" of surviving or salvaged
infrastructure. Most of the population now lives in a
mixture of island settlements, or floating habitats.
The old human population is now heavily outnumbered by
the descendants of Vargr refugees. The listed starport
is controlled by the Llaegaerz League, which has been
using its commercial dominance to slowly bring the
world under its control. The League has managed to
salvage about eight or nine starships, which it uses
to trade with nearby worlds and on occasion with the
Regency. The League's dominance of the world is
opposed by the Khankael Empire, a large trading state
that controls its own ramshackle fleet, and hopes to
unify the world under its own banner as the first step
to the creation of a new interstellar state.
