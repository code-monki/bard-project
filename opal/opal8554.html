Ivora had been a pleasant world before the Collapse.
Despite heavy sulfur levels due to active volcanism,
its massive ocean was a rich source of nutrients. The
locals cultivated fish and various kinds of sea plants
for offworld export. Nearly all of the population
lived on the Vyborg Archipelago, a large island chain
in the northern temperate belt, whose geography
sheltered a massive fishing bed known as the Finland
Bank (so called for its resemblance to an ancient
country on Terra). The world was ceded by the Domain
of Deneb after the Vargr invasion into nearby Corridor
cut the region off from the Third Imperium, and many
local groups became affiliated with Human and Vargr
pirates operating in the small buffer region between
the DoD and the Dzarrgh Federate. After the Collapse,
this association with marauders was continued by
several local warlords. The most powerful of these,
King Hagar of Yagestan, has made several alliances
with various free trader collectives and more than one
Vampire Fleet. Because of Ivora's low tech level,
Hagar's chief negotiating tool has been the provision
of shelter to various shipcrews in the coves and bays
of his island kingdom, and providing foodstuffs and
intelligence to free trader and Vampire Ship crews. He
is by no means a benevolent fellow, despite his
diplomatic savvy:</B> his forces have recieved higher TL
armaments in trade with these offworld powers, and
uses them to extract heavy taxation from the other
communities on the world. Most of these taxes go to
the Vampires, minus a fifteen percent "excise" that
goes to Hagar and his troops.
