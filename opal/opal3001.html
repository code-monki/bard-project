 Bwan Murr has no working spacecraft but does have a working albiet primitive
planetary defense system, which consists of planetary radar sites and
ballistic missles.  The government is a run by the Reverend Desmond
who preaches that the stars are populated by devils and offworlders are their
servants.  The government treats its populace pretty well, it just attempts
to kill strangers on sight.<P>
