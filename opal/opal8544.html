Donu-na was originally settled by Solomani Imperials
around 330. These were nobles from Capitol, who
divided the massive deserts into vast estates.
Originally these were intended to be safe havens in
the event of insurrection or exile, a purpose that was
eventually put to use in the aftermath of the
Alkhaliikoi ascension. Under the leadership of the
self styled "Sultan" of Donu-na, the local oligarchy
began to import industrial base and workers around 750
to make a profit. Under the loose rule of the Sultan,
local society was unusally permissive, in the sense
that he or she rarely attempted to impose common law
upon the other members of the elite. The antebellum
tech level is actually reflective of the laissez faire
policies of the Sultan in regards to the other
landlords, and does not reflect the conditions on
individual holdings.
<P>
And many lords were quite oppressive, with their
workers subject to poor living conditions and brutal
repression of their basic rights. Public discontent
often boiled over into bloody revolts. Nearly all of
these revolts were unsuccessful, and survivors often
fled to "safety" towns near the starport or in remote
regions of the desert. The largest of these towns was
Byalistok, which is now the biggest city on Donu-na in
terms of population. Eventually these towns were
annexed by nearby lords, but their greater freedom and
insistence upon civil society attracted even more
offworld immigration and investment, and eventually
began to outcompete the rural industries of the
oligarchs.
<P>
By the Civil War period local industry was primarily
manufacturing TL 9-11 components for export to other
technologically depressed regions of the Domain of
Deneb. Working conditions varied, though, with
conditions in the cities being much better than in the
countryside. The Sultan and his allies were fairly
confident that they could bottle up dissent in the
cities despite the economic depression the world was
suffering, and prevent a wider conflagration in the
countryside. The Sultan did not account for Vargr
raiding, or the Post-Collapse immigration of refugees.
As Vargr corsairs and marauders took advantage of the
space between the different estates and cities, local
self defense brigades were formed by the local
population, and these steadily undercut the now
ineffective oligarchs. A near economic collapse in the
late 1130s was the final blow to the rickety power
structure, and the world has been collapsing into
balkanisation ever since. The city-states have led the
process, by declaring independence, and fortifying
their holdings against outside "aggression".
<P>
The situation on Donu-na has been one of progressive
decay, though it has slowed in the last twenty years.
The old technocracy has completely disintegrated as
rural workers and officials have fled the anarchy and
poverty in the countryside for the safety towns. Most
oligarchs have simply vanished into the crowds of
refugees or have fled offworld. Crosscountry travel is
not recommended, though the world's cities are orderly
enough to prevent a full amber listing. In areas where
the locals haven't fled economic privation, human and
vargr brigands are often in control, and harass and
raid every outsider they encounter.
