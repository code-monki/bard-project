Weepo was originally settled for its agricultural
output, especially its fine wines and whiskys.  The
world is slightly cooler than Terra, with milder
seasons and virtually all of its land in the temperate
latitudes. Most of the population became scattered
between small farmholds, linked only by a service
network of buyers and suppliers that catered to their
needs, and collected their harvests for sale and
distribution offworld.
<P>
But Weepo has become more reknowned for its power as a
trade center. Because of its location, the world is a
vast entrepot.  For centuries, all interstellar trade
moving across Piah subsector had to pass through this
system for customs and processing before it could
proceed into the Avalar Consulate. The Consulate
maintained a huge naval base for the processing and
regulation of non-Avalar merchants, particularly those
coming from Imperial space. Long before the
Quarantine, the Consulate has maintained only minimal
outside contact at just a handful of interface worlds,
and forbidding any other contact under threat of
lengthy imprisonment and confiscation of ship and
property. Besides Weepo, the only other main interface
point facing the Imperium was at Ryanbiwul (2527).
<P>
The Collapse has reinforced this practice, giving the
Consulate the full authority it lacked in the past.
But in reality the volume of trade, and the prosperity
it brings, has actually weakened the Consulates
control of its borders. While most traders do go
through these interface ports, a significant minority
simply ignores quarantine regulations, and jump the
border at will. Most of these ships enter through the
porous borders of the former Kamrati League, and most
have either bribed the local quarantine patrols, or
are doing "unofficial shipments" for various interests
in the Avalar government and Venue.
<P>
All traffic entering Weepo system is under stricter
control. All ships are required to adhere to a group
of narrow loitering approaches, seperated for incoming
and outgoing ships, and for Consulate bound and
departing traffic. The failure to adhere to these
regulations will result in pretty much the same
penalties that Regency merchants are familiar with.
And Avalar naval patrols are in heavy evidence. Ships
may only deviate from these approach paths if they
have proof that they have a reason, or business to
attend to. Of Weepo's five gas giants, only two of
them are open to refueling, the other three are
heavily mined and patrolled.
<P>
Despite this show of vigilance, experienced travellers
will discover rampant corruption among the local
custom and quarantine crews. Many longtime traders
have "bankers" among the local officialdom, people
that they pay bribes or protection money in exchange
for relaxed scrutiny of their cargos. Petty bribery
touches every section of the local hiearchy, from
naval captains to the lowest dockhands, and it takes
some learning before determining WHO it counts to
bribe; otherwise expect to be shaken down by every
nonentity in customs. Despite this petty corruption,
the local officials will not allow traders to get away
with murder. Contraband is tolerated to a point, but
major crimes will be prosecuted regardless of how
large a bribe a miscreant pays. (The bribes paid in
such situations are called "wishing well money" by the
locals.)
<P>
Weepo itself is a major marketing center for goods
collected elsewhere on the Coil. Most independent
traders do not have the resources or time for
relicensing at the Weepo interface, and many sell
their cargos to speculators and auctioneers who hawk
these wares in open-air brokerage "pits" in the
downport and at regular intervals in the capitol city.
In addition, a number of "pimps", mercenary and
underworld recruiters, that roam the streets looking
for skilled persons who are looking to make a few
extra credits in the no-man's land between of Piah,
Urnian and Reidain subsectors.  Some of these
recruiters, one should be warned, are very dishonest,
and include assassins and slavers.
