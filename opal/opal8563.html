Gabrael is a hot, windy world carved by into deep
chasms and canyons by erosion and seismic activity.
The local plant pollens are microscopic in size with
high amounts of silica in composition, and are
extremely irritating to the mucus and breathing
membranes of offworld life. In spite of the challenges
of living here, its strategic location in the middle
of the Millions Bisector, as the local J-1 route is
known, made it an important trade center and meeting
ground. Naasirka invested heavily into its
infrastructure and industry, and it became a major
manufacturer of electronics, robotic components and
software for sale in Deneb Sector, or for export into
nearby Vargr space.
<P>
Because of the trade it generated, Vargr began
immigrating here in large numbers. Most of these were
highly skilled technical workers who complemented the
local human population very nicely. The good will
generated between the two communities was genuine, and
the world became famous in antebellum times for the
high level of integration that developed between local
Humanity and Vargr. The Vargr population became very
Pro-Imperial, and became a source of soldiers and
spacers that willingly volunteered to serve against
the Corsairs that ravaged the region.
<P>
The Abandonment could not destroy this unity. A
sizeable minority of the population did evacuate, but
the majority either had too many personal or economic
incentives, and were loath to abandon the hard-won
accomplishments of their mixed-race community. Most of
the world's automated industrial base was dismantled
or destroyed in anticipation of Virus, and a shift to
agriculture and self-sustaining industry was achieved
with Regency assistance. The old represenative
government has been supplanted by a council of
Vargr-style charismatic strongmen elected on the basis
of their effectiveness and leadership. A couple of
Million's free trader collectives draw their personnel
from Gabrael, and despite a lack of starport
facilities, the world has extensive (for the Wilds)
trade with neighboring worlds, particularly nearby Wyn
(Deneb 2908). Wyn's starport isn't capable of
maintaining Gabrael's starships, and vessels must
journey to Gnaedzrrang (Deneb 3004) for maintenance.
Because that world does not have sufficient tech
level, Gabraelian crews salvage needed spare parts
from the old naval base at Taproban (Deneb 3008), and
buy access to the yards with useful salvage.
Gabraelian merchants and skilled workers are present
on several nearby worlds in the Bisector, and
constitute most of Million's middle class.
