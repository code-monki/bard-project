Oriflamme is in orbit 0 around Von Strucker: its primary which is a K8 V
star.
Its orbital period is 47.8 standard days. The orbit is fairly elliptical,
making
for severe seasonal changes.  The weather goes from blazingly hot to
freezing
cold in a matter of weeks.  Unlike most planets, due to the eccentric orbit
the
seasons are not of equal duration. The planet moves slowest while farthest
from
the star, and moves very quickly while close to the star. At apastron the
average temperature plunges to -10C. This winter season lasts for about 10
days.
While during periastron passage the average temperature climbs to 40C, but
thankfully this only lasts for approximetly 5 days. The planet has a very
low
axial tilt, so the two hemispheres experence the seasons at the same time.
The atmosphere has a high concentration of CO2.<P>

<A NAME="history"><H3>History</H3></A>

Nemyer was settled by a mixed bag of Solomani during the Rule of Man.  Many
of the colonists were of Russian or German nationality. After the
Long Night it willingly joined the expanding Third Imperium. It was made
part of the Solomani Autonomous Zone by Empress Margaret
and during the  Rim War it fought with great gusto on the behalf of
the Solomani Confederation.  Imperial might was too much for it and it
was captured by Imperial forces in the later stages of the war.  It remained
part of the Imperium, until the Rebellion.  Like the rest of the Old
Expanses, Nemyer was annexed by the Solomani Confederation in 1118.
<P>
Since Nemyer is one of the few industrial worlds with a decent starport this
initially means a slight increase in prosperity as the Solomani buy
provisions from them.  Nemyer is pretty indifferent to who
rules them.  They have sympathies with the solomani but don't really like
SolSec and after all the Impies have been pretty good time.
<P>
Before the Rebellion the world was ruled by a Senate made up of the
members of leading families and prominent citizens.  Citizens earned the
right to join the Senate through public service, or outstanding
accomplishments in science or business.  The Senate had no fixed size and
could expand or shrink depending on the number of people worthy of
memberhip.
Membership ranged from a low of 1460 in the year 659 to a high of 2891 in
the year 1021.  During the Rebellion there approximetly 1550 members.
Members of the Senate and the other influential people of the day were
informally referred to as the Notables. Members of leading families got
in by inheriting a major business, or by having their powerful families
arrange
for them to get a sufficiently important political job.  This system
recieved
popular approval and was relatively efficeient in managing the affairs of
government.<P>

<h3>Hard Times</h3>

As the Solomani sphere of control begins to contract, Nemyer finds itself
more and more isolated and thrown upon its own resources.  This results
in economic decline and the dislocation of a lot of people.  They begin
turning to the Local Notables who have long ruled Nemyer for help.  This
comes to increasingly resemble a "patron-client" relationship.  For
instance, shopkeepers might become dependent on the  owner of a shopping
center for protection, or a distributor who continues to make deliveries
even though they have trouble paying.  Barter and exchanges of favors are
used to keep the system and the economy running.<P>

<h3>Collapse</h3>
The day the machines went mad.  Most of the Virus strains that infected
Nemyer were of the suicider type.  They caused grav transports to crash
into buildings, elevators to plummet, powerplants to blow up and destroyed
much of the high-tech infrastructure of the cities where a majority of the
population lived.  The high tech farms in Nemyer's rural areas used
large numbers of robotic farm machines.  Virus turned the machines that
once fed Nemyer's billions into bands of murderous machines that killed
anything in their path.<P>

Refugees fleeing the failing cities were easy prey for these maruading
machines.  Columns of refugees were beset by giant combines who mowed
down the people as so many rows of grass. Most of these bands of
rogue machines didn't last more than a year or so, but scattered bands
were seen as late as 1154.  The farm machines did not account for a large
percentage of the victims of the Collapse, but the psycholgical impact was
great.   Almost every rural
community that survived the Collapse had at least one run in with some
rampaging
farm machines, and the images of the machines still hold a place in the
collective memories of the Oriflammen.<P>

Many Nemyerans had lived in crowded
industrial cities and were hard hit by the Collapse, but most of them by
far survived the first weeks.  Many believe it would have been better if
they died.  The Collapse came shortly before the onset of winter.
Many died from the cold before they could have
starved to death and these numerous frozen corpses provided a food source
for gangs of cannibals.  Outlying agricultural areas sometimes faired
better, but many succumbed to hordes of refugees who ate everything and
then joined the locals in starvation.  Despite all this death there were
a phenomenal number of people on Nemyer and it took almost a decade for
the first wave of die-offs to end.  Throughout this period the Notables
 took care of their "clients" as best they
could, and adopted those people initially who they had ties with through
Hard Times but then took anyone with useful skills.  They organized
agriculture in existing or newly cleared land.  They got some machines
running again with laboriously hand wired transistor controls that had to
be rewired by hand to be reprogramed.  Without these people to rally
around, Nemyer might have collapsed all the way to the stone age.<P>

After the first year, things appeared to stabilize for a while.  But then
much of the agriculture land that had previously been heavily fertilized
began
to be used up.  There were very few fertilizers and the demand for food was
too
great to allow land to lie fallow to rejuvenate.  As food again became
scarce,
groups of raiders organized by local Notables began to raid people in
neighboring areas or to try wholesale invasions of more fertile territory.
This
lead to over a decade of endless wars and slaughter.  When this cycle had
run
its course, what it left were stable, self-reliant cantonments ruled by one
or a
small group of the most powerful Notables.  These became the Holdings.
Eventually small groups of Holdings were banded together into Trusts. These
Trusts have replaced the Holdings as the principle players on the world
scene.
Not all Holdings have been amaglemated, and the independent Holdings are a
vocal
minority in the Council of the Technarchs.<P>

This period is the origin of the militarization of Nemyer.
Technarchs developed household troops to defend their crops from the
starving masses or to seize important facilities.  Later these troops may
have been used to compete for dwindling resources with other Technarchs
after it became clear that there wasn't enough to go around and it was
kill or be killed.<P>

As Nemyer recovered, Technarchs began to focus less on being
totally self-sufficient and more on being economically competitive, and
so we see the rise of Trusts which hold little territory and may not be
at all involved in agriculture, but hold major economic or technological
assets.<P>

In 1157 the Feudal Technocracy system became formalized. The Feudal
Technocracy
system worked very well for encouraging investment and speeding Nemyers
recovery.  Immediately after the collapse it was probably TL6 or 7 but has
managed to make it all the way to 9 in a short time because of the ability
of
the Technarchs to gather large amounts of resources and focus them on a
goal.
Sometimes that goal was conquering territory to seize sources of raw
materials
or factories so Nemyer suffered from seemingly continual border wars in many
areas.<P>

In about 1188, there was some kind of constitutional convention to review
the agreements that had formalized the Feudal Technocracy system.  During
this
time, there was agitation by the "middle class" of technicians and
professionals
who resented being "owned" by a technarch.  This resulted in some changes
that
allowed people to buy out their contracts, and made becoming a "subject" of
a
technarch on a childs 18th birthday a matter of mutual choice for the new
adult
and the technarch.  This sounded great.  In practice it has meant that the
"middle class" gets paid more while the technarchs are free to shed many of
their least capable people.  These people are forming a new class of
dispossesed.  Some of them get jobs that pay a simple wage (without being a
subject) but because these were the least desirable people, many are simply
homeless.  They also tend to migrate to the Free Cities and are becoming a
serious drain on them.<P>

This has caused an interesting split among Oriflammen.  Some want to go
the rest of the way to a free market, and some want to go back to the
"Good Old Days" when everyone was taken care of and the Technarchs made
sure everyone got a decent education since they couldn't get rid of them.<P>

The guiding principle behind the government is that Nemyer is ruled by
those most capable of bringing the new technological discoveries into
production and spreading their benifits to the citizens of Oriflamme.
A citizen who swears  alliegence to a Holding on Oriflamme does so of
his own free will,  and in return he gets a promise of protection and
security from his Technarch. Liegemen of a trust are never laid off in
bad economic times. When they reach a venerable age, they are allowed to
retire and provided for. Liegmen are never cast out when they are of no
longer any use. In fact, the old ones are treated not as a burden, but as
a valuable resource, which can pass on their wisdom to the next
generation.<P>

In the last month of 1195 Nemyer was contacted by Traders from the Dawn
League
in Nicosia (Aubaine) Subsector. After a series of short diplomatic
initiatives,
Nemyer agreed to a few basic trade provisions and regular interstellar-trade
begins.  In 1197
Nemyer agrees to join the League of the New Dawn, which is shortly renamed
the
Dawn League.  In honor of the new dawn breaking over the Old Expanses, the
Council of Technarchs renames the planet, Oriflamme: the Golden Flame
inspiring
devotion and courage.  After the Twelve were lost, the League is reformed as
the
Reformation Coalition and Oriflamme, in which Oriflamme has taken a major
role.<P>

With a population of eight hundred million, Oriflamme is allowed eighty
representatives in the Assembly of Worlds. The Council of Technarchs
divided Oriflamme in to 80 district and apportions votes to each Trust
or Holding in each district according to their economic power contained
in that district. The Trusts and Holdings then vote for a representative
for that district.  Since many Trusts have assets in many districts they
receive votes in each of those districts.  There is often quite alot of
negotiating when it comes to vote, as one Trusts trades its support in
one district for support from another Trust in another district.  The
districts
are reassessed every ten years for changes in the economics of the Trusts.
The next year the districts select representatives to the Assembly.
Representatives can serve as long as they are reelected.  Representatives
can be recalled by a supermajority (75%) of the Trusts from their districts.
So far this has not happened, but it was included in case a representative
becomes mentally unstable or loses the confidence of his district.
Representatives are also free to step down at any time, and if they
do so, there is a special election to fill the vacant spot.<P>

<A NAME="political"><H3>Political Structure</H3></A>

The Trusts/Holdings each have areas where they recruit from.  They
recruit the best and brightest from these areas.  The usual way is by
excelling at one of the yearly (Standard years) test.  Also a technarch
could personally select someone for what ever reason the technarch wants.
The people left behind run thier own affairs, running small family owned
businesses, like grocers, stores, personal services, contractor work.
They are the underclass, and the Technarchs regard them as stupid, lazy,
criminals or mentally unstable, otherwise they would be in the employ of
the Technarchs.  Some of this is true, but there are also the unlucky, or
those who want to go it alone, and try to start a Holding from scratch.
It is these people who are being shipped to Poyzen.<P>
 

In the rural areas, almost everyone works for
a Trust. There are very few private farmers, usually located around one of
the Free Cities.  There are also the occasional loner/hermit who lives
alone in the wilderness.  There a few isolated survialist groups, who think
the government is just a bunch of bandits with delisions of grandeur.
These survivalists tend to isolate themselves from everyone else in the
world. There are a few thousand of these people in dozens of isolated bands.
They are not a movement or anything approaching that level of organization.
Many of the groups do not trust each other.  Nemyer was a planet with seven
billion people, now that there is less than one billion.  There is alot of
room that isn't being used and small groups can easily hide out.<P>

A key to understanding modern Oriflamme society is to remember that
this system was not designed, it evolved.  That means that the
administration of cities is not uniform and is often based on
precedent or ad hoc organization.  One city may be totally controlled,
run, and owned by a single Trust which may lease out buildings or
districts to other Trusts for their use with all city services still
being centralized.  Other cities are run by a patchwork of Trusts
with particular city services being traditionally provided by individual
Trusts and other services by other Trusts.  Lastly, some cities could be
totally chaotic with each Trust owning and running blocks of the city but
not having any centralized organization so that city services, law
enforcement and so on vary from district to district with some areas not
being under the direct control of anyone.<P>

<A NAME="military"><H3>Military</H3></A>


The Marines and Navy are a world body, but the Army is raised locally.  When
requested the Trusts and Holdings need to provide troops to the Government.
They
then serve under a central command, which is normally composed of Marine
officers. For instance, during the occupation of Spencer, many Household
troops
were sent to Spencer after the initial landings. Once the peacekeeping
portion
of the mission started, the main body of the Marines were pulled out to be
used
in more active pursuits.  This adds a political edge to Spencer, as units
from
different Trusts have have slightly different goals.  The military operation
on
Spencer is commanded by a group of Marine officers, whose loyalty is to the
Technarch Council, and not individual Technarchs.<P>

While the Navy is a world body, there is no laws prohibiting the ownership
of armed vessels by individual Trusts. There was not becuase the Council
of Technarchs wanted to encourage private navies, it was just created when
there were no operational shipyards, and Trusts and Holdings were
not about to give up the few ships that they did own.  Many of the ships
were purchased by the Council to make up the Nemyer Navy.  Since
the Dawn League made contact with the planet, Oriflamme has started
to produce ships of its own.  Many of these ships are for use by the
planetary navy, but some have been purchased by individual Trusts.
A majority of these have been for exploration and trade with the
other worlds of the RC and the Wilds.<P>


Originally the household troops were used to wage war against other
Trusts and Holdings, there hasn't been such a war since interstellar trade
was reopened.  Instead the Trusts have devoted their expansion to other
worlds.   Some Trusts have mounted  indpenedent expeditions to the Wilds,
though many of these are little more than raiding parties.  Some
Trusts are thinking about mounting larger campaigns of conquest
particularly against those planets with low technology or small
populations.  The Council of Technarchs has not been able
to come to a firm conclusion on how any such conquests would
be administrated. Would they be beholden to Oriflamme or would they
be independent worlds.  It is a question that will probably not be
decided until it actually becomes an issue. Then it will decide on
which Trust or Holding is responsible and how much power they can
wield in the Council.<P>

While there has been no open warfare between Trusts, economic
espionage is rampant.  Some of the Trusts have had long standing
grudges with other Trusts and these occasionally break out into
isolated violent incidents, but the Council of Technarchs has prevented
these from breaking into full scall war.  For the most part the
various Trusts get along, and most disputes are settled by
the Council of Technarchs.<P>

<A NAME="free"><H3>Free Cities</H3></A>


During the collapse while most people started to ignore government and turn
to
the Notables, some politicians were able to hold their territory together
well
enough that social services didn't collapse, and people still gave their
loyalty
to the government rather than individuals.  In 1200 these Free Cities
operate
much as they did before the Collapse, people pay taxes, and recieve various
benifits.  The Cities offer very few social services, but they offer police
protection, sanitation, and other basic infrastructure. They also offer some
minimal amount of food to those without any source of income. This food is
of
low quality, but it keeps people from starving while they get back on their
feet. Gruel lines are a common occurance in the Free Cities.<P>

The Free Cities have had to sign treaties with the Trusts, allowing them
much
greater access and freedom of movement in exchange for resources and defense
arrangments.  Employees of the Trusts are exempt from many of the lesser
laws,
such as speeding,
littering, and if arrested for more serious crimes, they receive a lighter
punishment,
more often fines, and exile, rather than prison and execution.  The Trusts
are
expected
to make sure their employees obey the laws and don't rampage around the
city.
The
Trusts are also allowed to build small enclaves in the cities.  These are
treated
much like embassies are treated today.  They are regarded as part of the
Trusts'
territory.  In exchange for these benifits, the Trusts agree to guarentee
the
safe existence of the Free Cities and also pledge a certain amount of annual
contributions.<P>

The Free Cities are neutral ground for the Trusts, people who are normally
enemies can meet and talk over a drink.  Battles between enemies are
supposed to
be kept out of the cities, and if two Trusts start a battle in the city, the
other Trusts will help the City stop it, by lending troops or security
personal.  Of course this just pushes all of the dirty work underground.
This
makes it a great place for adventurers to hang out. There are 5 Free Cities,
with a total population of 8.5 million people.<P>
