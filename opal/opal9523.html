   <P>

Bulariawas settled by the Darrians in -1209 as an
agricultural source colony for the expanding
Confederacy.
 <P>
Development was hindered by the Bularia fever, a minor
but persistent viral disease that contaminated the
local air and water.  While rarely fatal to people who
contracted it,  the virus acted like an acute form of
meningitis, incapacitating its victims for days.
People infected often have recurring bouts, though the
 severity declines as immunity is built up. With most
of the early colonists laid up by the virus, the world
was still in an early stage of development when the
Maghiz hit a few years later.
 <P>
Most of the colony died off in the next thousand
years, the victim of a small gene pool. The world was
recontacted by a small Solomani colony ship in -433,
and its passengers and crew abandoned their failing
vessel to settle on the surface, despite its viral
taint. The system was finally recontacted by the
reexpanding Darrian Confederacy in -202, but it lay
too far away for it to be reabsorbed.
 <P>
The local were desperate for contact after centuries
of isolation, but they lacked any resources beyond
local agriculture, which offworlders refused to buy
because of the viral taint.  Their economic salvation
came in the early part of the Imperial expansion from
an unlikely source. A contact team from the Imperial
Megacorp Naasirka chanced upon Bularia in 250, and
discovered that the natives had a high quality low
tech electronics industry. The company had been
looking, with little success, for a world skilled in
low tech electronics for export to other TL 3-6 worlds
around the Imperium, and Bularia's "hobby" fit the
bill.
 <P>
For most of Imperial period, the Bularia "Tube"
industry was their economic mainstay.  And Naasirka
showed remarkable restraint and responsibility for an
Imperial Megacorp in their dealings with the locals.
Naasirka's local managers and employees became quite
attached to the hardworking and quiet locals, and when
the company had to pull out of Marches during the
Civil War, most of the Vilani-born employees refused
to leave, and continued to work and run the factories.
In the period of Hard Times, Bularia found a massive
export market in Corridor and even more remote parts
of the Imperium, in some cases their products were
carried down through the Aslan Hierate into Reaver's
Deep, Daibei and Diaspora.
 <P>
But then the world almost became the casualty of the
Collapse, when its markets were destroyed in the
ensuing chaos. And when the Darrians moved into a
military confrontation with Garoo (SM 0130) the planet
became a battlefield.  The Bularia incident is best
described elsewhere but it stemmed from the
longtime animosity between the Republic of Garoo and
the Darrian Confederacy, and it was instigated by a
Darrian-assisted revolt on Garoo's colony of Uniqua
(0129). Coupled with the Confederacy's recent victory
over the Sword Worlders on <a href="opal9502.html">Ator</A>, and their subsequent
absorption of the world, Garoo correctly ascertained
that the Darrians were set to expand further into
their former rimward territory.
 <P>
The Garoo Republican Navy and Army invaded the worlds
of Kardin (SM 0429), Dorannia (SM 0529) and Bularia in
early 1133. Despite being at a severe technological
disadvantage compared to the modest Darrian
"Protector" Forces already on those worlds, the
Garooians achieved total suprise and moved ruthlessly
to destroy these forces. The Confederacy was quick to
respond, sending a large task force to the cluster
four months later. Republican forces were overrun on
Kardin and Dorannia, but the counterattack on Bularia
bogged down in the face of fanatical resistance, aided
in part by the locals who wanted to be no part of the
Confederacy.
 <P>
Things got really complicated afterwards, as the
Zhodani Consulate threatened to intervene on the
behalf of Garoo. And several Zhodani ships skirmished
with DCN vessels at Bularia and Dorannia.  The
Confederacy sent an appeal to the Regency for aid, and
a massive task force of the 208th Fleet arrived at
Bularia in early 1134 in response.  But the Regency
reminded all of the warring parties that the contested
world was a Regency client state, and that it and no
one else would determine it's final disposition. With
that veiled threat hanging in the air, both the
Republic/Consulate and the Confederacy forces withdrew
under heavy Regency naval escort.
 <P>
As a result of this fracas, the Regency increased its
patrols along the Foreven/Marches interface,
eventually covincing many of the worlds in the region
to become Regency client states. Garoo gave up most of
its bankrupt empire to become a protectorate. The
Darrians intensified their cooperation with the
Regency, and shored up their ties with the Zhodani.
And Bularia had its damage repaired, recieved a
Regency Army garrison, and once again prospers, thanks
to careful marketing of its goods.
