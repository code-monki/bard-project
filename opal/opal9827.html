This world's name comes from the high levels of algae
in its ocean water, giving the world a blue-green
coloration that is quite striking from space.  Despite
its cold temperatures inland, the moderate seasons and
long growing year of the coastal regions attracted
truck farmers to this world as early as the 390s.
Year round supplies of naturally grown fruits and
vegetables are a major source of income for this
underdeveloped world. This moderate climate also
attracts large numbers of seasonal visitors wanting a
"summer home" for whatever reasons.  Land shortages
prompted cool attitudes to new offworld immigration,
and the current government was established three
hundred years ago to ensure equitable distribution and
access, though in reality it has favored large
landholders and offworld corps.  This engrained
conservatism makes Peridot one of the most vocal of
Free Soil worlds, and several factions have been
implicated in terrorist operations against both local
and offworld Aslan, and an increasing number of human
reformers as well.
