Hepring is one of the four worlds that makes up the
Torinsk cluster. A cool world, it is in orbit around
the innermost of the systems three gas giants, and has
two sibling moons that are marginally habitable. The
world is shrouded in thick clouds of CO2, sulfur
dioxide and methane, the result of extensive volcanism
in its oceans and on land.
<P>
Hepring was originally settled during the Chodlot
period by Zhodani from Ziafrplians sector. Despite its
oftentimes deadly taint, the world's soils were well
developed enough for agriculture, and a colony that
peaked at around 500,000 prospered on the main
continent of Chdliarians.  An extensive belt of grain
farms were developed, as well as grazing ranges for
Noqls genetically modified to handle the taint. By the
time of the founding of the Avalar Consulate, it had
become a moderate breadbasket world.
<P>
The colony was transferred, along with all other
Zhodani holdings in Titan Subsector, to the Avalar
Consulate, who showed little interest in developing
the world. A small trickle of colonists from other
Avalar worlds moved in, but relations with the local
Zho population were rather chilly, and they were never
 significant contributors. The Zhodani had little
liking for the Avalar government, feeling that they
were better off under the old Zhodani administration,
and being generally uncomfortable with the
inconsistencies inherent to Avalar culture.  This
chill became an irritant for the Consulate government
when its interest in Titan and Xenough subsectors
intensified in the latter 700s.
<P>
At this time an independent <a href="opal9351.html">Xenough</A> was beginning to
expand its reach to Mahir and Torinsk, and the seeds
for a later military confrontation with the Avalar
government were being laid. But at the time the
Consulate government was more concerned with the
increasingly rebellious Zhodani on Hepring than with
the upstart Syndicrate.  A series of confrontations in
797-802 led to a hostilities between the Zhodani and
Avalar filibusters. Xenough Syndari mercenaries were
imported by both sides to fight, and their officers
got and eyeful of the world's fecundity and extensive
farm infrastructure.  With Xenough and her daughters
suffering from chronic food shortages in those days,
the possibility of seizing the world for their own
needs became increasingly attractive. And to do it
from under the noses of the snooty Avalars would make
it a delightfully retributive act.
<P>
The Syndari units began defenestrating their weaker
employers and taking over their holdings. Oftentimes
Syndari would working for the Avalars would coordinate
their raids to eliminate the Zhodani landholders and
their staff, leaving their brethren working for the
Zhodani in a better position to secure the now vacant
land for themselves. By 810, Syndari units held the
bulk of the world for themselves, and with help from
the homeworlds they evicted or eliminated the
troublesome Avalars. Their shrewd employment of
Highburian mercs helped secure their position against
terrorist attacks from Avalar, and by 820 the world
was completely under their control. This occupation
was the beginning of the long century and a half
conflict between Avalar and its allies, and the
Torinsk cluster.
<P>
Today Hepring has grown into a major industrial power
in its own right.  Most of the population lives in
large oceanic or orbital arcologies that permit the
continents to continue food production for the
remainder of the cluster.  Unlike the other Torinsk
cluster worlds, Hepring is dominated by the Syndari
caste, aside from the nominal Rakhmani leadership.
Hepring is on the frontline against the "Zeidar"
(abominable offworlders) and a heavy military presence
has been needed ever since the Xenough Wars of the
800s. Its offworld contact makes it less xenophobic
than the other Kopol worlds, but its populace is
militant and disdainful of the rest of the Consulate.
Military industries are in heavy evidence, though
these are mostly for show as a deterrence against the
Zidar.
