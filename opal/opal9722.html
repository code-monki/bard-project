Gloire was originally settled about a thousand years
ago, during one of the last sublight missions. Despite
its high surface temperatures, the world was fertile
and biochemically compatible enough to sustain human
habitation. The pastoral population proved impotent in
the face of Serendip aggression, who conquered the
world a few scant years after its recreation of the
<I>Eldorado</I>'s jump drives.  When Imperial Scouts
distributed jump drive technology to the rest of the
Islands, their combined military pressure forced the
Serendips to briefly abandon Gloire.  But the
Serendips reconquered the world in 1048 after a quid
pro quo was reached with Esperanza.
<P>
Serendip's plans for further expansion have long
depended upon Gloire and its agricultural wealth, and
they have ruled their colony with a couple fingers
short of an iron fist.  The local populace eventually
surrendered all hope of liberation, and collaborated
fully with its overlords. The world was severly
damaged by New Colchis raids during the Islands War,
raids that destroyed many settlements and the main
starport. Heavy damage to Serendip itself necessitated
its monopoly of resources for itself, and large parts
of Gloire are still blasted and broken from the war.
<P>
Repression intensified in the war's aftermath, as
Serendip became more reliant upon locally raised
foodstuffs for its own population. Most of this
repression was economic, as food prices were set
artificially low. Production has suffered as a result,
and the long suffering population finally lost
patience enough to engage in "passive-aggressive
terrorism." Attempts to crack down on this resistance
has further alienated the local populace, and the
situation will feed of itself until Serendip can
rebuild its agro production and finds an alternate
offworld source.
<P>
Gloire is the site of RQB Valdivia, the main terminus
base for RQS/RPKF operations in the Islands. All ship
traffic en route to the Regency must pass through
inspection here. Inspections are mostly cursory, as
stricter inspections await at Zuflucht. Valdivia is
located in orbit above Gloire, and has a seperate
C-class starport that is reserved for RQS and Regency
Naval vessels. Because of the importance of this
facility, Gloire is rated Amber, and local RQS patrols
are not notable for their patience.  In the last ten
years the presence of the base and its nonforebearing
guardians has emboldened the local opposition.
