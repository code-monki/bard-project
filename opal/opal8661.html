Aosta was established as an Imperial Reserve in 474 by
the order of the Empress Nicholle. It is unique in
that it was, and still is the only world established
for the study of marine life collected by the IISS in
its explorations. The world is offlimits to all but
accredited researchers, who live in the orbital
Galapagos station during their tenure here.
<P>
Specially equipped submersibles are used for research
purposes, and strict environmental guidelines are
enforced at all times. Most of these submarines are
waterjet or new tractor propelled designs that permit
quiet operation and lowered environmental impact. The
collection is irreplaceable as a result of the
Collapse, and Ministry of Interior Wilderness Rangers
patrol the world in armed g-carriers to prevent theft
and poaching. The rangers also feed and care for local
sea life, as most of the introduced species are
incapable of drawing sustenance from the local
ecosystem because of biological incompatibility.
<P>
What dry land exists is also offlimits to offworlders,
and the Rangers make their bases and observations
posts here. The world is defended to TL-15 standards
and include a full air and space defense network and
armed interdiction satellites.
