Nordstrom is a blue-black marble streaked with jagged
yellow and white clouds.  The world's atmosphere is a
cocktail of nitrogen, water vapor and carbon dioxide
so dense that it forms a sea of compressed gas that is
about 50 kms in depth.  The bottomost layer is
actually a vast world ocean of oxygen poor water that
obscures all land beneath a black curtain.  When the
world was first discovered by the Zhodani in -235,
their surveys discounted the world as anything more
than a curiosity. A later survey chanced upon the
world's unusual life, and the world became a major
research station that is still in place to this day.
<P>
Nordstroms' native life is unusual because it does not
distinguish between the various layers, seperating the
ocean from the air so to speak.  The upper fluid
layers are practically moving rivers of silt and
organics, which are collected and consolidated by
airborne plants and animals that float freely through
the gloom.  These airborne lifeforms can range from
microbes to giant gas buoyed or gliding forms the size
of starships.  Plant life create vast "magic carpets"
that float at various levels of atmospheric buoyancy,
often growing to the size of city blocks in the form
of trees that grow outwards in a circle from a central
point.  The deep oceanic layers are dominated by
bizarre anaerobic lifeforms that are still poorly
understood by modern science, but which grow into even
more immense and bizarre shapes. The ecosphere is
three dimensional and vertical, with diversity
depending upon the amount of nutrients, wind and
current velocity, and the amount of sunlight recieved.
<P>
The local economy is agricultural in nature, and is
dominated by farming and harvesting of the huge, rapid
moving streams of silt and fluid that exist at the "30
kilometer greenbelt layer." While the M5V primary is
rather dim, more useful energy for plant growth comes
from the high amounts of infrared and microwave
radiation trapped by the gas mix.  This coupled with
the low ambient light at the 30 km layer creates an
eerie gloom against which the locals harvest such
bizarre crops like the Anonymous Berry (a gelatinous
seed that can be squished into any shape), Green
Oyster (a plant with a clam-like protective shell),
and the Spear-Mint (A pungent, streamlined edible
plant that resembles a 10 meter long javelin, which
can fly at very high velocities). The world is
self-sufficient in foodstuffs, and has significant
exports to Avalars main industrial worlds.
<P>
Most of the population lives either in orbit, or
ingenious submersible cities of local manufacture,
that are capable of bouncing between the layers
indefinitely. These cities are generally large sphere
of asteroidal rock or metal, up to 5 kms in diameter,
that are hollowed out and their contents are placed on
gimbals and gyroscopically stabilised. Nevertheless
the locals are incredibly surefooted within the
constant turbulence of living in a jet stream of
compressed gas, and their survival skills is akin to a
desert nomads'. The local culture has the feel of a
nomad society, albeit one where it is the community
that travels from here to there with limited input
from their inhabitants.  While their lives are
precarious, the locals seem to bear up with incredible
fortitude, wit and patience, and they are suprisingly
disparaging of the abilities of other Avalar
populations.
<P>
Unfortunately, Nordstrom has come under very heavy
pressure from Zhodani refugees in the last year, and
an alarming rise in corsair raiding as well.  This
combined pressure has overwhelmed the narrow balance
of survival that the local streamriders were
subsisting upon.  Refugees have been dumped on
Nordstrom's airless moon, Gottenvald, in horribly
crowded and deprived conditions with little food an no
sanitation. Recent raids by "Zhodani" corsairs and
marauders have escalated tensions between the locals
and their new neighbors, and several retaliatory
atrocities have been reported.  Recently the Avalar
military was invited to take over the planetary
government, and that includes the locals flagging
policing and relief efforts.
