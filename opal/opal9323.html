Hinatanpyl was settled by colonists from Avalar around
760 as a safe containment facility for the Consulates
most dangerous industries.  Chemical, radiological,
genetic, pharmaceutical and refining plants were
constructed in huge subterranean tunnels leading from
the main downport.  To man these facilities,
unemployed or convict labor were exported, and settled
into quarters right alongside their work areas.
<P>
The world quickly obtained the reputation as a
dangerous purgatory for non-conforming elements of
Avalar's society.  Work accidents were frequent, and
the death toll due to exposure or industrial accidents
was frightfully high.  Because of its semi-penal
nature, the main governing authority was a group of
different policing agencies and paramilitary units,
each of which oversaw a particular industrial sector,
utility or government service.
<P>
Hard economic times in the period before the Fifth
Frontier War, and declining output due to
contamination of living spaces and failing systems,
led to a period of strife between the various security
services.  A series of coups and juntas cobbled out of
the different services, still battle for supremacy to
this day.  The current Junta is composed of forces
loyal to the main electrical and water utilities, and
a number of industrial concerns.  Their main
opposition are the air generating utility, the
containment service and starport security forces.
<P>
Travel to Hinatanpyl is not advised, and it is
strongly recommended that travellers that do visit the
system should do their business at one of the two
highports. The conflict between the various factions
has created an environment of escalating paranoia and
extremely uptight security on the surface.  It is not
uncommon for either the locals or visitors to be
arrested and imprisoned on the flimsiest of pretexts,
and are often subject to torture or disappearance.
Various terrorist cells are operated by a few
factions, and offworlders are a favorite target for
attack or kidnapping.
