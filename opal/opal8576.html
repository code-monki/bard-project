Cabrini is the site of several major Ling Standard
production plants. Mostly these are chemical and mine
processing units that extract raw materials from the
highly saline oceans. LSP obtained the local scout
base as a means of providing additional income for the
starport. The world's commercial value has declined
since the Civil War and Collapse, and the factories
were mostly shuttered. The majority of its money is
now made through the port, as traffic transits from
Sabinar Main to the Star Lane and Spinward Marches.
The local law level permits nearly every form of
traffic and commerce possible, a practice encouraged
by the company managers, and scrutinised by large RQS
patrols.
