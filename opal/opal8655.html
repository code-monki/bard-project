Byblos was originally colonised in two waves during
the period of 710 to 800. The original colonists,
known as Freitlats, were subjugated by the smaller
second wave known as the Uverstad, and are considered
second class citizens. The world's government is
dominated by a military dictatorship composed of
Uverstad officers, many of whom also control the local
economy through networks of nepotism and government
monopoly. Freitlats are confined to menial labor and
are prohibited from attaining more than a basic
secondary school education. <P>
The disparities between the two groups led to frequent
rebellions in the Antebellum period, and continued
unabated into the Post-Collapse period. But since the
Collapse, millions of displace Vargr have arrived on
the world, and their more advanced technology has
deterred Uverstad efforts at ejecting them. The Escape
Clause permitted millions of Freitlats to migrate to
the Safe as cheap labor, and these have formed large
expatriate colonies on Deneb and Dekha where they have
pooled their money and their common opposition to the
government. Growing alliances between these
expatriates and Vargr migrants has led to terroristic
attacks by Uverstad hit squads, on both the homeworld
and against various safeside communities.
