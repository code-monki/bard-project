Halfway across Xenough, on the teeming trade route
between the Torinsk cluster and the Kamrathi worlds,
lies the insular world of Nesturgi.  Nearly all of the
trade that passes between Torinsk and the neighboring
Titan subsector passes through its ports en route to
Lenin and its daughters, yet this river of activity
scarcely scratches its surface. For Nesturgi's human
habitations are quite ancient by Foreven's standards,
and the local culture is too governed by the ebb and
flow of its oceans and islands to be easily diverted
by mere commerce.
<P>
The world is governed by its oceans, as ninety two
percent of it its covered with water. The world is
quite young, less than 1.6 bilion years old, and
massive seafloor volcanism continues to add mantle
moisture to the already deep oceans. The world orbits
Sugoi, a hot F9V main sequence star, and its proximity
makes Nesturgi quite hot. Higher evaporation creates
massive fog and cloud banks, and a swirl of wind, rain
and lightning often dominates its horizons. Native
life is limited to marine microorganisms, and the
local atmosphere is still largely bereft of sufficient
oxygen for free respiration by offworld lifeforms
without assistance from respirators. And everywhere
ones senses are assualted with the smell of sea salt,
for one can not leave the sea behind, ever.
<P>
Most of Nesturgi's land is volcanic and plutonic
island arcs of granitic and rhyolitic composition. The
local landscape is reminiscent of Iceland, or bare
regions of New Zealand on old Terra.  Most islands are
still host to massive volcanism, ranging from large
calderas to geysers and other geothermal features.  No
land life existed before colonisation, and the first
colony almost died off from a lack of soil for the
cultivation of crops. Imported terrestrial marine and
avian life now dominate the seas, and the island arcs
are covered with grasses and trees from offworld.
<P>
The first colonists came here from Tepenke (Foreven
1926) around -1122, leaving behind a world whose
population was diligently attending upon an endless
cycle of civil strife and genocide.  They were
outcasts and victims, and they chose Nesturgi in the
belief that adversity would cause them to forget the
horrors of their homeworld and the losses they had
suffered. Perversity and horror had always dogged
their ancestors; before Tepenke it had been the
controversy that had split their colonial fleet after
it had crossed the Great Rift; before then it had been
the final decay of the Ramshackle Empire and the
bloodshed and cruelty of its collapse, and the cause
of their long, cold migration. Nesturgi's world-ocean
and its endless tableau seemed uncaring and formless,
not knowing any past or future, and cast its amnesiac
spell upon the colonists.
<P>
Over the next six centuries, they eked out a life on
the cliffs and tors overlooking the sea, one
countless, uncomplaining generation after another. For
a couple hundred years they relied upon the stocks of
offworld marine life introduced into the local oceans,
waiting for the lichens, mosses and grasses they had
planted to break down the mountain rock into soil
suitable for raising crops or fodder.  They carefully
terraced the hill and mountainsides for for crop
planting, and for the collection of rainwater and
snow.  Forests were planted to slow the erosion of the
highlands, and offworld fauna was carefully introduced
to each island after enough time had elapsed.
<P>
Contact with the Zhodani came in -409, but nothing
much ever amounted from it because of the distance
between the two groups, both astrographically and
culturally. Some trade resulted, mostly for offworld
amenities. But more importantly it fired the
Nesturgians to acquire spare parts for their derelict
starships, allowing them to forge back into space in
search of new markets for their emerging economy. By
-360 they had recontacted their brethren on Tepenke
and Dibelon, and established trade ties with <a href="opal9351.html">Xenough.</A>
But their enthusiasm for offworld contact waned as
quickly as it had built, and they eventually turned
over their small trading empire to their neighbors in
return for security.  From -360 until 516, they were a
possession of Xenough. And then a part of the Kamrathi
League until 890, when the Avalar Consulate took over.
 <P>

Economically the world is tied into export trade to
either end of the great trade route, usually minerals
to Lenin, and agricultural and aquacultural products
to Xenough and the rest of Torinsk.  Undersea mining
is the most lucrative trade, even though technological
constraints force the local mining companies to rely
more upon manned undersea mining platforms like the
<A HREF="vera/vera2003.html"><i>Tiamat</i></A> and
<A HREF="../vera/vera2004.html"><i>Gashedda</i> </A>, rather than remote or robotic
units to gather and process the ore.
<P>
These platforms are amphibious, and sink themselves to
the deep abyssal plains with the aid of ballast or
water tanks. Ore is collected, and ballast is ejected,
until the carrier is full, in which case it disgorges
its load into undersea conveyors and elevators for
transit back to the surface. The continental shelf
region is also scarred with mines and zig-zagging
roads for the mining platforms.  Most mining work is
actually done by men in pressure sealed exoskeletons,
usually the locally produced JS-29 "Jumbo Shrimp"
Power Suit. Most minerals collected from the seafloor
are manganese nodules created by volcanic processes,
and collected from the abyssal plains they blanket in
a vast ooze.
<P>
Mining activities are supplemented by large
aquaculture farms for kelp and edible algae. Coral
reefs introduced by the original colonists permit
limited fish farming. Dry land agriculture is mostly
grain and animal husbandry, usually wheat and sheep,
though this is supplemented by a gamut of fiber crops
like flax and cotton.  While dull, these products are
in high demand on neighboring worlds, and a textile
industry has grown up to produce natural linens and
wools desired by nearby high-pop worlds. The local
heavy industries are limited to either servicing the
large local starports. While Nesturgi has a listing of
TL C, this is mostly limited to the downports and
their surrounds, and more commonly the TL is 9 to A.
<P>
Most transportation and electrical equipment are
locally produced, however, though most of these are
tried and true offworld designs. Grav vehicles are
rare due to their expense and the lack of local
expertise in their manufacture. Most air vehicles are
either ACVs, like the <A HREF="../vera/vera4501.html">  <I>Tavee-Gho</I></A>, or PARWIG and
compound helicopter designs. Where islands are in
close proximity, they are linked by causeways and
undersea tunnels of local design and manufacture carry
pipelines, railroads and highways.
<P>
The locals are extremely insular, often reminiscent of
villagers in seaside locales on Terra such as Scotland
and Greece. For the most part they are disinterested
in offworld affairs and the greater universe, aside
from a few imported amenities. Their traditional
culture is often painfully at odds with the Avalar
mainstream. Travellers will notice that the downports
and the local naval base are at a far remove from most
nearby communities, and overworld transit links are
hard to find and obtain. But while they are
indifferent to offworld contact, they are not to
offworlders who show a genuine interest in learning
the local cant.  Travellers should be warned, however,
that things move REALLY slow on Nesturgi.
<P>
<h3>Quarantine Checkpoint Epsilon</h3>
<P>
Nesturgi is strategically located along one of the
main trade routes between the worlds of the former
Kamrathi League, and the remainder of the Avalar
Consulate. This route is a high capacity artery, as
trade from Lenin and its daughters is conveyed to the
Torinsk cluster and the Avalar Corridor. The cutthroat
competitive business practices of Kamrathi merchants,
lingering Anti-Avalar hostility on Lenin and its
former worlds, and the corruption of the Kamrathi
clusters quarantine personnel makes smuggling and
cheating of the quarantine regulations a frequent
occurence in the region.  Ships moving through the
Kamrathi region from worlds in Urnian and Reidain
subsectors are infrequently challenged by local
patrols, and often get past inspections through
contributions to the "charity funds" of local
inspection stations.  A sizeable percentage of this
illicit trade is quickly transferred to
Inter-Consulate traders, and is funneled through
Nesturgi (Foreven 2128) or Merghy (Foreven 2231), with
the lion's share through the former.
<P>
Nesturgi itself is at best a fair world, possessing TL
12, a population of 25 million, and an abundance of
underwater resources harvested for export to Lenin and
the Torinsk Cluster. The world has a very large B
class starport to help faciliatate traffic flow
between the two endpoints, and frontier refueling
sources are plentiful.  It does not help that the
indigenous population is mostly indifferent to
offworld contact, and barely tolerant of Consulate
authority.
This isolationism hardly hinders local connivance in
smuggling rings. Money is a universal language in
every advanced culture. Poor fisher and miner families
can obtain a fairly comfortable living for "potting"
contraband goods, either providing safehouses for
smuggled goods for later pick-up, or safe landing
fields and labor for "booking" cargo from one vessel
to another that has quarantine certification.
<P>
Thanks to the generosity of smugglers, the locals are
notoriously keen in impeding Consulate authorities in
their crackdown on this trade. Cooperation between the
locals and Quarantine personnel is nearly nonexistent,
and it is impossible to tell how many local officials
are on the take, or at least are encouraged to look
the other way. Most smuggling involves uncertified
(and duty-free) goods from either the Regency, or its
allied worlds in Reidain and Fessor Subsectors.  The
most lucrative products are naturally those that the
Avalar Consulate has placed high protective tariffs
upon in order to preserve its industrial monopolies:
pharmaceuticals, weaponry and advanced electronics.
<P>
As a result of this trade, the Avalar Navy took
drastic measures about fifty years ago in an effort to
stem the flow of goods. Arrival by starship in the
Nesturgi system necessitates a visit to the Avalar
Quarantine Checkpoint Epsilon. This is required of all
ships regardless of their destination or point of
origin. Vessels that do not check in with a Quarantine
system, or attempt to violate regulations, will be
confiscated without exception, and the crew will be
incarcerated for up to ten years.  The effectiveness
of this blockade is difficult to assess, for smuggling
continues, thanks to the very high prices that
imported goods fetch in the coreward reaches of the
Consulate.
<P>
Checkpoint Epsilon is one of a network of similar
stations located around the periphery of the Avalar
Consulate. In Avalar practice, interface worlds are
only those border worlds with an A or B class
starport. Designation of these checkpoints moves
counterclockwise from a starting point in Titan
Subsector.  All of these facilities are a naval base
in miniature, and are home to between 50 and 60
inspection ships, SDBs and their uncounted small
craft. Interface/Quarantine facilities are under the
jurisdiction of the Avalar 6th Fleet, regardless of
which other regional fleet boundaries they would
normally fall under.  The 6th Fleet itself has only
existed since the signing of the Spinward Accords, and
is the Avalar equivalent of the RQS and other Spinward
Quarantine agencies.
<P>
Epsilon is the largest Quarantine facility in the
Avalar Consulate, and rivals large Regency facilities.
The scope of its operations has necessitated an
unusually large naval presence in what was otherwise
an above-average backwater system.  To save on manning
costs and preserve the strength of naval squadrons,
the Quarantine in Nesturgi is enforced mainly by fixed
facilities, orbital stations, remote sensor platforms
and large numbers of minefields, both sentinel and
captor.
<P>
Ships arriving insystem will be routed to any number
of thirty or so "habs" in Byoen's orbit 200.  These
are large spacedocks capable of handling ships of up
to 100,000 tons displacement, and up to  eight ships
at a time.  Ships of more than 100,000 tons
displacement are routed to the main Epsilon base for
inspection. Each hab has a fighter wing of surplus
Zhodani Vlastebr fighters, 1-3 SDBs, and a number of
SecDets armed and equipped for Zero-G operations. Each
hab is heavily armored, and equipped with bay lasers
and missles.
<P>
Nesturgi is nominally under the jurisdiction of the
4th Fleet, to which the Kamrathi Cluster and the
trailing- coreward quadrant are assigned. But given
the strong lingering nationalist sympathies among its
rank and file, the local 4th contingent is considered
subordinate to the local 6th Fleet command structure.
This arrangement tends to create as many problems as
it solves, as the two units are obligated to maintain
seperate bases, logistics and security cordons.
Nevertheless, the 4th's vessels are subject to
inspection by quarantine vessels/facilities and their
SecDets.
<P>
Total local 6th Fleet strength is approx. 75-80
vessels, a massive number even by Regency standards.
Half of these vessels are jump capable Zhodani patrol
designs like the Dliatsev Patrol Frigate (see
http://www.pcisys.net/~goldendj/Traveller/Admiralty/Ships/Military/Dliatsev.html
for details) various Shivva class frigates and
escorts, and modified Zhdits Destroyer Escorts. A
handful of Regency/Imperial derived designs, such as
Gazelles, have begun to appear in recent years. The
remainder of the garrison is primarily SDBs and
monitors, notably the Caprice class Moniter, a TL-13
Imperial design license built for the Avalar Consulate
on Xenough. About 10,000 personnel are stationed on
the main Epsilon station, and these rotate out on a 4
days on, 4 days off, 48 hour shift schedule to
minimise fatigue and boredom. Each inspection hab has
about 300-400 personnel, with armed SecDets comprising
about a third of those.
<P>
A typical Avalar SecDet numbers 12 to 20 heavily armed
marines, accompanied by a six to eight man inspection
crew. The latter are normally locals hired and trained
by the navy. This permits less strain on naval
personnel and manning.  These personnel are constantly
monitored by Shanza psionic police to maintain their
loyalty and reliability. Shanza "sweepers" are
regularly assigned to SecDets, though their numbers
vary in accordance to the number of crew and
passengers on board a ship. Sweepers do not wear
distinguishing uniforms or any other marking that
would identify them during an inspection, and other
SecDet personnel will not betray their cover.
<P>
Incidentally, electronic psi shields and telepathic
shielding are not permitted during inspection. Psionic
individuals must identify themselves during the
inspection process. Such individuals are politely but
firmly segregated and escorted to a special screening
area for questioning and examination of their baggage
and documentation.  Failure to declare psionic status,
or the use of psionic shielding is a felonious
offence, in case you were wondering.
<P>
Inspection is a two-step process. Because of the
amount of traffic that passes through Nesturgi, the
first inspection is abbreviated if intensive.
Passengers and crew are removed from their ship and go
through normal customs and immigration processing,
regardless of their point of origin or destination.
Inspection takes about 2-3 hours, with SecDets
checking ship documentation, transponders, cargo, and
stores. Weaponry is tagged, as is live cargo. All
ships are then given a provisional pass for entry to
Nesturgi's starports, and they are given an armed
monitor that stays with the vessel the whole time it
is in transit. Ships that fail the inspection, or are
suspected of violating the quarantine regulations are
subject to an even more intensive 24 hour search by a
SecDet, and if theyse are not cleared they are
confiscated, and their masters and crew arrested and
punished accordingly. The Second step of the
inspection comes when a ship stops for maintenance and
refueling at either Taj, the main highport, or at the
main downport at Firsland. Maintenance monitors check
the ships more thoroughly during their mandated 24
hour stopover, and violaters are treated the same way
as detailed above, albeit more quietly, with arrests
of crew and passengers by flying squads being a common
occurence.
<P>
No special priveleges are accorded to any ship, with
the sole exception of diplomatic craft with the proper
documentation and diplomatic pouches.  It should be
noted that some government and military craft only go
through the most cursory of checks; these are usually
affiliated with higher naval commands, the Shanza, and
various high-ranking Venues.
<P>
The main Epsilon station is actually an array of
twenty different facilities, ranging from central
traffic control, to the main COACC command center,
barracks, ship maintenance and inspection stations,
warehouses and sensor/commo arrays.  No private vessel
may approach within 3000 kms of the station, anything
within this perimeter being a free-fire zone. Ships
that persist in approaching will be fired upon with
extreme prejudice.

<P>
<B>System Notes:</B>  The Nesturgi system is mostly typical
for its class, aside from the presence of the
Devourer.<P>

This is an Avalar interface system. Frontier Refueling
is prohibited. All of the other gas giants are mined
and patrolled against intruding vessels. The sole
exception are military and government vessels with
proper IFF codes that bypass the minefield security
grids.  All of the gas giants have guardian naval
facilities in orbit or on one of their moons to detect
and prevent wildcat refuelling. The exception to this
is the base on Hellion, which is primarily a search
and rescue base to extract those stupid enough to
attempt refueling from a Brown Dwarf. Other listening
posts, not listed above, are stationed in the Kuiper
Belt.<P>

Failure to comply or interference with Quarantine
Regulations, and the authority of Quarantine Station
Epsilon, will result in arrest and imprisonment of
crew, seizure and confiscation of vessel and cargo (if
applicable) and permanent curtailing of all trade
priveleges and certifications.



<P><h3> System Features</h3><P>

Visitors to the Zamovar system in antebellum times
were treated to a spectacular visual spectacle. It is
rather atypical for its class. It has a number of
unusual astronomical oddities that are rather
unspectacular in of themselves, but in combination are
much less common. These include a massive brown dwarf,
several spectacular gas giant moon systems, a captured
body in an eccentric inner orbit, and a triple world
system in its outer zone. Nor is the main world a
boring place for the curious. The Collapse and the
emergence of the Quarantine, complicated by tensions
between the Avalar government and Xenough and Kamrathi
has radically curtailed outside visitors access to the
system, but what remains is still quite significant
for the sightseer and the casual tourist.
<P>
<B>Dark Angel:</B> A dark, carbonaecous body of indeterminate
origin. The Angel is a subject of some astronomical
controversy, as its odd composition mark it as alien
to Zamovar and its children. No consensus exists as to
how the Angel came to rest in the hotter inner zone,
without the interference of the gas giants or the
Devourer. Its composition is also odd; for its
primarily Fullerenes, geodesic sphere carbon
molecules, mixed in with high pressure quartz
polymorphs like Cristabolite. These molecules are
usually formed only within the deep mantles of molten
and heavy core worlds, or by meteoritic and cometary
impacts. These seem to indicate that the Angel is
probably ejecta from an apocalyptic deep space
collision, though its chemistry does not indicate what
bodies were responsible. Fullerenes are rather more
stable than most carbon compounds, and a layer of
debris from more recent collisions helps shield them
from disintegrating in Zamovar's intense heat.
<P>
<B>Gas Giants:</B> The three gas giants and one brown dwarf,
and their moon systems, loom over the system. The
innermost of these, Byoen, is located within Zamovar's
life zone.  Typical of a inner zone giant, Byoen is a
rich navy blue, the result of water vapor accumulation
created by solar heating.  Most of the gas giant moons
are uninhabited, and with the exception of Nesturgi
and Particle, rather useless. But since the Collapse,
a naval outpost has been constructed in orbit around
each gas giant, to monitor traffic, and prevent
frontier refueling.
<P>
<B>Nesturgi:</B> The mainworld is 92-93 percent covered by
liquid water. The dense atmosphere is mostly CO2 and
water vapor, with significant CO2 concentrations as a
result of volcanic processes and sluggish
photosynthesis by its native algae. Fortunately, the
higher partial pressure makes up for the low O2
content, though nitrogen narcosis and the bends are
everpresent health hazards. All of the world's dry
land are islands ranging from the fifty thousand
square kilometers Goliath Islands, to small rocky
islets barely the size of a tabletop. The world has a
very hot mantle due to tidal attraction to Byoen and
the other moons, giving rise to greater than average
tectonic activity. Massive seaquakes and "icelandic"
volcanic eruptions are part of normal daily life, as
are the massive tsunamis they create. This tidal
attraction also creates massive fluctuations in
coastlines, and tides of 20 to 30 meters are not
uncommon in the equatorial regions.
<P>
<B>Resonepts-Gamilik-Guidarod:</B> Resonepts is a massive,
ammonia shrouded world with two very large satellites.
Because of their size, Resonepts has a large wobble
within its orbit around Zamovar. While not a true
double or triple world system, gravitational
attraction from Echneis has begun to destabilise its
position, and astronomers calculate that it will be a
triple world system (or at least a double world system
with Guidarod orbiting both) within another ten
million years.
<P>
<B>Devourer:</B>  a huge 485,000 km diameter world that sits
at the boundary between gas giants and stars. The
Devourer is a milky blue-white in appearance, with
occasional splotches created by accretion of cometary
debris. The world recieves its name from its
aggressive cannibalisation of passing Kuiper and Oort
material. Astronomers think that it formed from a
seperate nebular occurence in parallel to Zamovar, as
evidenced by the heavier composition of its moons, and
the fact that if it had formed closer, it would have
accreted enough material to either prevent to creation
of the innermost worlds, and possibly become a binary
star.
<P>
<h3> System Environs and Features of Interest</h3>
<P>
Visitors to Nesturgi are mostly confined to the
vicinity of the mainworld, its sibling moons, and the
immediate 100 diameter vicinity of Byoen. Travel is
prohibited, without permits and an escort, to the
other worlds in the Zamovar system. The only exception
to this are vessels that have commercial contracts
with either the Avalar Consulate Navy, as resupply
vessels carrying supplies to the outer system naval
facilities, or scientific and commercial vessels that
have legitimate reasons (and a clean history) for
working in the outer system.
<P>
<B>Nesturgi:</B> Deep sea mining and aquaculture, as well as
a number of dry land farming ventures, make the world
an important exporter of vital raw materials and
foodstuffs to both the Torinsk and Kamrathi clusters.
Even before the Collapse, a sizeable population called
the world home, and many toiled in massive mining
crawlers and submarines, dredging or mining vital
materials like manganese, copper, iron, chromite,
vanadium, cobalt, niobium and iridium. Gemstones are a
small but profitable side business, primarily emeralds
and sapphires. A number of locals are highly skilled
gun and weaponsmiths, and hand crafted guns and blades
from Nesturgi are prized throughout Foreven, and have
made their way into the hands of collecters in the
Regency and Hierate. As the population has grown from
offworld immigration, more and more money has been
invested in local infrastructure and light industry,
and Regency and Avalaran companies are increasing
their stake in local economic activities.
<P>
<B>Taj:</B> The systems massive highport is only about thirty
years old. The port was constructed after the
establishment of QS Epsilon as a "break-bulk" point
for ships waiting full inspection. Because of this
disruption in the flow of commerce, many corporations
located major facilities to cater to their crews and
itinerant passengers. Originally intended to be only a
stopover point, a considerable amount of industry has
been built into the stations habitation zones, and it
has been expanded several times to accomodate its
burgeoning activity.  While the station is listed at
TL 12, the abundance of imports puts it closer to the
Avalar max of TL 14. The station is home to a
population of 1.4 million mostly permanent
inhabitants. Their culture is more cosmopolitan and
outwardly oriented. The increasing congestion and cost
of business has driven a growing number of companies
to relocate their personnel and plants on Nesturgi
instead. <P>

<B>Quarantine Station Epsilon:</B> All incoming ships will be
making a visit to either Epsilon or its inspection
"habs." Regularly scheduled corp vessels are given
preference over unscheduled independents, and actually
are given inspection windows for exclusive and
expedited processing. As noted in the article on QS
Epsilon, civilian and unauthorised military vessels
are not permitted to approach the station, though
civilian contractor supply vessels are usually given
free access. Epsilon has full starport facilities, and
the only naval maintenance facilities insystem, which
keeps the local, Pro-Kamrathi 4th Fleet garrison under
the iron thumb of the 6th Fleet quarantine squadron.
<P>
<B>Particle:</B> The only other inhabited moon in the Byoen
moon system is home to both a naval
training/monitoring facility, and several massive
nickel and cobalt mines. The miners are mostly
rotating work shifts shuttled in from Nesturgi or the
Taj, as security restrictions limit permanent
residency on the moon. Rumors of alien artifact finds
have always persisted around Particle, and the Avalar
Navy has had a number of covert facilities on here
since the systems annexation, but then these rumors
persist throughout the Consulate. The moon takes its
name from a surrounding "dust cloud" of iron-nickel
fragments suspended by magnetic interaction between it
and Byoen.  These fragments are highly reflective of
sunlight at certain angles, creating spectacular
effects when Particle emerges from the terminator.
<P>
<B>Spertemeir:</B> Small body that is the source of a large
deposit of various heavy elements, particularly
radioactives. Spertemeir, like the Dark Angel, is
probably a collision fragment. Unlike the Angel, it is
definitely local origin, possibly from Elbaz itself. A
small automated mining facility with about seventy
personnel is maintained; like Particle these crews
rotate regularly, and access is limited to ore
freighters and relief ships.
<P>
<B>Dark Angel:</B> The Angel is off-limits to all but
certified and escorted scientific and military
vessels. For the non-scientific, the world is
uninteresting. Its primary attraction is to astro- and
geochemists intent upon analysing gasses trapped
within its fullerene "soil".
<P>
<B>Resonepts:</B> Gas and chemical refineries are located
here that date from before the Collapse. The local
naval station was constructed very close to them to
provide constant surveillance. Unlike the mining
facilities, the workcrews and admin staff are
semi-permanent residents, and have a good working
relationship with the Navy. The only vessels permitted
to land on Resonepts are the twice-monthly mail and
supply shuttles that venture out this far.
<P>
<B>Other naval facilities:</B> All are offlimits save for
naval resupply contractors. Duty on these stations are
the stereotypical "long periods of boredom, punctuated
by moments of sheer terrifying boredom" associated
with static naval stations. Attempts to run the
Quarantine are frequent, usually weekly events, but it
has become repetitive action for the naval crews, who
generally spice up their tours with some extremely
outrageous and downright bizarre entertainment. The
sole exception to this is the station at Hellion,
which sees considerable action in rescuing stupid
smugglers and thrillseekers, and testing new military
and commercial hardware in the Devourer's extreme
environment.
<P><H3>Corporations of Nesturgi</h3><P>

This is a list of significant corporations with
facilities in the Nesturgi (Foreven 2128) system.
Because of the unusual quarantine requirements for all
traffic arriving insystem, a number of corporations
have facilities to handle the break in the flow of
commerce. Other companies cater to the crews and
passengers that flow through the Taj, Nesturgi's
highport. And there are other companies that seek to
exploit Nesturgi's untapped potential, diverting the
flow of money and technology from the Taj for their
own purposes:

<P>
<B>General Products:</B> Manufacture of TL-10 to 12
submersibles and mining platforms in conjunction with
Sternmetal Horizons (Taj). General Products has
steadily improved its product quality, and it has a
fairly good reputation within Foreven. The GP facility
is primarily manufacturing, with little or no
administrative functions. The companies main
headquarters is on Lenin, and a good percentage of its
investment capital originates with either kamrathi or
Akras traders.
<P>
<B>Sternmetal Horizons (ne Horizons in Regency):</B>
Manufacture of TL-10 to 12 submersibles and mining
platforms in conjunction with General Products(Taj).
Minority mining stake and mining supply facilities
(Nesturgi). The local manufacturing facilities are
exempt from the popular perception of the company's
widespread criminality elsewhere in the sector. Avalar
quarantine and legal officials audit the Nesturgi
facilities on an regular basis just to make sure. Most
of Sternmetals resources are tied up in petty trade
wars in the buffer region between the Avalars and the
Zhodani, and Nesturgi rates little attention from
either higher company officials, or its rivals.
<P>
<B>SuSAG:</B> Chemical and mine extraction and refining
plants (Nesturgi). Light pharmaceutical facilities
(Taj/Nesturgi). Another company forced by the
stringent Avalar laws to be above board in its local
dealings. The local plants are mostly low security,
with nothing more important than freely available
commercial goods being produced. However, relations
with the Avalar government are unusually good for a
Regency corp, and rumors abound of preferential
treatment by local quarantine officials. The company
has a very poor relationship with Pro-Regency worlds
in Reidain and Urnian, the result of scandals on
Pylkah and Urnian. And relations with the Kamrathi are
chilly at best.
<P>
<B>Transstar:</B> Maintenance and Rest facility (Taj).
Transstar is a relative newcomer in the former BTC. The
company's antebellum stake in the Domain of Deneb was
minor, and it took the corporate mishaps of Civil War
and the Collapse, and shrewd dealmaking and quickness
to seize upon oppurtunities, to propel the company
into its current prominence. Transtar has always been
a model of corporate good behavior, and its operations
in Foreven are no less exemplary. Its local
maintenance facilities are quite large, and very
efficient; and unusually popular, with frequent repeat
business.
<P>
<B>Ginga Transport:</B> Way and maintenance station (Taj).
Minor administrative hub. Ginga is the exact opposite
of Transtar, with a number of its executives and
operations under investigation at any given time.
Ginga (name is Japanese for "Silver River" i.e. the
Milky Way) is a young shipping and marketing company,
being founded during the latter days of the 1120s.
It's illegal behavior is rooted in its founding
objectivist philosophy, and the company is a zealous
advocate for unrestricted free trade. This attitude
puts it in a head-on course with all Quarantine
restrictions, and it has been a constant thorn in the
sides of authorities everywhere. It steers clear of
known criminal syndicates, and its run-ins have forced
the company to obey the letter, though not the spirit,
of the Quarantine laws. Otherwise the company is
continually challenging the law via loopholes and
clever manuevering. A popular saying in spinward
regions of the Regency puts succinctly: "If Ginga is
just given an inch, it takes a whole parsec." Ginga's
operations are theoretically throughout the Regency,
and is technically its fifth largest shipping company.
In actuality, most of its operations are confined to
the Spinward Marches, particularly along the spinward
and coreward frontiers with the Spinward Hinters and
the Vargr Splinters. Fifty percent of its freight is
interface traffic through the Quarantine to these
regions. The center of its operations is in Vilis and
Querion Subsectors of the Spinward Marches.
<P>
<B>McClellan Factors/Sovereign Lines:</B> Trade station.
Majority mining stake and growing interest in local
real estate and construction businesses. Large
manufacturing position, concentrating on transport
material (Nesturgi). McClellan is not a popular
company no matter where it is located, and its
strongarm acquisition tactics in consolidating the
local mining industry alienated the planetary
government and local popular opinion. The company has
a favored business position with the Consulate,
thereby forestalling major legal action or
intervention. MF is infamous for its hyper-competitive
attitude, and cutthroat tactics. Its relations with
other companies and cartels are never better than
average.
<P>
Sovereign Lines is a wholly owned shipping subsidiary
of the company that now handles nearly all of its
interstellar trading and freight haulage. It is
evidence of MF's competitive nature, for it was
founded after its bitter rival Baraccai Technium
established its subsidiary Leviathan Lines in the
1130s.
<P>
<B>Venturprise:</B> Major competitor with MF. Large stake in
mining and manufacturing operations. Venturprise is
headquartered on Rhylanor, and grew out of an
antebellum company called Spinward Development.
SpinDev was famous for "Buying" undeveloped or lightly
populated worlds within the settled portions of the
Imperial Spinward Marches, and building them into
viable colonies. The Collapse enhanced its business
greatly, thanks to the inflow of refugees from the
Abandonment, and the sudden popularity of
"virus-proof" T-Prime and T-Norm worlds.
<P>
While SpinDev was generally an honest company, its
offspring has been more adventurous, perhaps
piratical. The company was not partial towards opening
up frontier worlds, and the number of worlds that had
the requisite characteristics were limited in number.
This has led Venturprise to target populated backwater
worlds, or potentially profitable worlds that are
below a certain "development threshold" or closed off
to major offworld development for a variety of
reasons. The company's plans are rarely commensurate
with the desires or the culture of the indigenous
population, which creates conflict and the temptation
for subversion beyond even that condoned during the
Imperial period.
<P>
<B>Interglobal:</B> Relative newcomer, and competitor to both
MF and Venturprise. IG is really Arkesh Shipping in a
new guise as a general cartel. The company has strong
ties to the Enterprise, and with pirate bands
operating in Foreven and Beyond.
<P>
<B>Benchmark Arms:</B> A former division of Instellarms, that
seceded as an independent venture after the Great Fire
Sale of 1132. The company concentrates in the small
arms industry, and its careful hands-on management has
allowed it to flourish despite its limited markets.
The local office has a major stake in the local
vintage and collectible arms markets, but has plans to
construct several large weapon factories for Foreven's
large military and starmerc markets.  The Zhodani
Exodus has accelerated its plans drastically, and its
local staff and existing plant are overworked by the
inundation of orders coming from panicky worlds in the
buffer region between Avalar and the Zhodani. Its
deliveries of weapons has been bogged down by the
interference of local Quarantine officials, whose
reasons for doing so are not known in spite of the
emergency.
<P>
<B>Starsenal:</B> Supplier for the Avalar Navy. Bitter rivals
of Benchmark, Wayaroaer and Pentagogue. Another
break-off from Instellarms. Starsenal's name and
products are famous throughout the Regency for quality
and convenience. The company has generous lines of
credit for its clients, and very helpful technical
support for mercenary and planetary military services.
This aggressive marketing gives it a high profile, and
also makes it a magnet for controversy and attack by
its rivals. Starsenal is most famous as a logistical
supplier of munitions, supplies, maintenance services,
support equipment, bulk armor and medical supplies. It
shies away from actual weapons manufacturing,
preferring to create custom integrated systems that
combine components manufactured by other companies
according to the specifications of its clients.
<P>
<B>Octagon Group:</B> Large Avalar financial group with
common ties with several of the aforementioned
companies. The OG has been implicated with the Beyond
Sector criminal syndicate known as the Enterprise, and
Regency and Zhodani authroities have a long list of
Octagon officials under indictment or investigation
for racketeering and money laundering.
<P>
<B>Chiadle:</B> One of the few Zhodani companies permitted to
operate in the Avalar Consulate following the break in
the 1150s. This is mostly due to the company's
successful expansion into Non-Zhodani markets; one of
the few Zhodani companies to do so. Chiadle operations
on Nesturgi are actually secondary to its main
facilities on Lenin; mostly they manufacture
subassemblies and vital parts from locally obtained
resources. Chiadle's operations on Lenin are civilian
transport production plants, and is heavily involved
in the local shipbuilding industry.  Lingering
hostilities involving both the Kamrathi and the
Zhodani brings intense scrutiny from Avalar
authorities, but they have never found anything to
implicate the company (for that matter the Avalars
have never actually found any evidence of major
Kamrathi malfeasance either, in spite of their fears).
Chiadle's management personnel are primarily Zhodani,
to allay suspicion of subversion of locally hired
personnel.
<P>
<B>Wayaroaer:</B> Aslan megacorp, that, like Chiadle above,
flourishes in non-Aslan markets. Nominally under the
control of the Eakhitiyo, in reality the company's
operations are so independent of the main clan council
it could practically get away with murder.  Like
Benchmark (its main local competitor) the company is a
major stakeholder in the local arms industry,
especially custom made guns and blades finished in the
Aslan style.  Since 1181 its main focus has been as a
recruiter and supplier for starmerc groups operating
along the trailing interface of Foreven. Most of these
merc bands have been human organisations, with a few
Aslan and Droyne groups being added to its portfolio
in the last five years. Most of the local management
is a mixture of Aslan and Humans. The relaxed scrutiny
allows the company to hire male "other" Aslan for
management and consulting positions without ruffling
fur back at home.
