Named for an ancient French Solomani writer, Balzac is
heavily industrialised. The world's abundant resources
and strategic location along the Rift Tradeway
attracted large numbers of traders and colonists. The
population soon divided over a number of economic
issues, but not into the usual geographic groupings.
Instead professional and labor groups became the main
competitors, and they chose to divvy up power within
the existing communities. <P>

Rather than being divided by borders, the locals are
barred by "preeminent domain" regulations that
restrict access to a business, housing, utility line
or factory to one of the six federations. Each
federation is a vertically integrated corporation like
structure, that overlaps with its neighbors.
Allegiance is chosen by the pattern of patronisation
by the general population of a federations power
structure. Competitive bargains and deals are offered
by each federation in an attempt to woo citizens; but
the resulting structure muddies allegiances and avoids
quick conflict resolution, which was the point to
begin with. Visitors are recommended to peruse the
general services provided in the starports, as the
thicket that is the local government can be daunting
to the inexperienced.
