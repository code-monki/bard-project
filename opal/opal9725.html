Elysee is a large, lightly populated rock. The
original population hailed from Joyeuse or Besancon,
but the vicious fighting between several Islands
powers has driven most of them offworld, and the
remainder are mostly squatters.  The world is divided
between the forces of Neubayern, New Home and
Serendip, and conflict between them has always been
the nastiest and lest relenting.  Skirmishing between
them and local RPKP forces led to the infamous Mizuha
Affair in 1155. Elysee's orbital B port is of recent,
Regency financed construction, and is offlimits to the
belligerents. The local cities and communities are
ruled by a small but well organised group of
technicians that tirelessly maintain local living
standards despite the interference of offworld
military units.
