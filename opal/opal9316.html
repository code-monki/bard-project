Ukardi is a beautiful T-Norm world possessing only a
small population, a rich biosphere, and many virgin
resources. It is therefore a wonder why this world has
never attracted a population that would fulfill its
potential.
<P>
The reason is Avalaran covetousness. While the world
has never been a part of the Consulate, its richness
has attracted its attention for centuries.  For
various reasons, mostly to do with the conflict
between the Zhodani and the Third Imperium, the
Consulate was never able to claim and exploit the
world for themselves. But they worked damn hard to
insure that no other power or group would claim the
world either.
<P>
In previous centuries, Avalaran naval vessels
vigilantly patrolled the world, driving off
interlopers and pirates with gunfire.  They
established a starport, and restricted all outside
traffic from any other part of the world. Rumors
circulated that the Consulate Navy, in conjunction
with their Zhodani allies, had training bases in the
outback, and their intelligence agencies were emplaced
at the starport for surveillance and inflitration
purposes.
<P>
Since the Collapse, the Consulate has intensified its
presence on the world. Aside from a small community
allowed to settle around the world's civilian
downport, it has constructed a huge array of military
facilities, including barracks, training and logistic
facilities, test and training ranges, military roads,
vehicle parks and C3 facilities in support of the
combined Avalar military. Civilian access to the world
is still restricted to the starport and its
approaches, with trespassers threatened with
indefinite imprisonment or even death.
<P>
This activity is strange, as the Consulate has not
even made any moves to formally annex the world, and
begin preparation for civilian settlement. Regency
Intel originally assessed the world as a exclusively
military reserve, a private possession of the Avalar
military and its personnel for its own aggrandizement.
But the weak position of the military in Consulate
politics has convinced a growing number of analysts
that the bases on the world exist to conceal covert
activity. And given the Consulates unrestrained
attempts to annex Iptete (2334) and Asyrog (2326)
because of suspected Ancient bases, it is strongly
possible that all the activity on Ukardi is also
associated with Final War artifacts, perhaps to a
greater degree than anywhere else.
