Overview: The J-2 Route known variously as the Gold
Road or the Mortal Coil starts at this Regency
Terminus. Consequently, the world is the Five Sisters,
and perhaps the entire Spinward Hinters in microcosm.
While the world has benefited from the increase in
trade and immigration of the post-Collpase period, its
"traditional" culture has been upset by new waves of
social misfits and oppurtunists, new age idealists and
military necessity.
 <P>
<H3>Background</h3>
Mirriam is a young world. It appears as a
stormy, blue ball from space, almost a water world.
Though technically 90 percent water only;  epeiric
seas, shallow bodies of fresh or estaurine water
created by volcanic rifting, obscure about half to
two-thirds of the planets continental crust.
Earthquakes and volcanoes are common on the seafloor,
which discourages deep oceanic colonisation, but
sustains the worlds large mining industry.
 <P>
What remains of dry land are mostly volcanic mountain
arcs and a few raised plateaus created from marine
terranes (submarine volcanos or seafloor dredged up
and uplifted by the moving continents). Most of the
worlds terrestrial life was imported from offworld,
and the mountain arcs support verdant forests of
conifers and mediterranean brushtrees.  Unfortunately,
some of the imported plantlife took an extreme liking
to the world, and the atmospheric taint is a result of
heavy spore and pollen clouds produced as a side
effect of unforeseen evolutionary development in
several species.
 <P>
The oceans are a different matter, with the first
signs of multicellular life beginning to appear within
its still young ecology. Mirriam's diffcult ecology
discouraged most attempts at early colonization.
Coupled with the planets plant spore tainted
atmosphere and frequent tremors associated with
Mirriams large moon, Pam, what colonists that did come
to Mirriam remained within close proximity to the
starport.
 <P>
<H3>History</H3>
Mirriam is one of five worlds named by Ignaz
Ruffleran after after one of his five daughters.
Ruffleran explored the area between 142 and 161
Imperial, eventually settling on Karin/Five Sisters.
Interestingly enough, only one of his daughters,
Ucella, actually took advantage of his claims, and she
settled on Karin to be near her aging father.
 <P>
The first serious colonization came with the
establishment of the Imperial Naval Base in 474,
attracting a small community. A steady trickle of
people, mostly traders and vagabonds coming down the
Spinward Main, settled here over the next three
hundred years. Its proximity to untapped markets in
neighboring sectors, and its location along the
Spinward Main attracted trade, and the combination of
commercial and naval traffic created enough demand for
a B class starport to be built to cater to local
needs.
 <P>
In the 740s, the naval administration began to set
aside large tracts of the world's seafloor for
settlement, and a sizeable amount of investment funds
for aquacultural and infrastructure development. By
800, Mirriam was home to a community of four million
people, a X-Boat Way Station, the headquarters of the
208th Fleet, and there was talk of making it the
permanent subsector capital.  All of this progress was
stillborn in the wake of the Psionic Suppressions.
 <P>
The heightened threat of war with the Zhodani in their
wake froze most development.  The Ministry of
Colonization's benign administration on Mirriam was
replaced with an appointed Naval Legate, who was
usually either the local base commander, or the CO of
208th Fleet. Mirriam's recieved an Amber Zone rating,
as did many other worlds in District 267/Five Sisters,
in the decades that followed.  Ostensibly, the local
Amber rating was for Mirriam's dangerous tidal
conditions, but really it was to serve notice to the
universe that the Third Imperium meant to defend the
world and her sisters against aggression by all means
possible.
 <P>
The navy remains to this day the world's main
administration.  Because of the imposition of military
rule, much of the civilian population became
semi-militarised.  Military police and hired mercs
became the source of law and order. The flow of time
and events, and the boundaries of communities and
their activities became regulated by military base
timetables and perimeters.  The population continued
to grow, because of its existing amenities and
remoteness from the Imperial mainstream.
 <P>
The Imperial Navy's investment into Five Sisters was
quite heavy, and most of it was centered on Mirriam.
In addition to the 208s HQ, a demi-depot was placed on
Mirriam to serve both the Navy and IISS operations
into neighboring sectors.  Trade became even more
important, as an alternative source of income for the
subsector, to alleviate isolation, and to skirt both
the onerous local military regulations and narrow
official policies of armed neutrality that limited
outside contact with the Spinward Hinters.
 <P>
The aftermath of the Fifth Frontier War brought
renewed investment and interest in Mirriam, as victory
increased Imperial clout within the Hinters.  The
generous infrastructure built by the Imperial Navy was
attractive to many outside and local investors as a
foundation for increased economic trade and industry.
A number of development banks and investment funds
were centered here, and there was an upsurge in
colonization.
 <P>
The breakout of the Imperial Civil War had the
paradoxical effect of intensifying this interest. The
loss of Imperial markets had little negative effect
upon Five Sisters, as did the Aslan advances.  Instead
it caused a massive upswing in commercial and military
investment as the Domain of Deneb reached out into
Foreven and Beyond Sectors, looking for new allies and
seeking to make up for lost markets.  This investment
created a mountain of wealth on Mirriam, and the
beginnings of a new class of wealthy families known
simply as "Hortalez".
 <P>
On the eve of the Collapse, Mirriam had all the
required attributtes for an economic takeoff: an
accumulation of money, a skilled workforce, stable
markets, well developed infrastructure and extensive
trade and logistical networks.  The Quarantine
dampened the world's prospects for about five years,
until Norris passed the edict that relaxed Quarantine
regulations into Five Sisters.  After that, Mirriam
blossomed into a major trade and political center.
 <P>
<H3>Quarantine</H3>
Travellers into the Mirriam system come
out of jump space at the trailing trojan of Tiffany,
the systems second largest gas giant.  All incoming
vessels are hailed by RQS immediately, and are
directed to one of five nearby inspection bases.  At
these bases ships are swarmed over by legions of
inspectors, who search the ships stem to stern.  But
because of the unusually large numbers of inspectors,
inspections and certification usually takes only about
two or three hours.
 <P>
Regency ships that have inspection certificates from
other inspection stations in Five Sisters are even
luckier: inspectors only check the vessels freight and
navigation logs, do a cursory inspection of cargo, and
usually let a ship go after only forty five minutes to
an hour, sometimes less. Despite the cursoriness of
these inspections, they are probably closer to the
Regency's current reality than the excessive (and
eroding) scrutiny back safeside.
 <P>
This relaxation of inspection standards is political,
economic and pragmatic. Because Mirriam isn't an
interface port, most of this activity is primarily
done to log incoming cargoes from the Hinters, and to
deter smuggling around the Quarantine, rather than any
pretension of anti-Virus deterrence.
 <P>
<H3>Geography</H3>
Most of Mirriams settlements are
underwater, or at least semi-submerged.  The scarcity
of land and the violent seismic activity of the
planets volcanic arcs limit terrestrial habitation.
Most of its islands are preserved as nature parks, or
for limited dry land farming. Most of the worlds
communities are located in the Bermuda Sea, a large
epieric sea the the size of the Gulf of Mexico and
Caribbean combined.  The worlds original industries
were in seafloor mining, aquaculture and support of
the naval base, but has expanded in heavy and light
manufacturing, thanks to money from the Industrial
Development Program.
 <P>
In addition to Bermuda, there are large concentrations
of settlements in the Glomar Deep, Casbah Sea and the
Breathless Lagoon. Most mining is done in the northern
Helmuth Basin, and the naval base is located on
Compass Island within the Casbah Sea. These areas are
divided from each other by the Panthalassan Sea, a
deep, still mostly unsurveyed body of water.  Most
underwater cities are specially sheltered and
reinforced for protection against the planet's deadly
tidal bores.
 <P>
The sprawling downport of Diriishigan City is the
exception. Located on an old marine terrane that is
seismically stable. Diriishigan is also the worlds
main business center, the core of "Hortalez" and the
pivott of the Rand and its trade routes.
 <P>
The city is an outgrowth of the extrality zone, and it
and the port covers an area of almost seven hundred
square kilometers. It is a crazy quilt of offices,
cavernous warehouses, and a skyline that rivals Mora.
Construction is frequent and furious, a reflection of
its transient population and oscillating fortunes.  It
is fairly lawless, and is filled with minor fortune
seekers, oppurtunists and predators. Self-described as
the City that Never Sleeps, which is an accurate
assessment of its frenetic night life.  When
offworlders think of the Rand, it is Diriishigan that
comes to their minds.
 <P>
Everything and anything that can be sold, can be found
in its sprawling markets and trade yards. Compared to
the rest of the world, the city is a lawless island in
of itself.  Organised crime, prostitution and
contraband peddling are endemic, as are the throngs of
mercenaries, parasites and "gutter-tourists" attracted
to its seedy bars, casinos and redlight district.
Displaced minor nobles often come here looking for
either one last binge of pleasure, or looking to find
a niche for survival.
 <P>
At the top of the food chain, populating no niche
other than its own, are the worlds upper class, the
Hortalez. The group originated in the former megacorps
subsector administrative branch, using purloined
corporate assets, and the old money associations of
many upper managers, as seed capital for successful
business ventures. This group is a cloud island held
aloft by its snobbish elevation above the other
fueding groups, and the mere entrepenuers populating
the streets below. Most Hortalez are second or third
generation, old money by local standards.  They're
rather unimpressive by safeside comparisons, but they
dominate the subsectors markets, even holding their
own against the former megacorps. Most of them live in
the city, though many have estates in the countryside,
or in a tony suburb known as Shining Hill, about 50
kms outside the city.
 <P>
But the city is physically and culturally distanced
from Mirriam's mainstream society.  Its underwater
culture is still heavily impressed with military
discipline, and naturally disdains the Hortalez crowd.
The "Reals" as they call themselves, would have you
believe that they are a sober, hardworking lot.  But
in fact these people are the descendants of earlier
waves of colonists who came to Mirriam seeking much
the same kind of easy fortune, only to be displaced by
later post-Collapse waves of immigrants.  Most of the
social tension is a mixture of jealousy at both the
upstarts who make it big, and the self-interested old
money that seeds the planets conversion into a slum.
 <P>
Between these two groups are various eco-groups,
offshoots of the NEO (Navigators of the Endless Ocean)
that colonised Lothorien (140), Galadriel (239) and
Prince Edward (734). These groups keep to themselves,
and sustain their communities on alternative
agriculture, aquaculture and quite a bit of their
ethereal romantic ideology.
 <P>
<H3>Features</H3>
Mirriam is the business center of Five
Sisters. Despite the seedier elements that populate
storefront offices, its dominant business class is
powerful, sober and controlling. Most of the worlds
upscale business is done in the Mosaic district of
Diriishigan, a huge self-contained city within the
city sheltered in a huge cathedral-like arcology about
10 km from the starport. Only the business elite live
and work here, and it is a mark of hard-earned sucess
and prestige to be invited by the worlds Senior
Commercial Council, the buildings owner and manager,
to live here. Visitation into the Mosaic are by
invitation only, subject to the SCCs approval.
 <P>
Mirriam's naval base remains an oversized
transitional facility.  Too big to be a mere base, and
too small to be a depot, with no announced plans to
alter the status quo.  The base is tightly secured
against outside intrusion, and base security is
butressed by private security patrols and police in
local communities.  Despite this, the navy's need for
intelligence and private operators in the subsector
and the Spinward Approaches (Reidain and
Urnian/Foreven L and P; Menorial subsector in Trojan
Reach) makes it a heavy employer of private military
contractors.  Most hiring is done at a subsidiary
facility in the Diriishigan downport, but most are
stationed out of the base.  The mix of private merc
and Regency mil personnel is a volatile one, and local
mps are especially vindictive towards the former.
