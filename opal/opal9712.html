New Home was the first Islands world to be colonised
by the ESA Long Range Mission, in -9. The colonists
found it to be hot and humid, but otherwise very
amenable to human habitation.  The colonists scattered
into small communities across the surface of the
world, eschewing any government beyond a mutual aid
alliance.  Because of the natural bounty of its farms
and fisheries, New Home enjoyed an easier time
developing and higher standards of living.  Prosperity
and the attendant increase in spare time meant that
more attention could be diverted into scientific
research and technological development.  While the
locals never developed an inkling of jump science,
they were already at TL-11 when Serendip came calling
with its fleet of starships around 993.
<P>
The brief takeover by Serendip had immeasurable
consequences that went unnoticed at the time. New
Home's people had such an easy time of it compared to
the other colony worlds, whether by accident or
deliberate design, that they had become convinced that
their world truly was paradise. But a grubby bunch of
belters with a dubious entrepenuerial bent punctured
that supercilious air of supremacy, and New Home's
inhabitants never forgave that transgression.  The
easygoing pastoralism gave way to a paradise lost
syndrome that drove New Home to manically seek
technical and military superiority over its neighbors
and rivals. When Serendip and Neubayern went to war
over Topas in 1106, New Home lashed out at both forces
with its powerful fleet, and the localised
confrontation spread into a general war.
<P>
New Home's forces enjoyed a reputation for
ruthlessness second only to its cobelligerents on New
Colchis, and its technologically superior forces
pushed everyone around.  But then it made the mistake
of intervening in a civil war on nearby Colchis; the
overdeployment of resources and troops to contain the
local insurgency allowed its enemies to regain the
initiative, and wear down its forces through
attrition.  New Home has lost its technological and
economic lead through Neubayernian and Joyeusean
commerce raids and planetary strikes, and it has had
to consolidate its forces to defend Colchis and the
mainworld against terrorist and guerilla attacks.
Nonetheless its forces remain dangerously
overstretched on several battlefronts, and the
increasing dominance of its military in the planetary
government has undermined alternatives, such as the
current Four Power Talks. New Home is considered to be
the main long term threat to the restoration of peace
in the region; and perversely a good friend of the
local RQS command for its intransigence.
