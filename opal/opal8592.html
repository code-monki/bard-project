Bishop was originally settled by firms from Dekha
searching for a safe world to conduct experimentation
and research too dangerous to conduct on the more
heavily settled homeworld. Until 1083, Bishop was a
colony of Dekha, and they remain closely tied by trade
and common culture.  The local population is scattered
in a number of small settlements, and are generally
insular or too engaged in their work to frequently
travel or meet offworlders.  Most relationships on the
world are pragmatic or business oriented, and the most
basic social interaction between the locals and
visitors are generally conducted in a manner more akin
to business dealings.
