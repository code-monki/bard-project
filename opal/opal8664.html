The main world in the Spinward Complex, Maricutin is a
restricted testing center. The Imperial Navy used it
to test new ships, marine equipment and the latest
orbit-to-surface weaponry, and it continues in this
role in the Regency. Most of Maricutin's surface is
offlimits to civilian personnel, and are confined to
the downport grounds. Because of the local living
arrangements, the world officially has a population of
zero, as no seperate world government exists beyond
the naval administration, which does not bother to
administer a free-fire zone.
<P>
Traditionally a small number of citizens live in
specially equipped shelters just outside of what was
the starport extrality zone. These ambassadors permit
a small nominal population, enough for political
representation within Regency governing bodies. In the
past these facilities were also used as prisons or
quarantine facilities as well, and the navy has often
used them for a variety of reasons in the past. The
current ambassadors are two married couples, one human
and one Aslan, but the latter are listed in the UPP as
being A:4 (2.4 Humans and 1.6 Aslan) a practical joke
meant to send up the dry, unquestioning manner of
Regency bureaucrats. The locals are known for their
excessive sense of humor, and practical jokes are a
refined artform and part of the local culture.
