<H1>UWP Update  </H1>

<HR>
<P>

This is an interpretive update of UWP data in RSB.
This is chiefly to explain changes in data that
occured between 1117 and 1202. This section covers the
coreward portion of the Regency Spinward Marches.
Specifically Regency worlds in Jewell, Regina, Aramis,
Vilis, Lanth and Rhylanor Subsectors.
<P>
This data has been confined to the Regency in light of
the major impact of major events like the Abandonment,
Fait Accompli and the Representational Reforms. The
format goes by subsector, broken down into individual
world entries, which are further divided by 1117 and
1202 UPP data, followed by brief comments on the
reason or mechanism of change, and in some cases a
brief explanation for its current conditions.
<P>
Much of this data comes from <cite>GURP Traveller's Behind the Claw</cite>
sourcebook. My thanks to our dear Martin Dougherty for
clarification and his helpful comments regarding that
book. All of this data, he assures me, is congruent
with <cite>Regency Sourcebook</cite>, and can be used with little
modification.

<h3>Jewell Subsector</h3>

<B>Subsector Notes:</B> The Regency portion of Jewell is part
of the old Spinward Frontier, a region typified by
strong conservatism, sharp patriotism, and a strongly
engrained loyalty to established authority. Unlike
Regina Subsector, Jewell suffered a handful of
government changes, but none of them were due to the
Representational Reforms.
<P>
<B>Population (1117/1202):</B> 18.0 Billion/30.4 Billion
<BR><B>Industrial Worlds:</B> 2
<BR><B>Mean Tech Level(1117/1202):</B> 9.5/11.2
<BR><B>Senate Contingent:</B> 62
<P>

<h4>Esalin</h4>       </h4><B>1117:</B></B> C565673-8
        <BR><B>1202:</B> B565866-A         GA
<P>
Esalin's Imperial and Zhodani cultural
enclaves were united under Regency military control in
1150. The world has a very visible psionic presence,
albeit under heavy military supervision.
<P>
<h4>Lysen        </h4><B>1117:</B> B592655-A
       <BR><B>1202:</B> B592677-B         **
<P>
Lysen's technocratic government collapsed amidest a
series of major bribery scandals in the 1170s. Several
communities seceded, and formed seperate nations. The
world's downport is itself a sovereign nation, albeit
non-aligned with any major factions.
<P>
<h4>Louzy        </h4><B>1117:</B> D322A88-8
      <BR><B>1202:</B> C322A78-A         **
<P>
Louzy's government broke apart in 1148 after a dispute
over mining claims led to a brief flare up of "tribal
warfare" between the militia's of two seperate
settlements. The world government's response to the
crisis was slow and inept, and several other
communities joined the two contending factions. A
three way division currently prevails, though one of
these factions is showing signs of further devolution.
<P>
<h3>Regina Subsector:</h3>
<P>
<B>Subsector Notes:</B> Regina has enjoyed exactly zero
government changes. Which is not suprising given its
location and history. Strongly patriotic to begin
with, several of the subsector's worlds have become
absolutely insufferable since Norris first became
Regent. Regina currently possesses the largest number
of industrial worlds of any subsector, and may gain
three more (Wochiers, Alell and Feri) in the next
century. And thanks to its unusual population
distribution, it also possesses the largest Senate
contingent of any subsector, a fact that adds further
insult to injury to subsectors already impatient with
Regina's overstuffed sense of importance. In
retaliation, other regions seize upon its backward
tech levels, snidely comparing it to the three point
advantage of it's "rural" neighbor, Aramis subsector.
This has led to the derogatory moniker "ploughboy"
referring to native Reginans.
<P>
<B>Population (1117/1202):</B>  63.7 Billion/69.0 Billion.
(doesn't include Algine/Regina)
<BR><B>Industrial Worlds:</B> 7 (8 if Algine is counted)
<BR><B>Mean Tech Level(1117/1202):</B> 8.3/8.9
<BR><B>Senate Contingent:</B> 205
<P>
<h3>Aramis Subsector:</h3>
<P>
<B>Subsector Notes:</B> Aramis suffered from large incursions
of Vargr Corsairs during the Civil War. The Domain of
Deneb had been making some progress in rooting out
these freebooters, when the Collapse made it moot. As
such the subsector has more than its share of Fait
Accompli worlds. Without the FA, Aramis shares the
same degree of political continuity as other Spinward
Frontier subsectors. Only three worlds enjoyed
government changes otherwise, and two of these were
for external reasons. Junidy is the sole exception,
and is due to the prevailing victory of the Llewyoelly
minor race in a referendum in 1159.
<P>
<B>Population(1117/1202):</B>32.7 Billion/ 44.0 Billion
<BR><B>Industrial Worlds:</B> 3
<BR><B>Mean Tech Level(1117/1202):</B> 8.7/12.4
<BR><B>Senate Contingent:</B> 132
<P>
<h4>Paya         </h4><B>1117:</B> A655241-9
       <BR><B>1202:</B> A655333-B         **
<P>
Paya was reclassified by the Ministry of Interior to
better reflect the reality of its society.
<P>
<h4>Corfu        </h4><B>1117:</B> X895674-8
       <BR><B>1202:</B> E895552-5         **
<P>
During the antebellum period, Corfu's population was
stricken with a virulent pathogen known as the Corfu
Claw Virus. While not possessing a high lethality
rate, the disease was quite debilitating to its
sufferers, and the Scout Service interdicted the world
to prevent offworld transmission.  In 1117, researches
at the University of Rhylanor developed a vaccine, and
the interdiction was raised to amber in 1119. Of
course that was the year that the Vargr first invaded
Aramis, and the world lost considerable population to
evacuation. The world is still an Amber Zone, as
offworld visitors must still be vaccinated against the
virus.
<P>
<h4>Violante     </h4><B>1117:</B> C669452-A
       <BR><B>1202:</B> C6697A5-A         FA
<P>
Violante was invaded by Kforuzeng allied forces in
1119, and these were still present when the world was
declared Fait Accompli in 1132. The ruling human
nobles cut a deal with the corsairs that created a
joint power structure. The conflict caused the
abandonment of several estates, and these were sold to
human and Vargr refugees fleeing Virus. In recent
years, these new immigrants have chafed against the
governments tight controls over economic development,
and guerilla fighting has erupted in certain regions,
prompting Regency intervention. The divisions on the
world are primarily class oriented, with poorer
immigrant Vargr and Humans allied against the joint
Human/Vargr power structure.
<P>
<h4>Jesedipere:  </h4><B>1117:</B> C775300-7
      <BR><B>1202:</B> B7756A5-8         FA
<P>
Jesedipere was the sight of bitter Domain-Vargr
fighting during the Civil War. In the aftermath of the
Collapse, a large influx of Vargr refugees settled the
the otherwise empty world.
<P>
<h4>Aramanx      </h4><B>1117:</B> B657974-6
       <BR><B>1202:</B> B65799B-A         **
<P>
Aramanx was a source of bitter contention between
antebellum period megacorps Ling Standard and
Sternmetal. Each company backed a particular faction
that then proceeded to wage a civil war in the period
immediately before the beginning of the Fifth Frontier
War.  The conflict was temporarily postponed by the
Zhodani, and then again by Vargr invasions of 1118-19,
but resumed in 1122. The Collapse saw the megacorps
withdraw their support, and the previously Ling
Standard backed nation of Lanax seized the initiative
and overwhelm its opposition. Aramanx was originally
settled by pacifists from Deneb sector, and the world
has reverted back to its original plan; weapons of any
kind are banned from the surface.
<P>
<h4>Rugbird      </h4><B>1117:</B> BAC5634-A
       <BR><B>1202:</B> BAC5789-B         FA
<P>
Rugbird was occupied by Kforuzeng forces during the
Civil War. This caused a major portion of the human
population to flee safeside, and the corsairs moved a
large number of dependents and support personnel into
the vacated orbital habitats. The corsairs suffered a
major defeat in 1124, and the system was retaken by
Domain naval forces. The now stranded Vargr were
permitted to remain in their adopted homes, and began
to take an active role in their new community.
<P>
<h4>Junidy       </h4><B>1117:</B> B434ABD-9
       <BR><B>1202:</B> A434AEE-D         RR
<P>
Junidy is home to the Llellewyoly minor race,
otherwise known as the Dandies or Dandelions. In
antebellum times, their homeworld was dominated by a
succession of governments formed by the minority human
population.  Nearly all of these discriminated against
the Llellewyoly, restricting their freedoms, and
relegating them to second class status. In the period
between the last two Frontier Wars, an armed
resistance movement composed of Llellewyoly radicals
and some sympathetic humans waged a low level guerilla
and sabotage war against the most recent government, a
conflict that carried over into the Civil War period.
Vargr corsairs assisted the guerillas, but were unable
to dislodge the junta. In the aftermath of the
Collapse, the conflict cooled down to a simmer, as the
world's location on the border with the Vargr
Splinters, and its inclusion in the Industrial
Development Program took attention away the issue. The
IDP, with its equal oppurtunity clauses, unwittingly
undid the junta's authority, and a majority of the
human population sided with Llellewyoly moderates
during the Representational Reform referendum. The
strict government that now rules Junidy is a dual
structure: a religious autocracy for the indigenous
population, and a civil service bureaucracy for the
human population.
<P>
(One further note: Junidy is the first Spinward
Marches world to finally exceed the limits of the old
CT world generation system.)
<P>
<h4>Natoko       </h4><B>1117:</B> B582211-8
      <BR><B>1202:</B> B582468-A         **
<P>
Natoko was originally a corporate fief of Tukera
Lines, which maintained it as its primary maintenance
and refit center in the subsector. The bankruptcy of
Tukera following the Collapse caused it to be seized
by one of the company's chief surviving shareholders,
in this case the Marquis of Aramis. Despite the
Repesentational Reforms, the Marquis seat is still in
existence, and the current holder still maintains the
world as his property. But with the demise of Tukera,
the Marquis was forced to open up the world to other
outside development. The old Tukera facility has been
expanded and opened to outside traffic, and the world
has become an important connector for trade moving to
the Vargr Splinters from Rhylanor and Sabine
subsectors.
<P>
<h3>Vilis Subsector:</h3>

<B>Subsector Notes:</B> Vilis has enjoyed a number of major
changes since the Collapse, in spite of its position
in the Spinward Frontier. This is mostly due to the
independence of Tanoose, and the jockeying that
occured between the Regency and the Federation of
Arden in the period immediately after the imposition
of the Quarantine.  Vilis is still a remote backwater
subsector compared to old Imperial norm, but it has
attracted a considerable amount of trade with Foreven
and the region around the Zhodani frontier.
<P>
<B>Population(1117/1202):</B>9.8 Billion/ 16.7 Billion
<BR><B>Industrial Worlds:</B> 3
<BR><B>Mean Tech Level(1117/1202):</B> 9.7/10.7
<BR><B>Senate Contingent:</B> 118
<P>
<h4>Choleosti    </h4><B>1117:</B> C200100-9
       <BR><B>1202:</B> B200322-A         CD
<P>
Another world to benefit from trade through the Four
Corners region. Choleosti was a popular stopover point
for Zhodani merchants travelling through Querion.
While this trade was minor, it did attract a small
population that catered to this rare instance of
cultural exchange.
<P>
<h4>Margesi      </h4><B>1117:</B> C575677-6
      <BR><B>1202:</B> C575787-7         **
<P>
Margesi was originally divided between two feuding
governments. Sword World invasion forces attempted to
seize the world during the Landgrab of 1132, and were
able to seize a large foothold in the no man's land
between the two states.  While Regency forces
eventually dispatched the encroachers, the two
governments and their populations were mortified by
their own inability during the crisis. The two
governments pooled their resources into a combined
starport authority, and unitary military. These
combined efforts were rewarded by the revenue
generated as more and more ships used the Four Corners
interface for trade to spinward. The starport
authority's responsibility was progressively expanded
to the entire planet, and became the main government
in 1173.
<P>
<h4>Tanoose      </h4><B>1117:</B> B978868-A
       <BR><B>1202:</B> A978987-B         RR
<P>
Tanoose is previously described in Regency Sourcebook.
<P>
<h4>Edna         </h4><B>1117:</B> E400220-5
      <BR><B>1202:</B> E400220-9         GA
<P>
Formerly known as Edinina. In the wake of the
Federation of Arden's refusal to sign the Spinward
Accords, the Regency was compelled to annex several
worlds in Vilis subsector to fortify its frontier.
Edna is a boring world with few reasons to visit,
though the scouts and the military often use its local
gas giant, Laughable, for manuevers and training.
<P>
<h4>Port Anselm  </h4><B>1117:</B> D955000-2
       <BR><B>1202:</B> C955300-8         CD
<P>
Formerly known as 728-907.  The world was claimed by
the Third Imperium to forestall annexation by other
powers, namely the Federation of Arden.
<P>
<h4>Arkadia      </h4><B>1117:</B> E446845-6
      <BR><B>1202:</B> C4469BC-9         **
<P>
Arkadia was plagued by an inefficient democratic
government that spent as much of its time debating
minor issues of parliamentary procedure as it did
governing. In 1138, the planetary military staged a
coup against the planetary assembly, and installed a
junta in its place. While initially unpopular, the new
government was much more efficient, and even attracted
a number of offworld manufacturing concerns. The
subsequent prosperity and increase in population has
allayed resistance, and the junta survived the
Representational Reforms relatively intact.
<P>
<h4>Tremous Dex  </h4><B>1117:</B> B511411-C
       <BR><B>1202:</B> B511557-C         GA
<P>
Anger at Arden's recalcitrance instigated the Regency
takeover of this world in 1132. The corporate
government of Tremous Dex had been increasingly at
loggerheads with the Federation, and declared its
allegiance to the Regency after secret negotiations
with the Foriegn Ministry.  Relations between this
world and its former neighborss are very chilly, and
ships registered from this world are barred from the
Federation.
<P>
<h4>Mirriam      </h4><B>1117:</B> E472300-8
      <BR><B>1202:</B> D472464-8         GA
<P>
Disease-ridden Mirriam was placed under military
control after the Quarantine. The system's naval base
had been a strategically important facility during the
Frontier Wars, and the Regency wanted to prevent the
installment of Arden associated terrorists and rabble
rousers within the population.  The world is not a
popular duty station for naval personnel.
<P>
<h4>Asgard       </h4><B>1117:</B> X3437C7-2
      <BR><B>1202:</B> E3437C7-4         **
<P>
Asgard was supposedly interdicted by the Third
Imperium to protect its primitive human culture from
offworld contact. In reality it was a regressed Sword
World colony interdicted at the behest of a number of
Imperial commercial interests looking to exploit the
low tech labor pool for its own purposes. If Asgard
was really interdicted, skeptical parties were often
wont to ask in the Antebellum period, then why were a
sizeable amount of its handmade textiles and
implements available, at exorbitant prices, in the
most exclusive stores of the Domain?  The Regency
government ended the world's interdiction in the
1130s, and has slowly uplifted the local culture into
the interstellar mainstream. Asgardians are very
contented with their place in the universe, in direct
contrast to their Sword World brethren.
<P>
<h4>Tavonni      </h4><B>1117:</B> B567000-7
       <BR><B>1202:</B> B567642-D         CD
<P>
Tavonni was opened to colonial development in the
early years of the Civil War. The world was the sight
of major fighting with Sword World guerillas in 1132.
<P>
<h4>Phlume       </h4><B>1117:</B> C887624-8
       <BR><B>1202:</B> C887645-8         RR
<P>
Phlume's government change was instigated by immigrant
merchants fed up with their indigenous neighbors
dilatory attitudes towards offworld contact. These
merchants used a slyly worded referendum that divested
the previous government's power into a handpicked
assembly of their cronies. The local population has
taken severe umbrage at this trickery, and a low level
war of sabotage and intimidation has taken root.
<P>
<h3>Lanth Subsector:</h3>
<B>Subsector Notes:</B>Lanth lies in the transition zones of
several regions: the Old Frontier to spin and
coreward, the Midway in trailing, and the Regency Hub
to rim. Lanth remains a backwater, though at least a
couple of its worlds, Treece and Equus, will attain
high population status sometime in the next century
<P>
<B>Population (1117/1202):</B>  0.9 Billion/ 1.6 Billion
<BR><B>Industrial Worlds:</B> 0
Mean Tech Level (1117/1202): 8.8/9.7

<P>
<h4>Ghandi       </h4><B>1117:</B> B211455-A
       <BR><B>1202:</B> A211560-C         GA
<P>
The original government was replaced by a new naval
administration after the relocation of the 88th Fleet.
The local populace revolted against this loss of
autonomy in 1134, and the navy ever since has been
content with leaving the civilian populace unmolested.
The startown is heavily patrolled by naval shore
police, but they are only empowered with arresting
offduty service personnel. All legal enforcement
ulitmately ends up with the local (and overworked) MoJ
office.
<P>
<h4>Ylaven       </h4><B>1117:</B> X587552-4
       <BR><B>1202:</B> D587646-6         **
<P>
Ylaven was colonised by an old Solomani STL mission
sometime in the Long Night. When first discovered by
IISS, the population had regressed to pre-industrial
levels, and the world was interdicted. Despite slow
scientific progress, the locals managed to finally
reach TL-5 in 1150, and RISS successfully contacted
them in 1154. Despite severe cultural gaps with their
neighbors, the Ylavenites have slowly adjusted, in
large part aided by their remote location. The world's
economy is dominated by farms that provide food
products for naval bases on nearby Ghandi and
D'Ganzio.
<P>
<h4>Wypoc        </h4><B>1117:</B> E9C4547-8
      <BR><B>1202:</B> E9C4687-9         RR
<P>
When the Regency undertook the Psionic Reforms, it had
to declassify its research facility on Wypoc. The new
government code reflects a change made in 1186, in the
wake of growing demands on local infrastructure made
by the population.
<P>
<h4>Treece       </h4><B>1117:</B> D232866-8
       <BR><B>1202:</B> D2328A6-8         RR
<P>
This poverty stricken world was most notable for its
export of gallowglass troops for use by interested
factions in the Imperial government, or by anyone that
could afford their services. When the market for mercs
imploded in the Post-Collapse period, the world
subsisted upon remittances sent home by the large
Treecian contingent in the military and Quarantine
Service. The world gained its independence in 1162,
percieving that Inthe was stealing a good portion of
this money for its own use.
<P>
<h4>Echiste      </h4><B>1117:</B> C53A313-A
       <BR><B>1202:</B> C53A434-A         **
<P>
A Rule of Man colony. Echiste was recontacted by the
IISS in 909, and slowly opened to development. This
was complicated by the emigration of most of the
original population to other nearby worlds, leaving
only a small group to salvage the place. The Echiste
corporation managed to attract mining development, and
the current government is composed of the company's
leadership.
<P>
<h4>Rhise        </h4><B>1117:</B> C100576-A
      <BR><B>1202:</B> C100644-9         RR
<P>
Rhise had been long divided between warring factions
intent on monopolising the world's scarce water
resources. An especially nasty world war in the 1080s
nearly included the use of weapons of mass
destruction, and that trip to the brink of extinction
was an epiphany for the locals.  Over the course of
the 12th century, the feuding governments have
devolved their power to a new planetary council with
complete authority over the military and the badly
needed water.

<P>
<h4>La'Belle     </h4><B>1117:</B> C564112-4
       <BR><B>1202:</B> C564223-6          CD
<P>
La'Belle was owned by Spinward Development, which
abandoned the world in 1130, selling their claim to
interested colonists from Skull/Lanth (SM 2418). The
world's cold climate has prevented wider development.
<P>
<h4>Icetina      </h4><B>1117:</B> B5245A9-7
       <BR><B>1202:</B> B5245C8-9         GA
<P>
Icetina's severely disfunctional junta attracted
Domain Marine intervention in 1125. After a quick if
bloody battle, the junta was liquidated, and was
replaced with a more amenable council of loyal Domain
lackeys. Another coup dislodged this corrupt bunch in
1133, and a new popular council has been in power ever
since.
<P>
<h4>Cogri        </h4><B>1117:</B> CA6A643-9
       <BR><B>1202:</B> CA6A654-9         **
<P>
Ice covered Cogri disestablished its representational
government shortly after the Collapse in an effort to
attract more trade.
<P>
<h3>Rhylanor Subsector</h3>
<B>Subsector Notes:</B>The terminus of the old Imperial
trade route, running from Vland, now known as the
Midway. Suprisingly, Rhylanor had a number of
undeveloped worlds, as a result of industrial
dominance. A number of these worlds have been opened
to new commercial development since the Collapse.
<P>
<B>Population(1117/1202):</B>36.5 Billion/ 54.7 Billion
<BR><B>Industrial Worlds:</B> 5

       <BR><B>1202:</B> C483454-9         CD
<P>
This strange world was opened up to colonisation in
the late 1130s. Settlements are primarily scattered
ranches and truck farms.
<P>
<h4>Pannet       </h4><B>1117:</B> E9C5677-7
       <BR><B>1202:</B> D9C5577-7         **
<P>
Pannet was once divided between three different
groups: one corporate, one governmental (Imperial
Ministry of Colonialisation) and a group of accidental
colonists stranded here some five hundred years ago.
The corporate colonists frequently waged war with
their neighbors over resources, but were sent packing
after their Core based bosses were exterminated by

Fulacin was originally settled as a forward supply
base by Zhodani Tozjabr agents that had infiltrated
the Imperial corp Magnetodynamics (see Adventure 3:
Twilight's Peak). The enclave was liquidated by
Imperial forces in 1105, and the surviving facilities
were sold to Spinward Development Corp.. The company
in turn sold mining rights to several offworld
concerns, and the planet is divided between a dozen or
so corporate enclaves clustered around the old
downport (which is still known as "Uncle Joe's
Folly").

Owned by Spinward Development. The world has been slow
to develop, despite its amenable nature, owing to a
longstanding bureaucratic dispute internal to the
company, and the usual difficulty of opening up a
water world to outside development.

Valhalla was the result of some demented sense of
humor. Its original culture was modelled upon ancient
Norse society, down to its nordic nobility and Viking
traditions. Of course such a contrived government
didn't really work. Immigration by Abandonment
refugees tilted the balance of power in favor of the
increasingly disaffected populace, and a referendum
changed the government in 1165.

<P>
Nutema was purchased by Spinward Development in 1103.
Unlike Loneseda, Nutema has been an unqualified
success. The current community has been in existence
since 1140.

This lightly populated world attracted a sizeable
population in the wake of the Abandonment.
