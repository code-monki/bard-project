Also known as "Whip-Whack." Wepwaci was settled in the
late 500s to exploit its mixture of agro and mineral
resources. The world is modestly habitable, thanks to
a significant amount of chlorine and hydrogen sulfide
taint created by a number of local biological agents.
This gas mix is strong enough to require full
protective gear, especially during the winter.
<P>
The world attained industrial status only since the
Collapse. Most of its growth has come through the same
source as the rest of the Avalar Corridor: emigration
of Regency citizens fearful of Virus, and/or unhappy
with the Regency's post-Collapse liberalisation. Most
of Wepwaci's emigrants were wealthy property owners
rather than middle-class professionals, nevertheless
they've financied a steady advancement of the world's
TL, and its industries are heavily concentrated in
bulk and materials manufacturing, component
fabrication and metal and plastic finishing
industries.
<P>
The world's government is a direct outgrowth of
Avalar's corporate state, and is fairly insular and
repressive on its own. Tensions between the government
and the new middle class are more in evidence than
anywhere else in the Avalar Corridor, though not to
the point of violence or war. The world's proles are
becoming more divided between the traditional public
corps and the new private companies that are leading
Wepwaci's economic transformation, and this has lead
to tensions between upwardly mobile groups and the
traditional labor and vocational groups.
<P>
These tensions are kept at a low simmer thanks to the
world's reputation for egalitarianism, or it should be
said, its imposition of equality.  For Wepwaci is home
to a peculiar group of fungi known variously as
"Spider-Weps" or "Wep-Lashes." Similar to Terran
Ringworm, these are harmless, topical parasites that
create weblike networks of brightly colored markings
on the skin.  Most species are attracted to the areas
under the ears, the back of the scalp, neck, upper
torso and armpits. While the designs of these webs are
often intricate, they are rarely flattering or
beautiful, and their ugliness is enhanced by their
phosphoresence thanks to the higher ultraviolet output
of Wepwaci's primary.
<P>
There is no cure for Spider-Wep, and nearly the entire
population has one form of it or another.  This
reduces everyone to the same aesthetic level, rich or
poor, as the markings are impossible to cover up, and
permanent as long as a person remains on Wepwaci.
Status then is irrelevant, and ostentation ridiculous.
The similarities between the elite and the common man
goes very far in defusing conflict, as their is no
room for sanctimonious pride in this society.  As
such, no divisions exist, at least in public between
the different social strata, and people usually become
more important for their accomplishments, rather than
their accumulated wealth.
