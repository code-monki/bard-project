Like its neighbor, Ushashin is also a water world
orbiting a large gas giant. But unlike Third Mu,
Ushashin is a much younger world, about a billion
years in age. The eleventh moon of the gas giant
Bodyanovsky, it has a normal rotation and orbital
period, but it is pelted on a regular basis by
planetismals that are still in abundance throughout
the system. Most of these bodies are rather small, and
pose little threat to the settlements that exist on
the system. But they have also discouraged more
settlement beyond a few mining camps operated by
Sternmetal, which seems to prefer it that way.
<P>
The low O2 content in the atmosphere allows for more
dissolved metals to exist in solution in the
world-ocean, and much mining is done through solute
concentration of seawater near undersea vents and
rifts. The high sulfur and metal content of local
seawater discourages the development of multicellular
life, and the paucity of anything more developed than
algae creates the impression of dead seas. O2 content
is also very low in the local oceans, giving the world
a blue-black appearance when viewed from orbit, with
clouds standing out in stark contrast.
<P>
Ushashin is actually much richer than Third Mu, but
Sternmetal long ago moved to protect its monopoly on
exploiting the local mineral sources. A 199 year lease
was signed in 1007 between the Duke of Deneb and the
company, which gave it exclusive control of the world.
That lease will expire in 1206-1207, and already some
commercial concerns on Lilad have expressed a desire
to compete against Sternmetal.
