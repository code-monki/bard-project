Rhinom is a good example of an ancient Solomani
principle called Dworkin's Law. Every human society
requires a set level of defined deviance, of
boundaries of right and wrong behavior. But balance
must be struck between normality and deviance, so that
in authoritarian or totalitarian societies, given the
strong public prohibitions that exist there must exist
a soft underbelly of private corruption or license to
compensate. In most such societies this takes the form
of sexual freedom, heightened by the constraints of
surveillance and official restriction. On Rhinom it
takes the form of a speculative free market that
borders on the outrageous.<P>

Getting a license to do business is a painful
bureaucratic death march through red tape and
different government ministries. Offworlders need
years of effort and the sponsorship by local business
chambers before getting permission to sell goods in
the general planetary market. Each chamber is akin to
a mercantile guild, but these do little more than set
the competitive guidelines for each industry or local
market. On Rhinom business is a bloodsport, with few
rules other than recognition of the sanctity of those
laws enforced by the government, and private property.
Conflict on the world is uncannily reminiscent of old
trade wars in the old Imperium.  <P>

Though it may seem that the tactics and unsavory
people that such conflicts favor would be contrary in
spirit to a authoritarian society, in reality it helps
soak up the sociopathic tendencies of would be rebels
and dissidents. Businessmen compete for money, power
and status. The corporate spies, security and
guttertrash they hire to do battle come from alienated
sections of the local middle class. Their struggles
are duely recorded in the local media, and quarterly
profit reports are hawked and digested in popular
print and holovision shows. The nature of the local
society is largely free agent in nature, and the most
successful operatives and mercenaries are themselves
celebrated as people of fame and power.
<P>
Against this backdrop the government of the Twylo
family operates quietly, enforcing strict laws against
political opposition, and crushing most dissent. The
cooptation of the most successful "gamesman", whether
spies or business executives, into the local power
structure helps cement loyalty to the regime. A large
underground movement exists on Rhinom, but it is
powerless to change conditions on the world. So far no
Representational Referendum has ever been convened for
a government change.
