Before the Collapse Ronsard was a fishing colony
settled to harvest the bounty of its extensive seas.
But during the Abandonment its climate, and proximity
to the Frontier, made it a primary terminus for
refugee ships. The population has balloned almost a
hundred fold since then. The majority of the world is
covered by a globe spanning ocean, and land is
severely rationed to permit agricultural cultivation.
Investment by groups on nearby Pikha allowed the
construction of man-made islands and floating habitats
to alleviate some of the crowding, but it has also
made the world a junior trading partner reliant upon
the Pikhan economy.
<P>
The local economy is still primary industries that
fish, farm and mine the world for export to Pikha and
its allies. Little resentment exists over this
arrangement, however, as the Pikhans have boosted the
local tech level to stellar levels, and promise to
continue improving local infrastructure, and expanding
educational access to Ronsardians in Pikhan
universities. The opening of the Frontier is likely to
make it a high-population world in its own right, and
the expanded offworld competition will boost Ronsard
further.
<P>
Ronsard's capitol city of Le Croix is unique in being
entirely afloat, and is typical of local oceanic
architecture. These are built of individual floating
structures, conjoined by piers and couplers into large
conurbations that resemble gridiron jellyfish or other
free-floating oceanic life. This enables maximum
stability in the face of storms, but allows for the
breakup into individual structures in case of
structural failure. All local downports are built in
water, and ships make landings directly into the
ocean. Ronsard is one of two Denebian worlds, the
other being Petrarch(Deneb 1712) that is named for a
Solomani poet from Terra's Renaissance period.
