Liiri possesses water only at its poles, and
consequently that is where the majority of its
population and settlements are congregated. The local
government is descended from the personal staff of an
ancient Vilani nobleman that ruled the world early in
the Third Imperial era, and it is famous for its
conservative and isolationist policies. Most Liirians
are themselves very much engaged in interstellar trade
and travel, so these policies seem anomalous.
<P>
The world itself is hot and dry, and constant
windstorms create a haze of dust and moisture.
Centuries of ecological abuse resulted in industrial
dumping that left much of the desert contaminated with
waste and pollutants, and these are picked up by the
wind, poisoning the air and sickening the population.
The inclusion of the world into the IDP was as much to
assist it in its cleanup as it was to provide another
high-tech world in the Midway.  Filter masks are a
grim necessity on this world, as silicosis and other
lung diseases are almost guaranteed after just short
exposure.<P>
The world's grit has been a major problem for the
locals since colonisation in the 230s. Sand and
micron- level dust gets into everything despite the
best containment measures. This can damage electronics
and small motors, mar optics and clog air filtration
plants. To adapt, local industry has moved away from
machinery with moving parts or complex machinery, and
embraced energy fields, simple biomechanics and
degradation proof microelectronics and optics.
Technology manufactured on Liiri is small, simple and
elegant, without the "feature creep" common to other
worlds creations. And it is durable and easily
maintained to an unearthly degree. Since the IDP
improved local tech levels, the world's products have
become important to the Regency economy.
<P>
This elegant simplicity is reflected in the attitudes
of the locals and their surroundings. Complex
ornamentation and large public buildings are eschewed
in favor of simple geometrics, simple living
habitations, and careful use of empty space. Tents,
canopies and other temporary structures are heavily
used to convert courtyards and open fields into
offices and even living quarters. The locals are
nomadic in outlook, and all of their possessions are
designed for easy portability. Relocation for a
Liirian is not a momentous act, for them a house and a
home are two different things. On Liiri all public
space is owned in common, and building a home is as
simple as getting permission from ones neighbors to
setting up ones home. Permanent family structures are
uncommmon, with marriages breaking up as soon as
children are old enough to fend for themselves; to
compensate kinship is a loose and all encompassing
concept, with the young able to draw upon the
resources of their entire extended family for
education and survival.
<P>
Offworld living Liirians are famous for taking their
nonchalant attitude about living quarters with them to
their new worlds of residence. What Liirians call
inhabitance most other world governments call
squatting.
