   <P>


While technically outside of either the Regency or the
Five Sisters, Debarre has become very important for
short jump vessels attempting to journey into or from
the Sisters and nearby Darrian and Regency space.
Debarre plugs the gap between <A href="opal9505.html">Ralhe/Five Sisters</A> and
the X-Web at Flammarion/Sword Worlds.  Ships on their
way to the Darrian Confederacy use the world cut off
the distance to Ator/Daryen to a j-2. This midway
point has attracted a rather eclectic community since
the Collapse.
  <P>
Debarre is a heavily forested world of few
distinguishing physical features or important
resources.  Imperial hunters discovered that the world
possessed diverse fauna, some of them big and
dangerous. Most notable of these was the Debarrean
Bear, a huge 1800 kilogram predator covered in armor
plates.  It was also fast, strong and very deadly. For
Imperial nobility and idle rich in Lunion, Vilis and
Five Sisters subsector, hunting the bear was the
ultimate extreme sport.
  <P>
Even with the most modern weapons and equipment, many
hunters lost their lives to the bear, prompting an
Amber Zone rating. Of course this only enhanced the
allure, and eventually a community of guides and
outfitters sprouted up to support the hunts.  Weapon
restrictions were enforced to make the hunts more
"fair" (risky).  And the casualty rate remainded
fairly constant with few fluctuations. Unfortunately,
the bear's population began to diminish, thanks to the
bacchanal hunting methods and the nonexistence of
either limits or normal conservation practices.
  <P>
The fun ended with the Collapse.  Fearful that the
world would become a contraband funnel, thanks to its
rich clientele and apparent disregard for safety, the
Regency settled an ecological movement on the world in
the aftermath of the Rape of Trin. The Greens, as the
called themselves, imposed hunting limits, cleared out
the more disagreeable hunters and shifted the economy
towards ecologically sound forestry and wetland
agriculture.  This strictness, coupled with the
disenfranchisement of a significant portion of the
worlds clientele, has led to clashes with poachers and
would be filibusters.  And the bears still manage to
take a few lives.
