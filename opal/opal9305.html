   <P>

Cinboshabo was first settled around 310, by colonists
originating within the early Third Imperium.
Unfortunately, the colonists were rather unprepared
for the hardships of colonial life, especially on a
world that was naturally hostile to Human life. Poor
organisation, confusion, poor preparation and
inadequate surveys nearly did in the colony in its
first few decades, and it struggled past hardship in
succeeding years by a razor's width.

 <P>
Cinboshabo owes its survival to the efforts and
interest of the old IISS. In the decades leading up to
the Third Frontier War, the Third Imperium decided to
expand its intel activities in Foreven Sector, and
went looking for suitable worlds for scout bases.
Cinboshabo gladly accepted Imperial tutelage, and the
presence of a scout base, in order to escape its
economic mire. Before the base was constructed in the
970s, Cinboshabo was now a dying third-rate world
incapable of keeping up with what meager trade it
managed to attract. The guaranteed flow of Imperial
money made the surrender of its sovereignty a small
price to pay.

 <P>
The infusion of Imperial money and influence brought
long denied prosperity to the world. The base also had
a polarizing effect upon Imperial-Avalaran relations,
as the latter correctly percieved it to be a threat to
their commercial dominance of Urnian.  This frostiness
culminated in a brief series of naval skirmishes
during the Third Frontier War for the system and
neighboring Ipmokyng (2838), the only significant
Frontier War violence to affect Foreven, and one of
the few times that Avalar forces intervened on their
Zhodani allies behalf.

 <P>
By the Fifth Frontier War, the Cinboshabo base had
grown into one the largest IISS presences in
non-Imperial space.  It anchored the Imperial position
from the Beyond interface, all along the Avalar border
and up into coreward Reidain back to the Darrian
border. Its importance was such that a squadron of
scout cruisers were posted here during the Fifth War,
and again during the first few years of the Civil War
to deter Zhodani mischief. By this time Cinboshabo had
practically become a de facto Imperial world, even
paying taxes to the Imperial treasury.  About forty
percent of the population was of Imperial descent or
origin.

 <P>
Since the Collapse, the base has quietly been expanded
into the primary RQS-RISS hub along the triangular
Avalar-Marrekesh-Regency interface.  Its location
makes it a strategic chokepoint for most traffic
coming up from Beyond Sector, and for most traffic
coming through Novoterre from the Raweh track.  Since
Quarantine regulations are much more loosely enforced
on the Coil, and given all the avenues that smugglers
and pirates can take to avoid the RQS and create
mischief, careful registering of all incoming and
outgoing traffic is a must.  The Cinboshabo base isn't
just for show, its the center of a huge courier
network that feeds information on shipping patterns to
the main SSIIO's along the Five Sisters and Daryen
interfaces, as well as the naval authorities on
Mirriam and Iderati.

 <P>
The RQS presence in Urnian is of the "traffic cop"
nature.  No matter where a trader goes in Urnian and
Reidain subsectors, they will always find RQS and even
Regency Naval scouts surreptitiously patrolling most
major jump and refueling points.  These scouts are
often backed up with surveillance platforms, ground
based skywatch stations, and some local planetary
military and police vessels.  All of the data
collected by sources on arriving, passing and
departing ships is collated, sent to RQS couriers, and
is dumped at Cinboshabo and the local "Lighthouse"
station for analysis. It is then reposted to local
authorities and RQS patrols for their own discretion.

 <P>
About seventy percent of the subsectors surveillance
patrols originate from the local base.  Much of the
world's post-Collapse growth has come from RQS
expansion and related Regency migration. The world has
become so heavily imprinted with Imperial culture that
it is virtually indistinguishable from old Antebellum
Imperial naval outposts in outlook and fervor.
Neighbors prefer to call this exaggerated loyalty to
the Regency for what it is: chauvinism.

 <P>
Factions within the base and the local population are
very politicised, often taking the hardline within a
particular position or ideology. The need for a common
front, or at least the appearance of Regency
legitimacy smooths over the rough spots and
incompatibilities that exist between these factions,
allowing to base and its personnel to function with
cohesiveness. But the extremism of many factions, and
conflicts between progressive democratic, pragmatists
and revanchist pro-noble factions are never far below
the surface, and RQS posts a greater than average
number of internal affairs monitors to keep the
Service appraised of the situation at this critical
base.
