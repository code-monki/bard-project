In antebellum times, Fosfog was a Vargr dominated
world controlled by a bizarre bureaucratic government
known as the Tharrgueroe. It was based upon the
Legalist philosophy of an obscure political theorist
named Ang Tharrguge, who argued that the best form of
utilitarian rulership in the shifting sands of the
Vargr Extents was a rigid, formalised bureaucratic
dictatorship. But unlike most theorists, Tharrguge
added a quasi-mystical vision to his theories, saying
that devotion to this code was the best means of
coming back into harmonious conformance with the
universe. His system dictated a heavy handed mixture
of all encompassing legal codes, police intrusion, and
compulsory egalitarianism.  Even diet, individual
clothing and personal tastes were regulated based upon
government psychological profiling of individual
citizens.
<P>
Daily life on Fofog was dictated by a legal code known
as the Codex of Ordinances, which spelled out
statutary codes for nearly every possible activity.
The Kokhazue, a mixture of police and official
monitors, insured general compliance with the system.
Every citizen had a place determined for it by the
official education system, which predetermined the
careers and economic strata (and even the hobbies and
extracurricular pursuits) of its young through
psychological monitoring as early as age eight.
Offworld influences were not tolerated, and travel and
trade was limited to carefully supervised exchanges.
So omnipresent was the state, and so carefully
cocooned was the populace that it became nearly
impossible to offer an alternative view, or to inject
outside ideas or ideologies without inciting the
locals to violence.
<P>
A Vampire Fleet announced its visit to the system in
1145 with nuclear airbursts that destroyed the capitol
and most other population centers. The survivors were
driven to the starport and its surrounding
communities, and local society nearly collapsed in the
panic. The planetary leadership had been wiped out,
and the surviving Kokhazue took command. The new
leadership dispensed with the secular aspects of their
philosophy, and turned it into a full blown cult
surrounding Tharrguge and his teachings.  Under their
guidance, the survivors were rallied and reorganised,
and reconstruction of the world began. The combination
of a tyrannical government and a zombiefied populace
intent upon "keeping the ball in the air" has actually
worsened the state of this world. Present
circumstances on the world require a return to first
principles, a dim possibility under the current
regime.
