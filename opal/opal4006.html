During the  First Imperium Accra was a quiet relatively backwater agricultural 
world on the Khavle main: a jump-one trade route  encompassing most of the 
subsector and a few worlds in all neighboring subsectors. During the Rule of 
Man the world was put under the supervision of a naval Lt. Commander of 
African decent who when ask by the local bureaucracy to give the world a more 
Solomani name chose that of his hometown  of Accra on Africa`s Ivory coast. 
With its Terra prime environment and low population  (under 600 000 ) this 
world was a prime candidate for colonization by the expanding population of 
Terra. The new settlers came from three distinct groups. The first group was 
from Africa`s Ivory Coast brought  in part by the influence of the new 
planetary governor, the second came from   Scandinavian countries while 
the last originated from the northern part of North America. 
<P> 
 
During Imperial times the population swelled to 90 millions, a mix of the
various founding ethnic groups including a fair amount  descended from 
the original  Vilani colonist. The global tech level was 13, providing  
a very comfortable standard of living. The class B starport  enjoyed a 
large amount traffic mostly in shipping food to the two neighboring high
population worlds of Khavle and  Forward each a mere  parsec away.  
 <P>
 
Then came the rebellion, Accra found itself  in the outlands region of 
Margaret`s Domain a faction which it had wholeheartedly supported. With 
the rise of piracy,  declining trade and  tech level Accra joined its 
two biggest trade partners to form the Khavle Accordment . Thanks to a bit 
of help from Khavle  it manage to stabilized it tech level to 11 and for 
a few years actually enjoyed a semblance of prosperity. All this can to an 
end when in 1133  a  large Vampire fleet wreaked havoc up and down the 
Khavle main  introducing  Virus to the world  computer net which thus far 
had managed to contain the infection to the starport area.  
 <P>
In addition to the initial damage cause by the Vampire fleet  the newly 
released Virus caused chaos in the world's highly automated farm industry
and eventually the world was plunged into a wide civil war over resources. 
Groups based on old ethnic affiliation rose up and attempted to take control 
of what remained.
 <P>
In 1134 a convoy of refugees  from  what was left of Margaret`s Domain landed
on the world.  Their original destination was the Union of Suffren but the 
failure of several ships made them opt for Accra  which at the time offered 
the best environmental condition for survival (By this time Forward and 
Khavle where both dying world and Tsian was too far away  to risk the 
additional jump).
 <P>
 
The group was lead by what was left of the Order of the Blue Feather. An order 
of knighthood  based in Margaret Domain. The leaders had  theorized (and 
rightly so) that the small polities outside faction`s safe  area where more 
likely to survive since they already had to adjusted to the harsh condition 
of the Outlands and Wilds. The Union of Suffren was among the strongest and 
best organized in Diaspora sector and offered the best odds unfortunately 
the constant battle with the fleet`s ship and their computers forced them 
to settle something more immediate and Accra seemed like the best prospect. 
They landed on an isolated island named Victoria on the opposite side of 
the planets main population center. Victoria is comparable in size to 
Terra`s Cuba. Its only town, with a population of about 10,000 used the 
island as a resort  and were mainly involved in tourism related industries.
 
Over the next decades the planet decayed into barbarism technology sliding
down to 6. In the mean time the refugees gradually built up their island now 
organized in the independent nation of  Victoria.   The original transport ship 
formed the nucleus for an underwater settlement. A few basic industries were 
set up using some equipment the group had brought with them but mostly  relied 
on local "salvage".  The Victorian can be said to be the first  to have  
pioneered  Smash and Grab  operations. To this day Victoria still retains the 
world Hard Time era  locally sustainable tech level of 11 and even managed to  
move beyond this in certain fields . Some might argue that the Victorian salvage 
operations help the  decline of technology but at that time the few remaining  
TL-11 factories had been converted to military use and contributed little to 
the civilian population. 
<P>
In  1150 situation had calmed down, many of the Accrean nation settling into 
the all too familiar pattern of technologically elevated dictatorship rule and 
petty brush wars. Most in Victoria would have been happy to remain unnoticed 
and let their fellow worlders to their fate but this was not to be so. The 
Order of the Blue Feather was still quite alive and part of the knight's oath 
was to defend all imperial  citizens from its enemies what ever form they 
might take and to " preserve and reestablish the best of all possible society
in modern times " (D. Meyers, Challenge no. 47). The knight could not 
simply  accept the status quo , they were honorbound to help their fellow 
citizens. 
<P> 
Preliminary studies showed that to simply recontact the other nations and 
share their technology would be wasted by renewed competition  between the 
various warlords. They instead opted for a subtle approach. Covert  agent were 
sent across the planet and discretely disseminated technical know how 
They were also the ones responsible for the convenient finds of  TL-13  
part needed by each nation to either reactivate or maintain the old PAD system
to help fend off Vampire depredation. They also took more drastic steps, 
launching decapitation raids on the more oppressive TED by both 
masquerading as local freedom movements and by actually setting up and 
supporting such movements. Although some might see some Hiver influences in 
the choice of methods, Margaret`s Domain had extensive trade relations with 
the Hive Federation before the collapse, this is not the case. The true 
origins  of the matter are  among the refugees  which included many former 
members of IRIS the Imperial Regency of Intelligence and Security. These 
were the real influence behind the Orders decision on how to proceed and 
by the same token provided a highly trained and experience corporation  
around which to build the new Victorian intelligence  services. 
 
<P>
Over the last 30 years the overall  global tech level has climbed back to 9. 
Competition between regional and ethnic factions is still present, over the 
last 20 years a new source of disputed has erupted splitting the world even 
further.  Some of planet few remaining TEDs and other more repressive 
governments  have enlisted support form the roving vampire fleets traveling 
up and down the Vampire Main in order not only to retain their hold on power 
but also to expand it at their neighbors expense.  The other more pluralistic 
nations see this as a direct threat and rightly so. In some case the 
pro-virus nations have no choice as their territory include little if any 
PAD facilities making them  more vulnerable, giving them few alternatives, 
some are rule by religious groups who worship Virus while others simply 
see this as a way to increase their power.
 
<P>
As of 1202  sporadic fighting still goes on. The Knight are still mostly a 
myth as far as the rest of the planet is concerned. Technology as stalled 
to TL-9 as the Victorians feel these is sufficient for the moment and are 
reluctant to introduce more advances until the world nations resolve their 
differences. The Covenant of  Suffren  make occasional  patrol in the system 
but do not interfere with passing vampire fleets, their job is to observe 
their  movements not fight  them off. The Victorian on the other hand 
realize that the isolated location of their island is no longer enough to 
keep them  relatively safe and have begun  a more aggressive industrialization 
program and military build up. Their ground forces are outfitted to TL-11 
standard with a few relic and new experimental  stiffening. The knights 
have manage to preserve a streamlined yacht  and an old TL-11 corsair  
in working order. This last ship was once part of the small Accordment 
navy and was built on nearby  Medora which during that time had one of 
the few remains starship yard in the sector.  They also have also 
salvaged a few TL-11 Termigan class fighters also once the part of the 
Accordment navy which they are reverse-engineering and are  in the process 
of setting up a facility to produce additional craft . Their small fleet 
is based in an old class F spaceport part of the original settlement. 
They would be quite  agreeable to contact with the Covenant  and/or the R.C.
They have occasionally detected  the presence of the Covenant patrols and have 
had some dealings with Free Traders and are thus aware of the presence of  an 
organized polity in the area. They are also quite aware of the existence
of the Guild which make occasional  runs  to Accra.
