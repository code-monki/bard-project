<h3>Geology</h3> Urnian is the third moon of its systems
innermost gas giant, Sayuri.  The world is a T-Prime
system with a standard atmosphere and slightly higher
than normal gravitation. It has the normal geological
structures normally encountered on a T-Prime, albeit
with higher seismic stress factors. Urnian is a middle
aged world, about 300 million years younger than
Terra, and retains more heat from its formation.
Combined with gravitational tidal forces from Sayuri,
the world is often wracked by earthquakes, and rifting
that floods a region with hot basaltic lava.
 <P>
The other gas giants were formed further away from the
systems star, and their gravitation dislodged Kuiper
disk material towards the inner system, much of it
being pulled towards Sayuri by its gravitational
attraction. As a result Urnian and her sisters possess
very rich mineral deposits, especially nickel and
iron, seeded on the world by cometary impacts and
meteorite strikes.
 <P>
<h3>Ecology</h3> Urnian had a very complex ecosystem before
the Solomani colonization.  Most of its dry land were
covered with huge colonial plant/fungus species known
as Krags, similar in ecological form and function as
undersea coral reefs. Krags only have minimal
photosynthesis ability, but provide shelter and
nutrients for microorganisms that can photosynthesize.
 <P>
The world had large land vertebrates, and a variety of
airborne and flying animals that dominated the local
food chain.  Most significant of these were the Urnian
Dragons, massive pterodactyl-like psuedoreptilian
creatures with wingspans between 12 and 25 meters.
Like Terra's Bird of Paradise, the Dragons had
brillantly colored sections of their hide for
camoflauge, signalling and mate attraction. Most
Dragon species, alas, are extinct.
 <P>
In fact about seventy percent of the world has been
extinguised by hunting, habitat destruction, and the
massive aerial and water pollution created by the
world's carelessly designed, constructed and run
industry. The industry has so severly polluted the
air, that filtermasks must be worn outside, and even
those are of less and less utility. The air is
breathable for short periods, but 12 hours without a
filtermask will cause permanent lung damage, and
possible blood poisoning or brain damage.
 <P>
<h3>History</h3> Urnian subsector, and Urnian itself, were
settled around -1700 by some especially enterprising
refugees fleeing the disintegration of the Rule of
Man. Many of these colonists included military
deserters and runaway minor nobility, attracted by the
world's rich resources and moderate climate. This
eclectic mixture included armed groups led by leaders
that can only be described as "gothic" in their
motivations and means. The diversity of the
population, and the same fluidity of the political
environment that existed on Novoterre, compelled these
early leaders into paraoxysms of extreme violence and
despotism.
 <P>
The early colony was dominated by a theatrical
Solomani general named Oliver Beardsley, whose ruling
acumen seemed to rest upon intensifying paranoia. His
deterioration culminated in the slaughter of a third
of the original colonists, before he went insane and
was bludgeoned to death in public square by a vengeful
mob. His rule set the model followed by nearly all of
Urnian's subsequent rulers.
 <P>
The unified ruling class of nobility evolved out of
the military strongmen that took over the world in the
aftermath of Beardsley's overthrow. The previous
struggle for control over the world against the
backdrop of intercommunal hostility and the threat of
offworld maruaders or neighboring warlords created an
isolated elite fearfully protective of their lives and
priveleges in the wake of what they percieved to be
great sacrifice for themselves, and the pretence that
it was for the good of their subjects.
 <P>
The protocols and internal relations of these nobles
were less an orderly system than a Darwinian struggle
of all against all. Urnian had a "struggle" culture
where most outlets for sucess and prestige were
literally battlefields of manuever and intrigue where
it was every man or woman for themselves. Petty
empires dominated by shortlived dynasties were the
rule.  The only basis for continuity was the massive
bureaucracy that evolved to preserve Urnian society
and infrastructure from the rollercoaster progression
of these dynasties, and to run the factories and farms
essential to the continued health of the people.
 <P>
Because war and military strength were the paramount
means by which these rulers came to power, war became
the basis of the economy as well. Urnian rulers
dowered the natural wealth of their homeworld upon
themselves with gluttonous avarice.  Native species
were hunted and harried out of existence. Mining
operations scarred the world. Chemical exhaust and
effluent was discharged untreated into the air and
water. Massive construction projects were pursued to
indulge the pharoanic delusions of the ruling class.
 <P>
Huge souless factories created mountains of munitions
for sale to any buyer with the money or credit to do
so. And if business slowed, the Urnian military and
foriegn service were only too obliging to create new
markets through predatory attacks and intrigue against
stable or stabilising worlds. In their hunger for
profit and prestige, Urnian sold arms as far away as
Far Frontiers and the Zhodani border interface. This
trade destabilised much of Foreven, and helped
contribute to the polarisation between the Third
Imperium and the Zhodani Consulate.
 <P>
When the Third Imperium contacted Urnian in 195,
relations between them started cold, but slowly warmed
up throughout the Imperial period. The process was
slow due to the constant succession of dynasties, but
it grew as the nobility came to trust the Imperium as
a mentor and protector. By this time, Urnian was
accumulating enemies, like the Avalar Union and the
Kamrati League, opposed to their malignant presence.
The Third Imperium chose to overlook their bad habits,
reasoning that their boorish policies were an
effective weapon against Zhodani influence in Foreven.
No one ever accused the TI of having good judgement of
foresight.
 <P>
The last reigning dynasty was the Utsukushi family
(1035-1137). Led by Herman Utsukishi (pronounced
Uts-keh-she, with the stress on the first syllable),
relations with the Imperium reached their summit, and
Urnian hit rockbottom.  Herman hoped that Urnian would
either become the capitol of a new Imperial subsector,
or more likely, the seat of power of a new client
state dominating Urnian from Avalar to the Imperial
interface.
 <P>
Herman died in 1082, and power passed to his weak son
Anders, who suffered from a degenerative disease now
thought to have been syphilis.  The real power behind
him was his wife Agena, and when she died in 1105, she
was supplanted by their daughter Leila.  Leila
Utsukishi was a veteran of Urnian's intrigue wars, and
had served as an intelligence agent for INI. She was
coldly ruthless where her peers were poor imitations
of monster trideos. Having accumulated a power base
within the hitherto nuetral bureaucracy, she had her
father assassinated in his bed in 1107 and took power
in her own right.  She wasted no time in purging the
nobility and the populace of disloyal elements.
 <P>
In a departure from previous dynasts, Leila made the
bureaucracy the main seat of her authority, seeking to
undercut her less capable noble rivals.  She tightened
laws against dissent, enhanced the local military and
security services, and expanded operations against
neighboring worlds, particularly Pylkah and Novoterre.
Urnian mercenaries hired by other nearby worlds became
active invasion or coercion forces when their
contracts expired.  By the time of the Collapse, Leila
Utsukishi had a growing portion of Urnian under her
control.
 <P>
Unfortunately for Leila, three things interceded
against her. First of all, the Regency was distancing
itself from foreign dictators like the Utsukishi, and
were actively opposing military aggression such as
that being mounted from Urnian.  The Regency had
already been embarrassed by the Avalar's suprise
landgrab, and they were containing or evicting her
troops from their illgotten gains. The second thing
was Leila's inattention to concieving a successor. The
third was her own mental instability, and growing
isolation from her own power base.  The bureaucracy
new firsthand that Urnian could not afford its
aggressiveness anymore and that centuries of
ecological degradation had to be addressed, and their
protests were being silently ignored.
 <P>
Leila Utsukishi died under mysterious circumstances in
1135.  Attempts by the other remaining nobles to seize
power were opposed by the bureaucracy. A long period
of internal civil war lasted until 1147, with the
bureaucrats eliminating or neutering the nobility.
Military production dipped for about twenty years, and
the world went into an economic depression as it
struggled to create new markets for itself.
 <P>
Presently Urnian is in a struggle between day-to-day
survival and the growing ecological debt runup by
centuries of misrule.  Some attempts at ecological
repair have stabilised the ecosphere, preventing
further degradation.  It has had some success at
converting to new markets, and Regency aid enabled the
construction of a new A-class starport and new
non-military industrial programs.  But the most
lucrative markets in the wake of the Collapse remain
munition exports, this time mostly in support of the
Regency and Aslan Quarantines.  This is something of a
paradox, as it is the munition factories that are the
worst polluters, yet the amount money needed for
ecological recovery and economic transition can only
from their output.  This contradiction plays out as
infighting between government agencies, oftentimes
putting the world as cross-purposes with itself.
 <P>
<h3>Culture</h3> (The following information was recieved from
Berka.)
 <P>
The ruling class of Urnian has a strange ritual where
they parade once per year in front of the populace,
wearing a "hat" consisting of a <a href="http://zho.berka.com/bestiary/brainsuc.html">deadly animal</A> from the
nearby world of  Ronu (Foreven 2632).
<P>
Like I said, these people are a strange and gothic
bunch.

<B>System Notes:</B> Urnian contains the Regency naval base,
while Ivanhoe is controlled by the Urnian world
forces.
 <P>
Sapphiro contains an old research station once run by
Naasirka. It is currently controlled by a consortium
of smaller Regency and Darrian electronic corps.
 <P>
Cosonor is heated by an unusual active geothermal
source, and by radiant energy transmitted from Aoki by
its magnetic fields.  The world has native life that
is still poorly understood.  Fortunately Cosonor had
little in the way of natural resources, otherwise it
might have shared the same fate as the mainworld.
