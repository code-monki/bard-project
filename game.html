BARD is the reference library for the common Reformation 
Coalition Citizen.  On the surface, that is.  Beneath the 
surface, BARD is much, much more.<P>

BARD is the main intelligence storage facility for the 
Coalition.  BARD is the main point of contact for the 
free trader network, and many Coalition operations are 
planned by the BARD group.  Simply, all intelligence 
information in the Coalition will usually pass through 
BARD before being disseminated.<P>

In game terms, this means that most players will be 
briefed and debriefed by BARD workers before and after 
any missions they undertake.  BARD will often be responsible 
for deciding who gets assigned to what missions.<P>

The BARD Library currently consists of eleven different 
departments, each concentrating on a particular aspect of 
the Traveller game. The departments are listed below along 
with the extended name and what aspects of the game can be 
found in the files of that department.<P>

Throughout the BARD Library, there are small nuggets that 
are placed to enhance adventures with the 'color' of the 
RC.  Many of the complaints about TNE are about the 
military nature of the adventures.  The non-game purpose 
of BARD is to make TNE and the RC specifically less of a 
military place and more of an adventurers haven.

We hope you enjoy,<BR>
