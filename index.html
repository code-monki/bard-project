BARD is the Reformation Coalition's compilation of 
library data.  BARD's primary task is to facilitate 
tourism and trade as well as to provide general 
information to Coalition citizens. The BARD system 
currently contains only a limited amount of information.  
Much of the pre-Collapse Imperial information was found 
to be incorrect and must be re-examined before being 
released.  As new reports are developed, Director 
Philibus will announce the addition on COALINFONET.<BR>
